Preface

This 11th edition of The Global Risks
Report is published at a time of
profound change. Global risks
materialize in new and unexpected
ways and are becoming more
imminent as their consequences reach
people, institutions and economies.
We witness the effects of climate
change in the rising frequency and
intensity of water shortages, floods and
storms worldwide. Stable societies are
becoming increasingly fragmented in
many regions of the world, and we
note a weak global economy that is
again facing headwinds.
At the same time, advances in
technology and rapid digitization are
fundamentally transforming societies,
economies and ways of doing
business. Often referred to as the
Fourth Industrial Revolution, this
development presents great
opportunities for all actors involved and
a previously unimagined solution
space for some of the world’s most
pressing problems. Yet it also presents
elusive risks related to changing
employment patterns, widening
income inequality and rising cyber
dependence. Managing the paradigm
shift and transition process will be
critical to securing stable economies
and ultimately thriving societies.
Achieving this calls for greater
resilience as the key imperative for
action. Collaboration across countries,
areas of expertise and stakeholder
groups is necessary to effectively
address global risks and deliver on the
resilience imperative. Yet across every
sector of society, decision-makers are
struggling to find common ground as
they are faced with heightened
volatility, uncertainty,
interconnectedness and pace of
change.

The Global Risks Report 2016

The motivations underlying The Global
Risks Report at its inception in 2006
– to shed light on global risks and
developments and help create a
shared understanding of the most
pressing issues confronting the world,
the ways they interconnect and their
potential negative impacts – are
therefore more relevant than ever. A
shared understanding of challenges is
needed as a base for multistakeholder
collaboration, which has seen
increasing recognition as the most
effective way to address global risks
and build resilience against them. To
further inspire action, this year’s
Report, like last year’s, also contributes
to a shared understanding of the
solution space, presenting examples of
risk mitigation and resilience practices
in the Risks in Focus section. In
addition this year’s Global Risk Report
includes a chapter dedicated to better
understanding the evolving
international security landscape and
improving outcomes.
As in previous years, the Report is
based on the annual Global Risks
Perception Survey, completed by
almost 750 members of the World
Economic Forum’s global
multistakeholder community. In
addition to the special section
exploring the evolving security
landscape in an era of uncertainty, the
Report presents deep-dive
discussions of risks to the stability of
societies posed by the (dis)empowered
citizen, who is empowered by
technology but feels disempowered by
traditional decision-making processes.
It also discusses the societal
consequences of climate change with
a focus on food and water crises and
the threat of global pandemics.
As one of the Forum’s flagship reports,
The Global Risks Report has been a
collaborative effort since its first edition
in 2006. Produced by the Forum, it is
able to draw on the unique expertise
available within the Forum’s different
communities and knowledge networks
as well as within the organization as a
whole. It also builds firmly on the
Forum’s ongoing research, projects,
debates and initiatives. The insights
presented here are the result of
numerous discussions, consultations
and workshops and reflect the views of
leaders from our various communities
through the Global Risks Perception
Survey.

With this in mind, I would like to thank
our Strategic Partners, Marsh &
McLennan Companies and the Zurich

Executive
Summary

Now in its 11th edition, The Global Risks
Report 2016 draws attention to ways
that global risks could evolve and
interact in the next decade. The year
2016 marks a forceful departure from
past findings, as the risks about which
the Report has been warning over the
past decade are starting to manifest
themselves in new, sometimes
unexpected ways and harm people,
institutions and economies. Warming
climate is likely to raise this year’s
temperature to 1° Celsius above the
pre-industrial era, 60 million people,
equivalent to the world’s 24th largest
country and largest number in recent
history, are forcibly displaced, and
crimes in cyberspace cost the global
economy an estimated US$445 billion,1
higher than many economies’ national
incomes. In this context, the Report
calls for action to build resilience – the
“resilience imperative” – and identifies
practical examples of how it could be
done.

Box 1: Definition of Global
Risks and Trends
A global risk is an uncertain event
or condition that, if it occurs, can
cause significant negative impact
for several countries or industries
within the next 10 years.
A global trend is a long-term
pattern that is currently taking place
and that could contribute to
amplifying global risks and/or
altering the relationship between
them.

Geopolitical concerns remain
prominent in the minds of respondents
to the Global Risks Perception Survey
for the second year in a row. The
Report therefore delves into the
international security landscape and
explores what drives this evolution and,
in particular, how it could be affected
by the Fourth Industrial Revolution and
climate change. The three scenarios
for possible futures developed in this
context inform new ways of building
resilience to security threats through
public-private collaboration.

Global Risks 2015

The Report also steps back and
explores how emerging global risks
and major trends (see Box 1), such as
climate change, the rise of cyber
dependence and income and wealth
disparity are impacting already-strained
societies by highlighting three clusters
of risks as Risks in Focus. As resilience
building is helped by the ability to
analyse global risks from the
perspective of specific stakeholders,
the Report also analyses the
significance of global risks to the
business community at a regional and
country-level.

The Global Risks
Perception Survey
Almost 750 experts and decisionmakers in the World Economic Forum’s
multistakeholder communities
responded to this year’s Global Risks
Perception Survey. Respondents are
drawn from business, academia, civil
society and the public sector and span
different areas of expertise,
geographies and age groups.
The survey asked respondents to
consider 29 global risks – categorized
as societal, technological, economic,
environmental or geopolitical – over a
10-year time horizon, and rate each
according to their perceived likelihood
of it occurring and impact if it does.
After its presence in the top five most
impactful risks for the past three years,
the failure of climate change
mitigation and adaptation has risen
to the top and is perceived in 2016 as
the most impactful risk for the years to
come, ahead of weapons of mass
destruction, ranking 2nd, and water
crises, ranking 3rd. Large-scale
involuntary migration was also rated
among the top five for impact, as was
severe energy price shock (increase
or decrease).
The risk rated most likely was largescale involuntary migration, with last
year’s top scorer – interstate conflict
with regional consequences – giving
way to the environmental risks of
extreme weather events and the
failure of climate change mitigation
and adaptation and followed by major
natural catastrophes.

Global risks that remain serious
because of their combined impact and
likelihood involve some economic risks,
including fiscal crises in key
economies and high structural
unemployment and
underemployment. These are
complemented by cyberattacks and
profound social instability. Their
assessment reflects the potentially
profound impact of the Fourth Industrial
Revolution on the economy and society
and emphasizes the need for
safeguarding future benefits.
Respondents were also asked which
risks were related and could give rise to
cascading risks. Three emerged
strongly: the potential for climate
change to exacerbate water crises,
with impacts including conflicts and
more forced migration, calling for
improved water governance to adapt to
climate change and accommodate a
growing population and economic
development; the need to address the
global refugee crisis, adding
emphasis to policies that can build
resilience in addition to responding to
the immediate crisis; and the risks of
failing to fully understand the risks
around the Fourth Industrial Revolution
and how this transition will impact
countries, economies and people at a
time of persistently sluggish growth.

Risks in Focus
Key to building resilience is the stability
of societies. The first Risk in Focus
therefore looks at the complex
dynamics of societies in the age of
digitization and discusses the
phenomenon of the (dis)empowered
citizen, which is a result of the interplay
of varying dynamics: as technology
empowers citizens to find information,
connect with others and organize,
those citizens feel disenfranchised by
distant elites. It explores the risk of
social instability if both governments
and business embark on either
repressive actions or non-action out of
uncertainty about how to deal with a
more informed, connected and
demanding citizenry, which could lead
to an escalating downward spiral of
broken trust and harsher response on
either side. The chapter also, however,
explores the benefits governments and
business stand to gain by proactively

looking for ways to engage with
concerned citizens.
Food security risk in the context of
climate change is the second Risk in
Focus. Building upon the climate-water
nexus discussed in Part 1, the chapter
looks at how changing climate and
weather patterns could jeopardize food
security and agricultural production
across geographies. The most climatevulnerable countries often heavily
depend on agricultural productivity to
sustain economic growth and
development. But the recent years
have also shown the climate
vulnerability of G-20 countries such as
India, Russia and the United States
– the breadbasket of the world – and
other large industrial producers of
agricultural commodities. The chapter
discusses how climate change–resilient
crops and supply chain networks, as
well as financing and insurance
schemes, can help mitigate the social,
economic and environmental aspects
of food security risks related to climate
change.
Drawing lessons from the Ebola crisis,
the third Risk in Focus discusses
global disease outbreaks. It warns
that population growth, rapid
urbanization and increasing
transnational flows of commodities,
people and animals intensify the risk of
infectious transmission across
geographies while equally diminishing
the ability to respond – all at a time of
growing resistance of microorganisms
to today’s most effective medicines.
Preparedness and response measures
range from the behavioural, such as
fact-based communication and
education campaigns, to the need to
invest in diagnostic, drug and vaccine
R&D and in its enabling environment,
especially advancing a regulatory
framework. It raises the imperative for
public-private sector collaboration
across areas such as data availability
and analysis, a joint research agenda,
regulatory frameworks, long-term
financing and ways to promote
responsible media engagement as part
of effective crisis management
communication.

Risks to Doing Business
Private sector respondents to the World
Economic Forum’s Executive Opinion
Survey were asked to identify their risks
of highest concern for doing business in
the next 10 years. The responses, from
140 economies, reveal patterns of
concern at country and regional levels
that can usefully inform initiatives to
engage the private sector in building
resilience to global risks.
On a global scale, two economic risks
– unemployment and
underemployment and energy price
shocks – are mentioned as the top risks
of highest concern for doing business in
half of the 140 economies. These are
followed by the failure of national
governance, fiscal crises, asset bubbles
and cyberattacks.
Economic risks predominate in
responses from Europe, including fiscal
crises, unemployment, asset bubbles
and energy prices – the latter also being
the top concern in Canada – while
executives in the United States are most
concerned about cyber-related risks and
attacks. Respondents from Central Asia
and Russia worry about fiscal crises and
unemployment, along with the risks of
unmanageable inflation and interstate
conflict. Environmental risks worry
business leaders in East Asia and the
Pacific, alongside energy prices, asset
bubbles, and cyber attacks.
In South Asia concerns also include
energy prices, together with fiscal crises,
unemployment and failure of national
governance – which is the top concern in
Latin America and the Caribbean
– followed by energy prices shock and
unemployment. Executives in the Middle
East and North Africa likewise worry
about energy prices, together with
unemployment, terrorist attacks and
interstate conflict. In Sub-Saharan
Africa, the business community’s top
concerns include unemployment, energy
prices, the failure of national governance
and the failure of critical infrastructure.

For each Risk in Focus, examples are
given of three practical mechanisms
that can build resilience against the
identified threats.

Introduction

Over the past decade, The Global
Risks Report has expanded its scope
from analysing the interconnected
and rapidly evolving nature of global
risks to also putting forward actionable
solutions and calling for publicprivate collaboration in strengthening
resilience. Now in its 11th edition, the
Report describes a world in which
risks are becoming more imminent and
have wide-ranging impact: tensions
between countries affect businesses;
unresolved, protracted crises have
resulted in the largest number of
refugees globally since World War II;
terrorist attacks take an increasing toll
on human lives and stifle economies;
droughts occur in California and floods
in South Asia; and rapid advances in
technologies are coupled with evergrowing cyber fragilities and persistent
unemployment and underemployment.
Implications of sweeping digitization
(also termed the “Fourth Industrial
Revolution”), ranging from
transformations that are the result of
rising cyber connectivity to the potential
effects of innovations on socioeconomic equality and global security,
remain far from fully understood. At
the same time, climate change is
unequivocally happening, and there is
no turning back time.
The increasing volatility, complexity
and ambiguity of the world not only
heightens uncertainty around the
“which”, “when”, “where” and “who”
of addressing global risks, but also
clouds the solutions space. We need
clear thinking about new levers that will
enable a wide range of stakeholders
to jointly address global risks, which
cannot be dealt with in a centralized
way.
Taken together, this calls for a resilience
imperative – an urgent necessity to find
new avenues and more opportunities
to mitigate, adapt to and build resilience
against global risks and threats
through collaboration among different
stakeholders.
By putting the resilience imperative at
its core, this year’s Global Risks Report
combines four parts to present an
analysis of different aspects of global
risks – across both global risks and
stakeholders – focused as much on the
search for solutions as on the analysis
of the risks themselves.

that could materialize unless there
is a change in how we respond and

Part 3 explores three risks clusters
that have the potential to challenge
social stability. For each of these “Risks
in Focus”, it describes three existing,
practical initiatives that could help to
build resilience. The concept of the
(dis)empowered citizen is introduced
to describe the tensions created
by growing cyber connectivity that
empowers citizens at the same time as
they feel increasingly disenfranchised
from traditional decision-making
processes. The second contribution
further explores one impact of climate
change: coupled with rising population
growth, it is threatening food security.
Finally, in the wake of the Ebola crisis,
the potential of pandemics to threaten
social cohesion is discussed.

Part 3

From the refugee crisis to economic
slowdowns in emerging markets,
from ever-rising numbers of terrorist
and cyberattacks to water shortages,
global risks have been in the headlines
in the last year. Yet so have initiatives
to address them, such as the COP21
meeting on reducing greenhouse gas
emissions or European Union (EU)
summits to address the refugee crisis.1
The Global Risks Report exists to raise
awareness about global risks and
their potential interconnections, and
to provide a platform for discussion
and action to mitigate, adapt and
strengthen resilience.

Part 4

There is remarkable stability in this
year’s Global Risks Landscape (Box
1.1): many risks that are assessed as
above average in terms of likelihood
and impact were similarly assessed last
year. This suggests the emergence of a
new status quo, with geopolitical risks –
such as interstate conflict or terrorist
attacks2 – being at the forefront.
Other risks rated as highly impactful
or likely, such as involuntary migration
and social instability, are partly a result
of spillover effects of insecurity and
conflict. Some geopolitical risks – such
as the failure of national governance,
which is pervasive across Latin
America and Sub-Saharan Africa (see
Figure 3) and considered to be among
the top three most likely risks in the
Middle East and North Africa, East Asia
and the Pacific, and Central Asia – are
considered to be important in some
regions but not globally impactful.
Consistent with the past, weapons
of mass destruction is ranked as the
second least likely risk to occur, but
the second most impactful if it were
to. Part 2 of this Report explores the
international security landscape and
how it could evolve in future.
Also prominent in the Global Risks
Landscape 2016 are environmental
risks such as failure of climatechange mitigation and adaptation,
which is considered the most
potentially impactful risk and the
third most likely, with water crises,3
biodiversity loss and ecosystem
collapse rising up the list of concerns.
Environmental worries have been at
the forefront in recent years (Figure
1.1.1), reflecting a sense that climate
change–related risks have moved
from hypothetical to certain because

Part 1

Box 1.1: Methodology of The Global Risks Report

Part 2

This Report defines a “global risk” as an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, can cause significant negative impact for
several countries or industries within the next 10 years. Based on this refined definition, this year 29 global risks were identified
and grouped into the five customary categories: economic, environmental, geopolitical, societal and technological. A
description of the risks and the methodology employed can be found in Appendices A and B.
The Report also identifies 13 global trends that can potentially drive global risks. A “trend” is defined as a long-term pattern that
is currently taking place and that could contribute to amplifying global risks and/or altering the relationship between them.
Unlike risks, trends are occurring with certainty and can have both positive and negative consequences. Trends can alter how
risks evolve and interrelate, and they inform efforts at risk mitigation.

Note: Global risks may not be strictly comparable across years, as definitions and the set of global risks have evolved with new issues emerging on the 10-year horizon.
For example, cyberattacks, income disparity and unemployment entered the set of global risks in 2012. Some global risks were reclassified: water crises and rising
income disparity were re-categorized first as societal risks and then as a trend in the 2015 and 2016 Global Risks Reports, respectively. The 2006 edition of the Global
Risks Report did not have a risks landscape.

As in previous years, assessments of risks in this year’s Report are based on the Global Risks Perception Survey. The survey
captures the perceptions of almost 750 experts and decision-makers in the World Economic Forum’s multistakeholder
communities and was conducted in Fall 2015. Respondents are drawn from business, academia, civil society and the public
sector and span different areas of expertise, geographies and age groups.
The analysis takes into account three complementary angles on global risks: an assessment of their likelihood and impact
(Figure 1), and how these have evolved over the years (Figure 1.1.1); a regional breakdown of the perceived likelihood of risks
(Figure 3); a mapping of interconnections among risks (Figure 2) and among risks and trends (Figure 4); and the difference of
the level of concern in the short and long term (Figure 1.2).

insufficient action has been undertaken
to address them.

Part 2

Figure 1.1 shows risks that have
registered the highest increases and
declines in perceptions of likelihood
and impact, notably large-scale
involuntary migration, now rated
as the most likely and fourth most
impactful. Other risks gaining in
prominence on both dimensions
include profound social instability
– also one of the most highly
interconnected risks, as shown in
Figure 2.

Part 3
Part 4

The economic risks of unemployment
and underemployment, asset
bubbles, and fiscal crises in key
economies have increased in both
likelihood and impact over the past
two years, although these have been
overtaken by other concerns. At the
same time, cyber threats remain at
the top of respondents’ minds, as in
previous years.

To tease apart short- and longerterm thinking and shed light on the
psychology behind the responses,
the survey asked experts to nominate
risks of highest concern over two
time horizons: 18 months and 10
years. Global risks that have recently
been in the headlines – such as
large-scale involuntary migration,
interstate conflict and cyberattacks –
tend to feature higher as short-term
concerns, indicating that recent events
significantly influence our thinking
about risks and, hence, stakeholder
action.
The longer-term concerns are more
related to underlying physical and
societal trends, such as the failure
of climate change mitigation and
adaptation, water crises and food
crises. Interestingly, extreme weather
events and social instability are
considered a concern in both the short
and long term, reflecting an expectation
that the frequency and intensity of
crises will continue to rise. One of
the roles of this Report is to raise

Figure 1.1: The Changing Global Risks Landscape 2015–2016: The 10 Most
Changing Global Risks

awareness about the importance of
long-term thinking about global risks –
especially significant when it comes to
attempting to limit the extent of climate
change and to adapt to the change
that is already inevitable.
Three risk clusters are discussed in
more detail below: the cluster linking
the failure of climate change mitigation
and adaptation with water crises and
large-scale involuntary migration; the
cluster linking large-scale involuntary
migration with a range of risks related
to social and economic stability;
and the cluster linking economic
global risks with uncertainty around
the impacts of the Fourth Industrial
Revolution.

Coping with the Changing
Climate
Climate change and water crises,
which have featured prominently in the
Global Risks Landscape over the last
five years, are joined this year by largescale involuntary migration. The links
among these risks appear clearly in
the Global Risks Interconnections Map
2016 (Figure 2), and the intertwined
challenges are unfolding against a
background of many socio-economic
pressures.
As illustrated by the Global Risks
Interconnections Map, climate change
and water risks are intricately linked
to food security concerns – a subject
explored further in Part 3 of this Report.
About 70% of the world’s current
freshwater withdrawals are used
for agriculture, rising to over 90% in
most of the world’s least-developed
countries.4 Carbon dioxide also causes
ocean acidification, which makes it
harder for small shellfish to form the
calcium carbonite shells they need to
grow – with implications rising up the
food chain, threatening the availability
of food from the seas as well.5

Report 2015. To identify them, we take the distance between the two years for each risk, in absolute terms.

The Global Risks Report 2016

Challenges around water management
are already immense. On the one
hand, over a billion people lack access
to improved water. Some 2.7 billion
– or 40% of the world’s population –
suffer water shortages for at least a
month each year.6 The Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and

Part 1

Figure 1.2: The Top Five Global Risks of Highest Concern for the Next 18 Months
and 10 Years

Governance – at global, regional
and national levels – lies at the
heart of water management. Even
many developed countries are
failing to proactively address water
vulnerabilities, instead reacting only
after extreme weather events. In
developing countries, the political
challenges inherent in water
infrastructure and conservation
projects are exacerbated by greater
financing challenges.

Brazil exemplifies the challenge of
managing water even within a single
country: it has 12% of the planet’s
freshwater reserves, mostly in the
Amazon region, but much of this water
does not reach its urban population.
Sao Paulo, which contributes a third
of Brazil’s GDP, has a lower waterper-capita availability than even the
historically drought-prone northeastern region of the country. With
hydropower constituting approximately
64% of the electricity power load, there
are conflicts caused by unclear rules
about water governance at federal,
state and basin levels.9
Water management is further
complicated around the world by
economic pressures – developing an
economy can be a thirsty business,
based on unsustainable use of water.
As countries industrialize, more fresh
water is needed for energy production
– the United States allocates about
40% of its fresh water to energy,
Europe over 30% – and the demand
for water for energy and industry
is forecast to increase by 70% by

Climate change will only exacerbate
these challenges. The latest
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) report, in November
2014, reaffirmed that this warming in
the climate system is “unequivocal”
and that human influence is “extremely
likely” to be the dominant cause.
Atmospheric concentrations of three
major greenhouse gases (carbon
dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide) are
at their highest level in 800,000 years,
with CO2 concentration up 13% since
1990. The world today is estimated to
be about 1°C warmer, on average, than
it was in the 1950s, and the effects
are being felt. Regional analysis of the
Global Risks Perception Survey shows
that declining water availability features
as the most likely risk in the Middle
East and North Africa and South Asia,
and the likelihood of extreme weather
events is considered especially high in
North America, South Asia and East
Asia and the Pacific (see Figure 3).
Scientists caution that a total
warming of 2°C implies a high risk of
catastrophic climate change that could
damage human well-being on a global
scale. Yet even if each country meets
The Global Risks Report 2016

13

Part 4

Development (OECD) estimates that 4
billion people could be living in waterscarce areas by 2050. According to
the World Water Council, 80% to 90%
of the scarce water in many of the
world’s arid and semi-arid river basins
is already being used, and over 70%
of the world’s major rivers no longer
reach the sea.7 On the other hand,
inadequate sanitation exposes 2.4
billion people to many diseases, such
as diarrhoeal disease, which is the third
leading cause of death among children
under five.8

Unless current water management
practices change significantly, many
parts of the world will therefore face
growing competition for water between
agriculture, energy, industry, and
cities. Tensions are likely to grow within
countries, especially between rural
and urban areas and between poorer
and richer areas, and also potentially
between jurisdictions. More than 60%
of the world’s transboundary water
basins lack any type of cooperative
management framework. Even where
such frameworks do exist, they often
do not cover all states that use the
basin.13 Interstate tensions over water
access are already apparent in some
parts of South Asia, and could impact
the evolution of the international
security landscape, as discussed in
Part 2.

Part 3

Note: Survey respondents were asked to select up to five risks of highest concern for each time frame. The
percentage indicates the share of respondents who selected the specific global risk among the five risks of highest
concern for each time frame. See Appendix B for more details. To ensure legibility, the names of the global risks are
abbreviated; see Appendix A for the full names and descriptions of the risks.

2030 across Asia.10 Globally, based
on current trends, water demand
is projected to exceed sustainable
supply by 40% in 2030.11 Adding to
the pressures, agricultural production

and a rising demand for meat.12

its Intended Nationally Determined
Contributions plans, submitted to the
United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and
agreed at the Paris Climate Conference
in December 2015 (Box 1.2), warming is
projected to reach 2.7°C by 2100.

Part 3

Given these developments, it will,
therefore, be impossible to live
without adaptation – but adaptation
planning is complicated by the
difficulty of predicting not only the
expected degree of warming but
also the expected pace. One source
of uncertainty is the Arctic feedback
loop – will ice sheets collapse slowly

or rapidly? The average sea level is
already rising by 3 millimetres per
year, faster than any other time in
the last two millennia; many of the
world’s cities lie on the coast or on
river banks, with poor neighbourhoods
most likely to be in low-lying areas
vulnerable to flooding.14 Another
source of uncertainty is the “Amazon
Dieback” scenario: recent oscillation
between unusually dry years and heavy
flooding could be an early indicator of
irreversible system phase change.15 If
the Amazon stops absorbing carbon
and starts releasing the estimated
120 billion tonnes of carbon it holds –
equivalent to 15 years’ worth of 100%

fossil fuel emissions – the impact will be
global.
Failure to address climate change and
water crises will forcibly displace more
people – the IPCC warns that droughts
and coastal floods could cause
“large-scale demographic responses
– for example, through migration”.
Forced displacement is already at an
unprecedented level, causing severe
humanitarian challenges, as explored in
the following section.

Box 1.2: The Paris Agreement: A Historic Turning Point on Climate Change

Part 4

The adoption of the Paris Agreement on 12 December 2015 by 195 governments is a major turning point in the global fight
against climate change. The world’s nations agreed to limit global average temperature rise to “well below 2°C above preindustrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels”. They also agreed to a
review mechanism that will help ratchet up efforts every five years from 2018, as well as a floor for financial flows to developing
countries.
The Paris outcomes are far more ambitious than had been expected – a collective recognition of the dangerous risks posed by
climate change as well as the cost of inaction. These outcomes are also sending unmistakable signals to the global markets that
governments are willing to put aside their differences and do their part in tackling this biggest of global challenges.
In the coming months and years, the impact of the Paris Agreement will be felt in board rooms, banks and stock exchanges
across the world. The expectation is that, as a result, trillions of dollars needed for investments will be unlocked to put the world
onto a climate-safe pathway. The time has come to pivot from business-as-usual.
One of the innovations that emerged from Paris was the official recognition of the role played by business, investors, cities and
provinces in driving and delivering climate action. Effective mobilization of these constituencies – alongside civil society and
faith-based groups – has indeed contributed to this successful outcome. But such mobilization was possible only because an
ever-growing number of global businesses and cities today understand that deepened globalization has heightened
vulnerabilities through global supply chain shocks. And that these disruptions could be further triggered by climate volatility and
policy uncertainty.
To date, nearly 190 governments have submitted their climate action plans, covering over 95% of total global emissions. These
efforts alone will not suffice, as even the most optimistic estimates suggest that these pledges taken together would contain
warming only to 2.7°C above pre-industrial levels. But these bottom-up efforts will provide a solid foundation from which
ambition can be ratcheted up in the coming years.
Developments in the real world will also help, with cost-competitive alternatives already available today. In 2014, renewables
made up over half of total energy investment, while the cost of solar panels has fallen by 75% and that of batteries for electric
vehicles by half since 2009. Wind-generated electricity in over 50 countries is now at grid parity – when the customer of
electricity pays the same to buy wind energy as to buy traditional technologies.
Looking forward, global attention will turn firmly towards implementation and developing specific action plans to deliver a
low-carbon, climate-resilient world. With a clear direction of travel, the immediate next step will focus on policy frameworks and
incentives that will deliver the results, as well as on the consolidation and scaling of much-needed public-private cooperation.
For businesses, the Paris Agreement is a licence not only to implement climate-friendly practices but also to innovate and
develop the next generation of solutions. The race is on for forward-looking businesses and governments alike to capitalize on
these new business opportunities for growth and resilience.

Humanity on the Move

Figure 1.3: Global Displacement Hotspots, 2014

Source: UNHCR 2015b, p. 3.
Note: A “hotspot” is defined as a country or area that has been suffering from conflict-related displacement flows
during the reporting period.

Third, most forced migrants move to
other developing countries, where
social and governance systems may
already be weak or likely to fail (see
Figure 3). In 2014, 86% of refugees
lived in developing countries and about
12% in least-developed countries.
In emerging economies, resource
constraints can be significant: the UN
estimates the cost of housing Syrian
refugees in Jordan to be over 7% of
Jordanian GDP.21
All these factors, if unaddressed,
can fuel risks in host and destination
countries. Although research on the
economic effects of refugee inflows is
limited, it suggests that refugees can
make a positive contribution to the host
country’s economy through increased
demand, inflows of remittances,
promoting the use of technology
and engaging in international trade.22
In advanced, ageing economies,
incoming refugees can contribute to
keeping aggregate demand high and
the workforce stable.
Multistakeholder approaches that
include local business communities
can contribute both to mitigating risks
that could emerge from large-scale
involuntary migration and to building
The Global Risks Report 2016

Part 4

The lack of effective integration policies
in most countries (see Box 1.3 for an
example) can lead to the formation of
ghettos or isolated communities on the
margins of society, ripe for frustration
and vulnerable to disenchantment and
even radicalization. In Europe, the rapid
inflow of migrants in 2015 challenged
local financial and absorption
capacities and exacerbated the trend
towards polarization of societies and
the political spectrum, which in turn
undermined the efficiency of European
governance structures.

The institutional architecture for
refugees focuses on providing a shortterm response to people displaced
by conflict and violence. It assumes
refugees will settle in camps and
primarily need humanitarian assistance,
whereas most now settle in urban
areas20 – where humanitarian actors
have not yet developed well-functioning
operating models – and primarily
need resilience building. Moreover,
the Geneva Convention does not
cover environmental migrants, whose
numbers are expected to rise for
reasons explored above.

Part 3

Global refugee flows have reached a
level that is unprecedented in recent
history. In 2014, 59.5 million people
were forcibly displaced in the world,
compared to 40 million at the time
of World War II.17 More than half of
these recent refugees come from
three conflict-ridden countries: Syria,
Afghanistan and Somalia.18 The trend
is upwards: during 2014, the number
of people displaced – 42,500 per day
– was four times greater than in 2010.
Although the recent crisis in Europe has
dominated headlines, and is reflected in
the risk being considered most likely in
that region (see Figure 3), the challenge
is global with most regions affected
(see Figure 1.3).

The longer people stay away from
their home countries, the harder it is
to return: often they have lost their
livelihoods, family ties and physical
property; furthermore, property rights
issues for returning refugees can be
complex. Protracted refugee situations
become even more difficult when
refugees are granted only limited socioeconomic rights and opportunities,
limiting their scope to reclaim
livelihoods and dignity.

Second, the global humanitarian
architecture is not able to effectively
respond to today’s challenges. Many
countries, including some of Syria’s
neighbours, have either not signed
the Geneva Convention governing the
status of refugees, or do not uphold
it because there is no enforcement
mechanism. Without formal refugee
status, refugees can find it harder to
access formal employment, social
assistance or travel documents.

Part 2

The Global Risks Landscape sees a
noticeable increase in both perceived
likelihood and impact of the risk of
large-scale involuntary migration.16
The definition of this risk includes
forced migration caused not only by
violence and conflicts, such as those
driving the exodus from Syria and Iraq,
but also for environmental or economic
reasons. The risk is seen as more
relevant in the next 18 months than the
next 10 years (see Figure 1.2). However,
it is strongly interconnected with
other risks that are considered highly
worrisome in the longer term: not only
interstate conflict and state collapse but
also climate change and water crises,
as discussed above.

Three factors increase the risks posed
by involuntary migration. First, people
stay in host countries longer than
they used to. The average duration of
displacement lengthened from nine
years in the 1980s to 20 years by the
mid-2000s.19 Fewer than one in 40
conflicts is now resolved within three
years, and more than 80% last for more
than 10 years.

Part 3

resilience in transit countries and
countries of destination. Measures
to consider include work permits
and access to jobs, skills recognition
and training, and access to schools
and public health services. At the
same time, at the global level, the
development community could help
by focusing more strongly on building
resilience and helping refugees to
transition into self-reliance. This will
be even more important in light of the
slow and unstable growth the world
is currently experiencing, which may
further limit countries’ absorptive
capacities.

Economic Growth 4.0
Fiscal crises in key economies, asset
bubbles, and structural unemployment
and underemployment are among
economic risks rated as both highly
impactful and likely; another global
systemic financial crisis is rated as
somewhat less likely than last year,
but similarly impactful. Taken together,
these risks could result in another
economic slowdown with knock-on
effects on employment and, ultimately,
social stability.

Economic concerns are currently
centred on the corporate and public
debts built up by emerging markets
in the recent low-interest rate
environment: the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) estimates the extent of
corporate over-borrowing at up to
US$3 trillion,23 and the corporate debt
to GDP ratio rose by 26 percentage
points between 2004 and 2014 for this
group of countries.24 Particular risks
could emanate from China, where
continued credit-based measures to
address concerns about a slowing
economy could further heighten
vulnerability to a financial crisis.

Box 1.3: Refugees in Malaysia

Part 4

Since the 1980s, hundreds of thousands of Rohingya, a stateless ethnic and religious minority from Myanmar, have sought
asylum in nearby countries, including Bangladesh, Thailand and Malaysia. In recent years, an increasing number of Rohingya
people have fled by boat: 25,000 people departed from the Bay of Bengal just in the first quarter of 2015. Over 50,000 Rohingya
refugees are registered with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Malaysia,1 with thousands more
unregistered. The situation in Malaysia is at once a protracted refugee situation – with multiple generations of refugees, some of
whom have achieved moderate de facto integration – and a humanitarian crisis marked by a steady influx of emaciated and
traumatized asylum-seekers.
The legal status of refugees in Malaysia is tenuous: the country has not ratified key international agreements (most notably the
1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol), and it lacks a legal and administrative framework for responding to refugees.
While the UNHCR has primary responsibility for refugees – including registration and documentation – there are significant gaps
in protection and assistance. Refugees cannot attend Malaysian schools, face barriers accessing healthcare, and confront a
range of security and protection risks, including detention.
Despite these challenges, refugees invariably show a vibrant entrepreneurial spirit, undertaking formal and informal work to
support themselves and their families, at restaurants and retail shops, schools, factories and farms, operating their own small
businesses, cleaning, collecting goods to recycle and working in skilled professions, for instance as electricians. Specific
examples include refugees opening tea shops with the help of Malaysian acquaintances, opening grocery shops that serve as
meeting places for other refugees, and opening home day care for Malaysian children in the neighbourhood. However,
restrictions prohibiting them from undertaking employment legally mean that most resort to difficult jobs for low pay, and their
illegal status leaves them vulnerable to abuse and exploitation.
Rohingya refugees seek to improve their lives and livelihoods over the course of protracted displacement in various ways. They
adopt skills and techniques – such as learning the local language and negotiating with authorities – to help them secure
employment and make their way. Contrary to the widespread perception that refugees are a burden for the country of asylum,
only a small proportion of refugees in Malaysia receive formal assistance from non-governmental organizations or the UNHCR;
instead, most find innovative, albeit challenging, ways to support themselves and their families. They rely primarily on support
from other refugees, community associations, and members of the host population to manage shocks, find work, overcome
bureaucratic barriers and gain access to institutions. In the absence of formal social protection and services, Rohingya refugees
have begun to develop their own: refugee-run community organizations, for example, register members, issue marriage
certificates, operate convalescent shelters and help refugees find work.
Although it is important to recognize what refugees can do for themselves, the livelihoods of even the most successful are
precarious. Many have relevant and transferable skills and a genuine desire to bring something to the communities in which they
live, yet there is a marked dissonance between what refugees stand to contribute and the restrictive policies that limit their ability
to do so. Addressing this gap requires a shift away from seeing refugees as passive victims or recipients of assistance or goods
to understanding them as active agents pursuing lives and livelihoods in an extremely challenging environment, and in doing so
contributing to the countries where they seek asylum.

would accentuate risks associated with
unemployment and the weak fiscal
position of many key economies.

The result could be numerous
corporate and potentially sovereign
defaults in emerging markets,
triggering a financial crisis and further
slowing growth. In turn, slower
growth in emerging economies
could further reduce commodity
prices, exacerbating exchange rate
shifts.26 With declining liquidity in
financial markets in emerging market
economies,27 a crisis in an emerging
market could spark volatility in global
financial markets, leading to a global
economic slowdown (see Box 1.4). This

In developed countries, concerns
remain about debt levels – mainly
public – creating another vulnerability
in the interconnected global
economy. National economic crises
can spark global slowdowns, but
international governance does not have
mechanisms in place to address the
underlying risks, which are under the
purview of national economic policies.
Because any country could be a weak
link, it is critical to strengthen resilience
in all countries.

could undermine the sustainability
of high debt and lead to reversals in
capital flows.

Part 2

Concern is growing over debt levels
at a time when long-term global
economic prospects are expected to
remain weak as a result of a worldwide
slowdown in productivity growth over
the past decade. In the short term,
lower commodity prices and further
appreciation of the dollar could pose
balance sheet risks to both public
and private sectors in countries with a
high share of debt denominated in US
dollars; in emerging markets, dollardenominated corporate debt issued
in 2015 stands at US$120.5 billion in
2015.25 Also plausible is an increase
in risk premiums on investments in
emerging markets, which have been
compressed in recent years. Interest
rates are likely to go up in future, which

Box 1.4: China’s Financial Vulnerabilities and the Transition to the New Normal
Part 4

Because of its sheer size and rapid development, China plays a prominent role in shaping the global economic landscape. The
country is now at a critical juncture as it transitions to a new phase of its economic development – referred to as a “new normal”
by President Xi – in which its economy is based less on investments and exports and more on consumption and services. In the
new normal, the Chinese economy will be more driven by market forces; it is expected to grow more slowly than its recent
annual average of 7%, but more sustainably. However, whether this transition will be orderly is uncertain.
Uncertainty centres on the massive corporate debt built up by traditional industries that drove China’s last two decades of
growth but now face lower demand. The IMF estimates, for instance, that, at the end of 2014, the ratio of total liabilities to equity
in China’s construction sector exceeded 250;1 in the oil and gas sector, the ratio has more than doubled since 2007, albeit from
a lower base.
China’s financial sector is another, related cause for concern. The Chinese banks that fuelled the rapid credit growth in nowdeclining industries consequently face worsening asset quality and non-performing loans. Their profitability has plummeted over
the past year, adding to concerns about the fragility and vulnerability of China’s underdeveloped financial system – which is
dominated by large state banks and casts a large shadow banking sector. The central bank’s intervention in August 2015 to
weaken the renminbi could increase the risks of capital outflows, making funding and liquidity conditions for banks even
tougher. It could also exacerbate the risk of default of Chinese companies that borrowed in foreign currency.
The government faces a dilemma. If it tightens credit conditions, it could reduce investment more quickly than consumption can
increase to compensate, and cause massive defaults among struggling and heavily leveraged companies. This could mean a
much more severe economic slowdown, potentially causing a surge in unemployment and social unrest. However, if the
government lets more credit flow to avoid these destabilizing defaults, it risks further increasing the indebtedness of
underperforming industries and creating bigger problems down the line. The government seems to have opted for letting more
credit flow: in October 2015, the central bank lowered its benchmark rates and relaxed reserve requirements for banks.
The hope is that more of the new liquidity will flow to productive service-based activities and high-end manufacturing that will
yield higher returns and accelerate the transition to the new normal. Mitigating the risks of this further increase in debt, China still
has policy buffers to absorb financial shocks – it has a relatively favourable fiscal situation, including low debt and large foreign
reserves. This allows the central government to be lender of last resort for heavily indebted local governments, state-owned
banks and enterprises; to intervene to stabilize the stock market; or to adopt stimulus plans.
However, overreliance on these buffers could exacerbate existing vulnerabilities and impede the transition process. Instead, the
government should invest in improving the nascent safety net to boost consumption in a country where, on average,
households save about 30% of their disposable income, one of the world’s highest.2

First: cyber-related risks. Cyberattacks
and related incidents have been
entering the global risks landscape
as among the most likely and most
potentially impactful risks for the past
two to three years – in North America,
cyberattacks ranks as the most likely
risk by far (see Figure 3) – with the
potential threat for doing business
explored further in Part 4. Cases
have been rising in both frequency
and scale. They have so far been
isolated, concerning mostly a single
entity or country, but as the Internet
of Things leads to more connections
between people and machines,
cyber dependency – considered by
survey respondents as the third most
important global trend (see Figure
4) – will increase, raising the odds of a
cyberattack with potential cascading
effects across the cyber ecosystem. As
a result, an entity’s risk is increasingly
tied to that of other entities. As cyber

The failure to understand and address
risks related to technology, primarily
the systemic cascading effects of
cyber risks or the breakdown of critical
information infrastructure, could have
far-reaching consequences for national
economies, economic sectors and
global enterprises. By one estimate,

The Internet of Things

Part 4

Many hope that emerging technologies
will fuel a new wave of productivity
and growth. The pace of innovation
is increasing and the spread of
technologies is inevitable,29 giving rise
to individual innovations and disrupting
business models, processes and
products in ways that will require rapid
adaptation.30 A recent study suggests
that internet-related technologies
such as mobile internet, automation
of knowledge work, the Internet of
Things and cloud technology will be the
most disruptive and generate the most
economic benefit (see Figure 1.4).31

Automation of

Part 3

European countries that do not
react appropriately to technological
change could lose 600 billion euros in
value added over the next 10 years,
corresponding to about 10% of
Europe’s industrial base.32 Businesses,
policy-makers and civil society
therefore need to find appropriate
frameworks to address four high-level
risks associated with the transformation
towards a more digitized economy.

Mobile Internet

Part 2

With longer-term trends such as
demographic changes and rising
wealth disparities likely to heighten
economic and social pressure in
emerging economies over the next
10 years, there is renewed urgency
to generate growth. As explored in
the Global Competitiveness Report
2015–2016, productivity – the major
driver of growth – has been declining in
recent years.28

dependence rises, the resulting
interconnectivity and interdependence
can diminish the ability of organizations
to fully protect their entire enterprise.
As more organizations move to digitize
their unique business value within more
connected environments that rely more
and more on machine learning and
automated decision-making, cyber
resilience takes on a new importance.
Although organizations may recognize
the benefit of cyber technologies for
their bottom lines, they may not be
fully internalizing cyber security risks
and making the appropriate level of
investment to enhance operational
risk management and strengthen
organizational resilience. Particular
attention is needed in two areas that
are so far under-protected: mobile
internet and machine-to-machine
connections. It is vital to integrate
physical and cyber management,
strengthen resilience leadership and
organizational and business processes,
and leverage supporting technologies.
Second: the exchange of data between
countries and stakeholders. Data have
been called “the oil of the 21 century”,
and a predictable legal framework is
needed to realize the full economic
potential of digitization. Recent cases of
policy reversal have created uncertainty
about the legal situation, which can
hamper investment and adaptation
of the latest technologies. Given the
inherent international nature of data
flows, in areas such as supply chains
or 3D printing, national governance
needs to be complemented by
a functioning international legal
framework. However, the current
regulatory regime is underdeveloped
and lacks the necessary legal certainty
in areas such as privacy, transparency,
encryption control, the effect of
intellectual property regimes on data
that cross borders, and the impact
of proprietary data on competition.
Given the many actors and industries
involved and the competing interests
at stake, stakeholders will probably
struggle to find common agreement.
Moreover, the physical infrastructure
for data exchange, such as undersea
cables, could also become a target in
international conflict or terrorism.
Third: changes to the work
environment. Although there is a lot
of uncertainty about how many new

Box 1.5: Pathways to Resilience: Effective Leadership and Institutional Values

Part 2

Global risks recognize no geographic boundaries. Whether from natural or man-made or cyber disasters, the cascading effects
can be felt oceans away. Escalating terrorist attacks in Africa, Europe and the Middle East; natural disasters related to climate
change; and health disasters from infectious diseases increasingly impose both economic and human costs. How can the
global community prevent or mitigate the adverse effects of catastrophic events in our increasingly complex and quickly evolving
environment?
The Global Agenda Council (GAC) on Risk and Resilience advocates four key activities for companies, organizations and
governments to build resilience at national and global levels.1 These recommendations resulted from a detailed study of entities
that proved to be resilient in recent disasters, including Nepal’s 2015 earthquake, the 2014 Ebola outbreak and Chile’s 2010
earthquake, along with an assessment of data from four sources including the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the World Bank and the Zurich Insurance Group.

Part 3

1. Clarify roles and responsibilities. During a crisis, it is critical to have clearly delineated and understood senior official and
c-suite executive roles and responsibilities for risk and incident management. Confusion around “who is in charge” or “who has
authority” wastes crucial time and resources, and makes response and recovery less efficient and effective. The need for
well-defined roles becomes heightened when an organization faces novel or rapid-onset disasters or emergencies, such as
those resulting from cyberattacks. Pre-determining, training and exercising roles, capabilities and plans helps to ensure an
organization’s risk readiness. The successful management of complex crises also requires a capacity for adaptability and
flexibility. Crisis managers must be able to adjust pre-established plans as needed given the unique characteristics of the crisis.

Part 4

2. Develop Crisis Leadership Characteristics. Organizations that successfully position for, respond to and recover from
major events also consistently have effective leadership – the qualities and actions of those with authority and influence can
empower their entities to be resilient. Such leaders are steady and decisive in the face of uncertainty and pressure. They make
decisions in a timely and prioritized way, and communicate them transparently. Recognizing that they cannot address risks
alone, they galvanize others and are clear about what assistance they require. They understand when a disaster requires them
to cut through policies that may prevent or delay action. Leaders who are effective during and after a crisis are those who have
earned trust through their demonstration of openness, transparency, responsiveness and accountability. They are seen as
honest and standing up against corruption. For example, an IMF assessment attributes much of Chile’s effective recovery from
the 2010 earthquake to the nation’s “technocratic, rules-based, and transparent” leadership – and to its institutional practices,
including the rule of law.2 Another example is seen in Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg’s speech in the wake of the
July 2011 terrorist attacks in Norway, which demonstrated how leadership during a crisis can significantly result in both
increased trust in government and meet citizens’ expectations of responsiveness. These examples also highlight the role of
meaning making – that is, the capacity for leaders to make sense of an adverse event and articulate to the public a clear path
forward in a state of emergency.
3. Leverage expertise. When confronted with an unprecedented emergency, strategic crisis managers must be able to quickly
identify and mobilize the most relevant and trustworthy expertise to help understand and respond to the crisis. Knowledge
management systems and expert networks need to be set up in advance and across multiple sectoral, professional and
disciplinary boundaries. Understanding the implications of the crisis beyond the immediate consequences and anticipating the
potential pathways of cascading effects requires appropriate crisis management structures that enable additional expertise to
formally support decision-making. For example, the United Kingdom’s Scientific Advisory Group in Emergency (SAGE) is an
independent support group that provides science-based expertise for the management of complex and unprecedented crises
to the UK cabinet. Access to such expert “force-multipliers” could help both public and private entities understand and address
the unique aspects of a crisis. Having access to specialized expertise is especially crucial for novel or multi-faceted evolving
crises – such as the Great East Japan Earthquake, which impacted the Fukushima nuclear reactor and caused many
companies to struggle with what decisions to make.
4. Create a culture of integrated risk management and multistakeholder partnerships. Another necessary institutional
value is the recognition of the scope of global risks and the need for partnerships to address them. A culture of risk
management – the beliefs, norms and values that underpin daily actions – must span the whole organization, including its
supply chains. Entities can no longer afford to have different types of risks managed by different policies and operating
procedures and by different officials, executives and agencies. All parts of an organization must collaborate transparently on risk
management through integrated planning because of the potential for risks to have cascading consequences, including
spillovers between the virtual and physical realms – for example, a flood disabling a server farm, or a cyberattack interrupting
electricity supply.

The Global Risks Report 2016

Part 1
Part 2

Individuals and organizations must recognize the imperative to contribute to resilience and must also know what and how
they can contribute. No single entity – public or private – possesses all of the necessary authority, resources, or expertise to
ensure its resilience against catastrophic events. Instead, resilience necessitates collaborative approaches. Public-private
partnerships that harness the core competencies of each sector have a critical role to play in strengthening resilience capacity
and maximizing the benefits of investment in risk monitoring, business continuity planning, and disaster preparedness.
Instilling a culture of collaboration will enable effective partnerships before, during and after disasters. For example, in
Germany, the LÜKEX Strategic Crisis Management Exercises conducted every two years by the federal government are
designed to address complex crises and their potential disruptive consequences across sectors through cascading effects.
LÜKEX involves a large partnership between the public and the private sectors to build a culture of crisis management and
trust across multistakeholder partnerships.3

“Resilience” is defined as “the ability of a system, community or society exposed to hazards to resist, absorb, accommodate to and recover from the effects of a
hazard in a timely and efficient manner, including through the preservation and restoration of its essential basic structures and functions.” UN Office for Disaster Risk
Reduction (UNISDR) 2009; see http://www.unisdr.org/ we/inform/terminology.

types of jobs new technologies will
create and what they may be, it is likely
that more existing categories of jobs
will be computerized. The US Bureau
of Labor Statistics estimates that, by
2022, 47% of US workers will have a
high probability of their jobs becoming
automated.33 Examples include robots
taking over manual tasks in online
retail stock keeping, healthcare and
diagnostics, and checking in hotel
guests, while knowledge workers in
non-routine cognitive tasks could be
displaced by advances in intelligent
algorithms. The entire employment
system may have to be re-thought
to facilitate transitions between
different types of jobs. Skills in STEM
(science, technology, engineering and
mathematics) are expected to increase
in importance in the medium term, with
longer-term needs projected to focus
on skills such as creativity, problemsolving and social intelligence.34
Fourth: widening wealth, income
and social inequalities. Access to
technology is likely to exacerbate
income differences within and across
countries, with those who adapt
gaining and those who do not losing
income. Four billion of the planet’s 7
billion people still do not have access
to the internet and may not be able to
gain from technology-driven growth.
Currently the distribution of income is
largely determined by employment:
20

The Global Risks Report 2016

advancing technology could diminish
returns to labour and lead to wealth
accumulating in fewer hands.
Excessive inequality lowers aggregate
demand and threatens social stability,
and can increase risks such as
involuntary migration or terrorism
caused by violent extremism. Rising
inequality is also correlated to upticks
in security problems, such as violent
deaths or robbery.35
There is a role for public, private and
civil society organizations in building
resilience to the risks explored in this
part of the Report. In Box 1.5, the World
Economic Forum’s Global Agenda
Council (GAC) on Risk and Resilience
shares the results of research on what
makes organizations resilient.

Conclusions
Every year The Global Risks Report
seeks to remind readers of the varied
interconnections between seemingly
diverse global risks. As well as the
interconnections explored in the
three risk clusters above, each nexus
of risks can also be linked back to
the new status quo of heightened
geopolitical and global security
concerns: environmental stresses
could increasingly see tensions among
countries over access to water and
land; mass forced migration can
be both a symptom and a cause of
cross-border tensions; and emerging
technologies are set to transform
the international security landscape,
alongside many others. The next part
of this Report turns the focus to how
the global security landscape has and
may continue to evolve.

Part 2:
The Security
Outlook 2030

The international security landscape
is in flux, challenging the assumption
of continued social, political and
economic progress that characterized
the first 25 years after the end of
the Cold War. Transformative shifts
in political and economic power
– accelerated by technological
innovation, social fragmentation
and demographic shifts – will have
profound ramifications for the
international security order (see Box 2.1
for the Forum’s definition).

Part 3

Box 2.1: International Security
Defined
“International security” refers to the
measures taken by state or non-state
actors, individually or collectively, to
ensure their survival and integrity
against transboundary threats.

Part 4

The Security Outlook 2030 initiative
was launched by the World Economic
Forum in November 2014 (see Box
2.2). This initiative harnessed foresight
methodology to identify the drivers of
future security landscapes and their
implications. Ten multistakeholder
workshops were held in six different
regions of the world, and interviews
were conducted with security experts
and practioners. The process resulted
in the definition of seven drivers and
three scenarios featured in this Report.

The Security Landscape in
Context
The landscape is characterized by two
main phenomena: first is the vacuum
created by frail or weakening states,
which open up space for the rise of
armed non-state actors in the global
security space and create difficult
spillover crises.1 The rise of wellorganized, armed non-state actors
demonstrates a departure from the
traditional Westphalian notion of the
role of the state. This occurs in two

Box 2.2: A Deep-Dive into International Security

Part 2

Geopolitical uncertainty shows no sign of letting up, with new crises cropping up and protracted conflicts spilling over
throughout 2015. It should come as no surprise, therefore, that geopolitical and international security risks are top of mind for
executives, leaders and the wider World Economic Forum ecosystem. For three years in a row, The Global Risks Report has
registered the growing concerns of leaders over international security: in 2014 and 2015, geopolitical risks shot to the top of the
most likely and impactful risks. More than ever before, understanding geopolitics and international security is central to
mitigating and building resilience to global risks.

Part 3

The Forum therefore initiated a year-long, in-depth study to examine current trends and possible driving forces for the future of
international security. Its purpose was to take a fresh look at how we assess international security risks and ensure greater
preparedness. In parallel with the Global Risks Report project, the Forum convened over 250 constituents who could provide
unique insights on international security–related matters from different angles. The project harnessed foresight methodology to
identify the drivers of future security landscapes and their implications.
As summarized in Box 2.4, the seven driving forces that emerged from this consultation map closely onto the risks and trends
identified as key by the 2015 Global Risks Perception Survey and discussed in Part 1 of this Report. Based on the findings of the
special consultations on international security, this part of The Global Risks Report surveys the current international security
landscape and points out two phenomena – failing states and strategic competition – that are transforming geopolitical and
international security affairs. It also puts forward three scenarios for the international security landscape to 2030.

ways: they position themselves as an
alternative to traditional state-based
governance structures, as a “non-state
state”, and they challenge the state
monopoly of violence.2

of the 1990s and the 2000s were
perceived to be “asymmetrical”, with
technologically inferior but innovative
adversaries challenging government
security forces.

Second is the return of strategic
competition between strong states
with conflicting interests. The two
phenomena may seem contradictory
but are in fact related: when instability
leads to the breakdown of existing
orders, openings are created that
regional or global powers may seek
to exploit to improve their positions.
Likewise, competition between states
may impede effective responses by
global institutions to crises or problems,
which then fester and worsen. Indeed,
the confluence of weak states and
competitive strong states has created
security threats outside the mandates
and capabilities of most international
security arrangements and institutions.
The fragmentation of states was
the principal security concern in the
period after the end of the Cold War.
In contrast to the tense but stable
superpower standoff that ended with
the fall of the Berlin Wall, the conflicts

Although this phenomenon persists,
we are now witnessing the rise of
hybrid conflicts – situations where
both classical and asymmetric threats
coexist and reinforce each other. States
and armed non-state actors learn from
each other. Innovative combinations
of conventional low-tech and novel
high-tech tactics create unpredictable
dynamics. The modern “battlefield”
blurs the distinction between zones of
war and zones of peace, as well as that
between legitimate combatants, nontraditional adversaries and civilians. It
is hard to measure the impact of war,
but conservative estimates suggest
that, in 2014, around 180,000 people
were killed in 42 armed conflicts around
the world3. Indirect deaths and costs
caused by war-related malnutrition,
displacements, trauma, disease and
preventable illnesses raise the toll
even higher. Today more than 6 million
people have been forcibly displaced

Part 4

By drawing out the drivers and risks, the Forum aims to inform discussions among a broad range of stakeholders on the
international security challenges of the future. This dialogue should ultimately be able to bring an agenda to the institutions
empowered to take measures to defuse existing and emerging conflicts, and help to identify shared interests, build confidence
and drive policy on a global scale.

by war and related distress, and the
numbers keep growing.4 Deaths from
terrorism are also on the rise; in 2014
alone more than 32,000 people were
killed in terrorist attacks in 93
countries.5 The indirect costs of both
trends, not only the human cost, are
significant.
In some parts of the world, states
themselves direct violence against
citizens, or support terrorist activities
abroad, in order to attain and promote
their own security objectives. In these
cases the state becomes the driver of
insecurity, rather than the guarantor of
peace and stability, leading to a further
erosion of trust and confidence of
citizens, violations of human rights, and
increased pressure on neighbouring
states who may be forced to absorb
refugees or – either explicitly or
inadvertently – find themselves
harbouring insurgent groups.
The competition for influence between
great powers of today resembles the
Cold War period, but with important
differences.6 Today’s world is more
multilayered than multipolar: states are

under pressure not just from outside,
challenged by their own citizens, as
discussed in Part 3 of this Report.
Leaders may consequently delay
dealing with risks emerging from
the reconfiguration of international
relations, and ideology is no longer a
primary driving force. Strong, weakwilled states are challenged by smaller,
strong-willed players, shifting the
traditional notions of balance of power.
The current geopolitical and
international security context, as
demonstrated in this Report, makes
clear that chronic and resurgent
violence, conflicts, and economic and
social volatility will remain prominent
features of the current and future
reality. The rising flows of people on the
move as a result of greater insecurities
represent only one of the symptoms of
a deep-rooted and protracted systemic
governance crisis, underlining the
need for a transformative shift in how
international affairs are managed.
With each passing year, it also
becomes clearer that many actors
are no longer aligned to a status
quo defined by a selective United
Nations (UN) Security Council. The
assumption that shared values are
a necessary basis for regional or
multilateral arrangements may give way
to alliances and arrangements defined
by shared interests. With dwindling
institutions of global governance, there
is a growing role for public-private
collaboration to tackle global security
challenges (see Box 2.3).

The Global Risks Report 2016

A Tour of the Current International
Security Landscape
The phenomena shaping the
international security landscape are
well illustrated by the challenge of
Daesh, or the self-proclaimed Islamic
State in Syria (ISIS). Although the
territory it controls lies in Syria and
Iraq, Daesh has recruited fighters
from over 100 countries – partly
through advanced marketing using
popular social media platforms.7 In its
recruitment strategy, Daesh exploits
the resentment and disillusionment
of young people, offering jihadism as
an exciting anti-establishment cause.
It also has local roots – including, it is
assumed, some forces of Saddam
Hussein’s regime demobilized after
the 2003 invasion of Iraq as well as
individual wealthy regional sponsors.
Many countries are engaged in the
fight against Daesh: recent terrorist
attacks from Ankara to Beirut, Tunis
and Paris, with copycat attacks in other
far corners, illustrate how the battlefield
has become globalized. There are no
simple ways to defeat Daesh. It will not
be defeated as long as civil war rages
in Syria – and civil war will continue to
rage in Syria for as long as the powers
that could end it disagree about
what the endgame should be. Daesh
is banking on the inability of major
regional and global powers to set aside
their differences and pragmatically
find a political settlement that all
would prefer to the status quo. So far,
despite laudable recent attempts to
build a common front, this calculation
of diplomatic inefficacy seems wellfounded.
Military solutions, however, can go
only so far.8 Aerial bombardment
without a coherent strategy for longterm stability may merely extend the
vacuum in which terrorist groups
can thrive. Daesh also needs to be
suffocated socially and economically.
And to prevent it – or something like
it – appearing again in another guise,
its appeal to significant numbers of
young men and women all over the
world needs to be understood and
undermined.9
In the meantime, the situation in
Afghanistan and its neighbourhood is
regressing as security and territorial

gains made by US-led coalition forces
over the past decade have been lost
to resurgent Taliban and al-Qaeda
fighters.
The spillovers from weakening states
are affecting other regions. Violent and
extremist groups are also at work in
parts of the Sahel, northern Nigeria, the
Horn of Africa, the African Great Lakes
area and the Central African Republic.
At the time of writing, other countries
too are facing political tensions leading
to violence. Burundi faces worrisome
political tensions, which raises the risk
of further severe civil unrest and interethnic violence. Elsewhere in Africa,
economic growth continues despite
serious security and social problems.
Properly managing the demographic
youth bulge in Africa will be critical for
security outcomes, implying major
investments in skills building and job
creation.
Latin America likewise faces
governance challenges, with organized
criminal gangs gaining influence over
many aspects of society in various
countries, as a steady stream of drugs
continue to flow from the region into
the United States, Europe and Africa.
Latin America is at a crossroads.10
The combination of slower growth
prospects, increasing social unrest
and political instability combined with
high levels of violent crime pose serious
security challenges for the region.
Several processes are underway in
order to foster a region-wide security
dialogue and establish cooperation
mechanisms to address growing
criminality, violence and insecurity.11
Strategic competition between states
is raising the stakes. In the South and
East China Seas, territorial disputes are
far from resolved. Growing economic
interdependence in a region lacking
commensurate security architectures
increases anxieties about the region’s
ability to peacefully manage a potential
misstep or overreach by one of the
players. The key question here is how
the region – and the wider world –
relates to China’s rise, and indeed how
China itself adapts its own policies
as it emerges into one of the primary
centres of political and economic
might. A major transformation is
underway in China’s armed forces,
emphasizing expeditionary, air,

Part 1

Box 2.3: Public-Private Collaboration in Complex Crises

New models of public-private collaboration need to be promoted to support,
finance and deliver immediate assistance and alleviate long-term needs, with
business collaborating closely with frontline responders on responsible investment
to strengthen state and societal resilience.

As illustrated by its new security
legislation and the long-standing
debate about revising Article 9 of its
constitution, thus allowing for a larger
military role abroad, Japan’s security
posture is evolving, potentially allowing
for a more assertive Japan in regional
and international security frameworks.
India, while currently occupied with
pressing domestic issues of internal
conflict and social inequality, is also a
key actor to watch as the Asian security
landscape adapts to a post-Western
world.
Europe has remained united over
the Ukraine crisis, despite initially
struggling to deploy sanctions
against Russia because of its strong
links in energy and finance. An ever
bigger challenge is presented by
the refugee crisis, a clear testament
to the loss of state control and the

frailty of intergovernmental structures.
Insularity, xenophobia and right-wing
populism are gaining ground across
the continent, calling into question the
integration process and a common
European front on international security
policies. If Europe proves unable to
find common solutions to today’s
pressing challenges, we might see
a de-integration process unravelling
achievements such as the Schengen
passport-free zone, the common
currency, or even the Single Market.
While still unlikely to happen, such a
process could hardly be expected to
be harmonious and peaceful.
Meanwhile, the role of the United
States in international security remains
a source of uncertainty and contention.
Many question whether or not the
United States has the will and the
means to remain the world´s dominant
superpower, and whether or not it can
uphold a Western, liberal agenda for
the entire international system. Recent
attempts to design an American foreign
policy based on alliances, norms and
international cooperation rather than
unilateralism cannot be secured by
the United States alone but require
that other key actors also engage in
upholding international order. The role
played by the US Congress in how
the United States is perceived on the
world stage and the growing domestic
polarization weakens the predictability
of the country as a global actor – which

Trust is waning in the capacity of
existing multilateral mechanisms
to resolve potential flashpoints. In
their current form, global institutions
such as the UN retain their relevance
as meeting places, but they do
not necessarily have the capacity
and credibility to effectively uphold
peace and security. The UN was
designed for a very different world.
The UN-centric intergovernmental
“contract” needs a significant overhaul
if it is to successfully mitigate the
challenges and threats currently facing
international security.
The Geo-Economics of International
Security
International economic relations,
international security and geopolitics
are closely related. When relations
between states are harmonious, trade
and investment patterns are typically
driven by economic considerations.
However, in times of tense relations
between states, politics may trump
economics – for instance, through
the introduction of sanctions against
adversaries or preferable treatment for
political allies.
The Global Risks Report 2016

maritime and space technologies over
its traditional emphasis on the Army
and the defence of the home turf.
The further development of a security
mitigation apparatus that has its core
in the Association of South-East Asian
Nations (ASEAN), but which has an
even broader reach through its regional
cooperative framework, is of particular
importance. For instance, the evolving
ASEAN Code of Conduct for maritime
disputes, while not attempting to solve
the underlying competing claims, is an
attempt to avoid escalation into conflict.

Part 3

The lines between conflict and non-conflict zones are increasingly blurred, with
pockets of vulnerability coexisting with pockets of progress. The lines are also
blurred between criminal, inter-communal and politically motivated violence. More
refugees and internally displaced persons are forced to flee for longer periods of
time. Conflicts, mismanaged migration, poor governance and corruption are
eroding gains from economic growth and development, affecting both low- and
middle-income countries.

As an energy power, and possessing
the world’s second largest arsenal
of nuclear weapons, Russia will
continue to play an assertive role
in the geopolitical order. Following
the annexation of Crimea, there is
no clear political solution in sight to
the continuing tensions in eastern
Ukraine. EU-US sanctions combined
with the low price of oil have hurt
Russia’s economy, but have so far
not achieved the desired policy shift.
Other great powers’ desire to contain
Russia collides with the desire for
cooperation against the threat of
Daesh. Russia’s future hangs in the
balance between modernization and
reliance on raw materials exports, with
the current leadership increasingly
looking East for politico-economic ties.
Western countries, having reduced
their investments in defence and being
preoccupied with internal concerns,
may find that they lack the resources
and will to implement their long-term
strategic objectives.12

Part 2

We have entered a new era, and it is not a peaceful one. Emerging conflicts and
long-term violence are seriously impacting people, social fabrics and political
systems. There has been a rise in de-structured conflicts and violence – often
fought in densely populated urban areas – and international humanitarian law is
repeatedly and systematically violated.

risks causing discord between the
United States and the rest of the world,
its allies included.

Part 1
Part 2
Part 3

After decades of rapid globalization, the
current geopolitical landscape shows
some signs of returning to politics
dominating economics. The economic
growth spurred by globalization has
shifted the balance of economic power,
leading to renewed great power rivalry
and global insecurities. New alliances
are playing out in trade agreements,
strategic infrastructure projects, new
investment banks, and arrangements
governing the internet and crossborder data flows and storage –
increasingly a source of tension, as
seen with the annulment of the Safe
Harbour Act agreement.13

Part 4

Economic policies are increasingly
“weaponized”, and not only through
sanctions. Tools that were taken for
granted in the era of globalization
– such as access to raw materials
and technology underlying financial
transactions – may become politically
restricted, posing new risks for
industries that rely on free and open
markets for access to technology,
materials and customers. Businesses
may find more and more obstructions
as a result of anxieties around trade,
technology transfer and intellectual
property, calling into question the
reliability of global supply chains,
industrial partnerships and crossholdings.14
Civil wars and terrorism can disturb
the flow of goods and services, with
the interconnectedness of the global
economy magnifying the impact.
Ninety percent of traded goods travel
by sea, often through stretches of water
in Asia and Africa that are increasingly
part of territorial disputes or targets
of piracy: the Suez Canal, the Strait of
Malacca, the Gulf of Guinea and the
Strait of Hormuz – thoroughfares for
trade, energy transport and supplies –
are all surrounded by violent
conflicts.15 Air transport costs are
increasing because of heightened
travel security procedures and the
need to avoid overflying conflict
areas. As discussed in Part 3 of this
Report, epidemics can also threaten
international security, with the recent
Ebola crisis a reminder of potential
vulnerabilities.

Driving Forces and
Amplifiers
The Forum’s year-long consultations
on international security identified
seven key driving forces of change in
the international security landscape
(see Box 2.4). They are highly
interconnected, each interacting with
and affecting the others. From the
seven, two stand out as warranting
more detailed discussion: technological
innovation and natural resources and
climate management. They are not
only drivers in their own right, but also
significant amplifiers of the others.
Technological Innovation and
International Security
From longbows to gunpowder, nuclear
weapons, airplanes and drones, the
history of international security is also
the history of technological innovation,16
and the history of humanity is defined
by war, and war by the people
who fight it and how they fight it.17
The Fourth Industrial Revolution
will profoundly affect our security,
physically and virtually. Previous
industrial revolutions have advanced
human development but they also
precipitated violent transfers of power.
Technological innovation will continue
to influence how conflicts arise, who
fights them, where they are fought and
how they are settled.
Some ways in which new technologies
will impact international security in
the coming 15 years can already be
anticipated: for example, improved
capacity to 3D-print weapons from
digital templates and new possibilities
for biological and chemical weapons.
However, technologies are fusing
in increasingly unpredictable ways,
and potential nefarious uses are
not always immediately apparent.
Even if they were, innovation quickly
outpaces the capacity for regulatory
oversight. Breakthroughs in a range
of technologies – from robotics to
nanotechnology, artificial intelligence,
genome sequencing, human
advancements or meta materials –
could destabilize security and shift
balances of power.
Until recently, the ability to inflict largescale damage required either armies

28

The Global Risks Report 2016

of people or sophisticated equipment,
such as nuclear weapons, effectively
available only to states. With the Fourth
Industrial Revolution,18 large-scale
damage is possible for small groups
and even individuals working from
home computers or labs. Existing tools
to prevent the escalation of disputes –
treaties, conventions, or doctrines such
as “mutually assured destruction” – are
of questionable use when destructive
capacity is no longer limited to a
handful of entities with broadly similar
resources, tactics and interests in
preventing escalation.
The internet has opened a new frontier
in warfare: everything is networked and
anything networked can be
hacked.19 The “dark net” has become a
trading place fuelling insecurity. Every
future conflict will have a cyber element,
and some may be fought entirely
in cyberspace. Given that attack is
easier than defence in cyberspace,
this will dramatically change how the
entire security apparatus prepares for
potential breaches. Physical distance
no longer offers protection; many
technologies are dual-use; much
critical infrastructure is privately owned;
and attacks are easy to disguise given
the challenges of attribution. Social
media is already a significant tool in
hybrid warfare,20 offering a new means
for all sides to a conflict to conduct
cy-ops and psy-ops,21 including scare
tactics, recruitment and fundraising.22
The seabed and space are both also
likely to become increasingly militarized,
as more and more actors – state
and commercial – have gained the
ability to send up satellites or mobilize
unmanned underwater vehicles
capable of disrupting fibre-optic
cables and satellite traffic. Off-the-shelf
quadcopter drones are already being
used by gangs to spy on and attack
rivals. Autonomous weapons, capable
of identifying targets and deciding to
open fire without human intervention,
will become increasingly feasible,
challenging the laws of war.

including energy, water and food.
Efficient governance: Corruption and lack of transparency or rule of law limits the progress of development and destabilizes

Geo-strategic competition: Shifts in economic and political power and weakened mutual trust lead great powers to compete
for influence, often creating competing spheres of influence.

Demographic shifts: Countries may struggle with bulges of youth or elderly populations, or with rapid influxes of migrants.
Social cohesion and trust: Fuelled by inequality, feelings of social exclusion, mistrust and marginalization threaten social
stability.

interconnected world.

with poverty, fragility and ineffective
governance.

Climate change is expected to amplify
existing security problems and create
new ones. As explored in Part 1, the
world will increasingly feel its effects:
extreme weather events including
prolonged high temperatures and
droughts, freak storms and floods, and
rising sea levels threatening coastal
cities and island countries are expected
to occur more frequently and at greater
scale, touching many countries,
especially those already grappling

The likely impact of climate change
on food security, explored in depth in
Part 3, is another channel of impact on
the international security landscape.
As wells dry up, crops and fisheries
fail, and people lose their livelihoods,
simmering tensions between social
groups are more likely to boil over into
community violence. Armed non-state
actors, including insurgencies and
terrorist groups, will be able to leverage
this new source of insecurity as an

additional grievance on which to build
their narratives, finding new recruits
among those made destitute.
Stresses on water and food could
contribute to rising tensions among
states. Trade may be interrupted by
the hoarding of commodities, local
populations can object to foreign
control of arable land, and arguments
may erupt over rights to draw water
from rivers and aquifers that cross
borders.

Part 3

Box 2.5: Scenarios Methodology
What are the most pressing issues leaders should address? What trends are driving transformations? To be as prepared as
possible for the future, leaders need to think broadly and consider the worst that could happen.

Part 4

Strategic foresight enables assessments of what the future context might look like through carefully researched and validated
scenarios. Scenarios extrapolate existing trends to provide insights that can inform more robust decision-making. The three
scenarios presented here (Figure 2.5.1) describe how the seven driving forces of international security could interact and how
prominent actors might respond. The collaborative process of developing and using scenarios can generate the relationships
necessary to drive change.
During a year-long initiative, launched at the Annual Meeting in 2015,1 over 250 members of the World Economic Forum’s
network participated in consultations to build the scenarios. To ensure a broad perspective, our team conducted 10 workshops
in six regions, with participants from government, the security sector, academia, civil society, youth, and the business sector,
which together comprised 41% of the total number of participants (see Figure in the Acknowledgements section). A full list of

Part 1

Future 1: Walled Cities
As greater penetration of information
and communications technology
broadens the horizons of citizens in
many countries, raising expectations
in areas such as health, education,
infrastructure and quality of
governance. At the same time, fiscal
challenges are reducing governments’
ability to meet citizens’ expectations
– and citizens become disillusioned
by their exposure to public sector
corruption, poor service delivery and
ineffective institutions.
This scenario foresees widening
inequalities of wealth, income,
health, environment and opportunity
continuing to pull communities apart.
In wealthier nations, the middle classes
are hollowed out by declining wages
and dwindling public goods. Those
who can afford it are increasingly
retreating to gated communities and
turning to the private sector for what
were once public services, divorcing
their interests from the common
good.23 Fertile soil, fresh water and

Social cohesion is further weakened
by mass migration, as youth seek
economic opportunities and
humanitarian or environmental
catastrophes displace people. In the
absence of narratives that foster a
shared identity and common cause,
mismanaged migration flows and poor
integration of migrant communities
create tensions. Anxiety over migration
fuels the rise of extremist, xenophobic
and ethno-nationalist political
parties that advocate for a return of
authoritarian government and national
identities based on culture, ethnicity or
religion, effectively exploiting narratives
of “us” vs. “them”.
As younger populations spend more
of their lives online, they fill the need
for shared narratives and a sense of
community with like-minded people,
sometimes in faraway geographies.
Meanwhile, millions of children are
coming of age in refugee camps,
often under duress, and with no
natural sense of belonging. Rootless
and disillusioned, often traumatized
by growing up amid civil wars or
community violence, more young
people become anti-system and
vulnerable to recruitment by violent
groups or gangs.
Insurgencies, terrorist groups, and
criminal organizations all exploit
the security deficit, leveraging new
technologies to strengthen their hands

In some areas, lines between states
and violent non-state actors blur.
Terrorist or criminal groups, often in
opaque alliances, seize control of more
territories and run them like states,
threatening nations and even regions
with collapse. The corridor between
South America and Mexico, Iraq and
the Levant, and swathes of West and
Central Africa are among the areas now
under pressure from combinations of
civil wars, humanitarian crises, violent
extremist activity, crime and gangs.
More and more frequently, legitimate
non-state actors and organizations fill
some of the spaces left by weakened
national governments, often with
social support. Companies and private
charities fill the void and manage what
were once public services. With their
operations located near desperate
communities, many companies are
drawn into addressing the social
consequences of insecurity and
violence. Eroding state power also
increases city power, with cities coming
to be regarded as the most practical,
functional unit of governance.24
The world divides into islands of
order in a sea of disorder. As large
numbers of people are displaced
by environmental change and
social violence, still-functioning
states seek to protect themselves,
often deploying private military and
intelligence apparatus to minimize risks
of involvement in protracted conflict.
In this scenario, by 2030 the world
resembles medieval times, when the
citizens of thriving cities built walls
around them to protect themselves
from the lawless chaos outside.
Future 2: Strong Regions
An alternative scenario envisages the
volatile and competitive interregnum
paving the way for the emergence of a
stable world by 2030 with several seats
of power.

Part 4

The potential for rapid and radical
change, even though the form it
takes is unknown, raises fundamental
questions about planning and
preparedness. In this section, three
scenarios describe potential evolutions
of the international security landscape
to 2030 (see Box 2.5 for a description
of the methodology used). These are
not intended to be predictions, but
plausible trajectories that can usefully
challenge current thinking and serve as
a call to action for the development of
more adaptable and resilient response
systems.

The vitality of many states is challenged
by demographic trends. In some
regions, large youth populations come
of age with few opportunities for stable,
well-paid employment. In other regions,
the demographic bulge is of the elderly,
creating ever greater needs for finance
for pensions and healthcare; this puts
pressure on declining working-age
populations and limits the resources
available for states to address security
issues.

against strained security forces.
Overwhelmed by internal threats,
states double down on internal
security issues and disengage from
multilateral collaboration, reducing the
effectiveness of global institutions and
mechanisms.

Part 3

Security Outlook 2030:
Three Alternative
Scenarios

even clean air become increasingly
commoditized and traded between
those who can afford them. With
economic and political elites feeling
ever more identical and distant from
citizens, states lose their ability to
bring people together around a shared
narrative or identity. Trust is eroded, as
is the social contract between citizens
and government.

Part 2

Interstate tensions are also likely to be
stoked by an increase in migration into
countries less affected by the changing
climate. Environmental stresses will
accelerate migration across borders
and also to cities, putting additional
stress on urban infrastructure in many
countries. Cities will need to find new
tools and policies to manage security
risks.

Part 1
Part 2

In this future, as wealth accumulates
in the South and East, more players
are able to make strategic economic
investments in diplomacy, critical
technologies and infrastructures. The
balance of power adjusts, creating a
new order of mostly regionally based
spheres of influence and interests
that are generally accepted, as are
newly evolved norms of engagement
over political disputes and shared
resources.

Part 3
Part 4

Far from their power being eroded,
states in this world are strong – at
times authoritarian. Strong leaders rise
to power on promises to refocus on
narrowly defined national interests, with
minimum diversity and high solidarity
for citizens. Narratives recalling
(imagined) past glories and comforting
homogeneity of ethnicity and creed
become a strategy to compensate
for the uncertainty of the future. As
in the 1930s, leaders persuade their
citizens to “escape from freedom”:
these leaders strictly control borders,
forcefully curb migration, invest more
in military and police, and persuade
people to accept mass surveillance
as the only way to be protected from
deadly threats.
Overwhelmed by mistrust among
states, governments invest their
political, financial and diplomatic capital
in bilateral and regional processes.
Effective regional powers emerge,
as do new alliances of convenience
where shared interests transcend
the regional perimeter. Global
governance mechanisms continue
to lose credibility. New forms of
cooperation initially run in parallel with
the established global architecture,
gradually taking over roles including
development, trade, finance, security
and the internet. Counterintuitively, this
proves to reduce competition between
states: with contentious issues taken
off the global table, states are able
to rebuild enough trust to maintain
stability at the international level.
For example, in this world cyberspace
is neither open nor global. States
establish further controls over the
internet, sometimes in collaboration
with allies, building their own
capabilities in data storage, search,
and infrastructure – and using security
threats and the promise of better
32

The Global Risks Report 2016

public services through big data to
win popular support.25 Climate change
is another example: as its effects
become clearer, states increasingly
shift attention from cumbersome global
efforts to more functional regional
ones. The goal of saving all humanity
from catastrophic climate change gives
way to states and regions working
together to adapt and protect “their
own” citizens.
With bad memories of recent foreign
interventions and increasing domestic
polarization over foreign affairs, the
United States refocuses its priorities
and abandons its ambition to be the
centre of the global stage, allowing
others to fill the void on major political
issues. China’s “peaceful rising” no
longer raises apprehensions among
other powers; its prominence in East
Asia becomes an accepted fact.
ASEAN goes into a comfortable orbit
around its giant neighbour, while
Japan focuses on maintaining good
trade relations. The United States and
China mutually accept their economic
relevance and shared roles and
responsibilities in a new world order.
Sweeping aside any last resistance,
Russia consolidates its sphere of
influence in Central Europe and
Eurasia. Europe – having rebuilt its
economic partnership with Russia
and consolidated links with the United
States – develops several levels of
integration and remains functional as
a coherent regional trade bloc. Latin
America and the Caribbean leverage
their abundant resources and strategic
location to consolidate into a regional
bloc. The push for African integration
continues apace, with two subregional integration blocs emerging
as twin poles of influence. Following
years of fruitless proxy conflicts in the
Middle East and North Africa, two
carefully balanced security alliances of
functioning states restore some degree
of order to the region.
Fifteen years into the future, this
balance of regions and alliances is
only beginning to consolidate as a new
global order. Former rivals and enemies
are tempted to test the boundaries,
leading to strong pushbacks and
reconfirmations from regional powers
that the new order is here to stay.
Security issues are handled by regional

allies or relevant players, rather than at
the global level.
Inevitably, there are losses for the
global economy: geopolitical interests
take predominance over economic
ones, with corresponding inefficiencies
as globalization goes into reverse.
However, with the revolution in
manufacturing and automation making
it possible to produce goods closer to
the consumer, there is less need for
global trade in goods and less need
to outsource production to low-wage
countries. Companies must make
costly and complex arrangements to
be able to operate across regions; in
many cases, abandoning international
strategies, localizing or breaking up into
smaller regional entities, prove to be
more effective strategies.
Future 3: War and Peace
The final scenario envisages the world
drifting into a major conflict during the
next 15 years, which ultimately leads to
a reworking of the global system.
In this future, established powers
remain in denial about the major
shifts of economic, demographic and
political power that have taken place.
Growing strategic competition between
states erodes their trust in each
other, and therefore their capacity to
collaboratively resolve disagreements
about the role of certain countries in
certain regions: for example, the United
States in the Asia-Pacific; Russia in
Central Asia; and China in South-East
Asia.
Meaningful progress slows on issues
such as climate change, with global
solutions blocked by states that
calculate that taking action would
be too problematic domestically, or
that they could gain from new lands
becoming suitable for crop production
or resource exploitation. There is no
longer consensus over the normative
foundations or rules of the international
system, which is not able to manage
the rising tensions.
With stagnant growth and the rise of
isolationist movements in established
powers, space opens up for emerging
powers to test the status quo.
Meanwhile, internal pressures grow

Part 1

Ultimately, the conflict stops short
of all-out mutual destruction, but
not before imposing high costs on
both sides – human, economic, and
infrastructure. The “nuclear taboo”
– that states abstain from using the
ultimate weapons, even if they possess
them, still proves to hold true – but
belligerents did begin to prepare for
their application. There is no clear
victor. In this scenario, the aftermath
of the conflict leads to a sense of
determination to prevent a repeat
interruption to business as usual. The
commonly accepted argument is
that the lesson to be learned from the
failure of previous global mechanisms
to mediate conflicts is that those
mechanisms were not only excessively
ambitious but also largely ineffective.
States set about identifying the
few basic practicalities that truly
demand global cooperation: norms,
for example, relating to the seas,
air corridors, and finance. Because
of their economic relevance, many

Implications and
Outcomes
Though none of the three scenarios
presented here will occur exactly as
described, the security landscape
of the future may manifest multiple
elements from one or more of the
scenarios, probably simultaneously.
Indeed, it can be argued that we have
already entered the period of “walled
cities”, as the refugee crisis seems to
lead some nations to the reflex reaction
of closing borders – both physical and
political – as described in Part 1.
The three scenarios may come across
as somewhat dystopian, because they
are extrapolations of existing, negative
trends. The world does not need to
arrive at these dystopias, however. Our
collective knowledge, connectedness,
technological advances and
social innovations present endless
opportunities to change the outcome
and shape a more secure world,
given strong leadership and the
right decisions being taken at the
international level. This last point brings

Overhauling the Social Contract
Above all, these three scenarios point
to the need to overhaul the social
contract between citizen and state.
Re-establishing trust in governance,
improving the accountability of
institutions and leaders, reducing
social and economic divergences and
delivering better services should be
top objectives for policy-makers. In
these areas,26 technology is not only
a potential disruptor but also a key
enabler.
More effective governance alone may
not suffice, however, without also
building greater social cohesion. The
fabric that binds citizens to the state
and to each other is fraying. A critical
task for the state is to reinforce notions
of citizenship and narratives of inclusion
within national discourse, which can
pave the way for reconciling political
and theological differences both
domestically and internationally.
Rewiring Global Governance
All three scenarios reflect uncertainty
around the future role and ability of
global governance institutions to
deliver on security. In an ideal world,
a strong global body would have the
tools and standing to mitigate conflicts
involving either terrorism or competition
between great powers, and to contain
and resolve peripheral conflicts. At
present, however, the multilateral
system appears overwhelmed by the
number and complexity of issues, and
international mechanisms are often
fragmented, co-opted or undermined
by the special interests of chosen
member states.
If states want to strengthen their ability
to take collective decisions on key
international security matters, they
need to improve the efficiency of the
multilateral apparatus. Progress on
meaningful reform of the United Nations
and the Bretton Woods Institutions to
reflect current political and economic
The Global Risks Report 2016

Part 4

Other states are dragged into the
escalating conflict and forced to
choose sides. Armed non-state actors
on both sides seek to leverage the
conflict for their own ends, forcing the
parties to the war not only to fight each
other, but also to engage in hybrid
conflicts against third parties.

The result is a stripped-down global
system in which the liberal ideals of
freedom, democracy, justice and
equality are no longer put forward as
a paradigm to which all should aspire.
A new entente emerges on respect for
differences of political and economic
approach, though this means
accepting a degree of entrenched
global inequality and disintegration,
and a parcelling up of the global
commons. Where they can, people and
companies move to places that suit
their objectives best.

us back to the purpose of this Report:
to cast new light on decisions that need
to be taken today. The following set of
recommendations is intended to aid in
envisaging possible futures and to help
change control the trajectory we are on
and improve the outcome.

Part 3

Eventually, in this scenario, a major
conflict erupts between two leading
powers. One state experiences
a massive cyberattack on critical
infrastructure, causing loss of life. It
accuses another state of complicity,
and launches a conventional attack in
retaliation. Denying any involvement,
the second state considers it has been
attacked without cause. Outraged
populations on both sides demand
further action; nervous leaders
seek to shore up their positions
and miscalculate the gravity of the
consequences.

of these norms are looked after by
multistakeholder organizations, rather
than intergovernmental organizations.
Civil society and business leaders
take on management roles in global
arrangements. Other areas previously
of interest to global governance
institutions, from human rights and free
trade to international development and
control of the internet, are set aside
as non-essential to the basic aim of
preventing conflicts. The UN nominally
retains a peacekeeping function in
protracted conflicts, but is not able
to regulate relations between leading
states.

in many countries: to varying extents,
social turmoil erupts as emerging

of governments. In some countries,
upheavals feed into virulent nationalism,
drawing on historical grievances
against powerful neighbours.

Part 1
Part 2

realities has been slow and unfocused.
Piecemeal reform of the system itself
will not suffice: the choice is between
implementing comprehensive reform
to create the right mechanisms and
responses for future global cooperation
on security, and allowing the “death
by a thousand cuts” of the global
governance system – an outcome that
would not favour international security.
Fostering Global Leadership

Part 3

Today’s world is in clear need of
strong leadership, new compromises,
innovative ideas and a capacity for
long-term thinking. This is not limited
to government and international
organizations but also applies to
civil society and the business sector.
Because power is distributed among
many sectors, multistakeholder
cooperation is more important for
tomorrow’s security than ever before.

Part 4

The digital revolution, at times a
source of disruption, can also be a
tool for enhanced transparency – and
transparency, if genuine, offers the
potential to rebuild trust.
As suggested by the “strong regions”
scenario, beginning that process at a
regional level, with new architectures
that are parallel to the existing
international system, could ultimately
strengthen rather than undermine
global stability.
Enhancing the Role of Cities
Refocusing some security efforts at
the level of the city could be another
contribution. As urbanization gathers
pace, cities will increasingly rival states
as the most natural level of government
for harnessing technology to deliver
public services and security. Cities
have also proven their advantages
as sites of innovation, employment
creation and higher productivity,
because they, at times, prove to be
more focused on practical problem
solving than on the “status and
prestige” issues that tend to obscure
interstate relations. Devolving resources
from national to municipal levels and
creating new ways for city leaders
to collaborate on security matters
may also be faster than reforming
established mechanisms for multilateral
collaboration among states.
34

The Global Risks Report 2016

Promoting Private Sector
Engagement
A strong argument could be made
for increasing the participation of the
private sector as a stakeholder in
international security.27 The implications
of security risks affect companies
assessing where to invest and do
business as much as they affect
governments engaged in trade,
diplomacy and maintaining the security
of their citizens. Yet the potential of
the private sector to contribute to
peace and security is not reflected in
global security mechanisms or at the
multilateral level.
Businesses often see global security
as a risk management and compliance
issue. Limited understanding of
one’s own global, regional and local
impact might sometimes even lead to
inadvertently reproducing or confirming
negative patterns in society and
governance. The traditional business
response to geopolitical skirmishes
has been to view them essentially as
intractable externalities: companies
seek to minimize downside risks
while waiting for a crisis to blow
over. However, in a hyperconnected
world, volatility in one place can have
immediate repercussions on the other
side of the globe. Avoiding investment
in known or potentially volatile places
does not insulate companies from the
impacts of volatility. In today’s world,
companies might be well advised
to understand their own potential to
influence international developments.
Many companies are already
dealing with the root causes of
insecurity, directly or indirectly. From
inefficient governance to corruption,
environmental degradation, social
disparity and unrest in surrounding
communities, many companies
have policies in place to protect their
interests while also addressing these
drivers of insecurity within their core
areas of operations. For example, a
mining company seeking to minimize
environmental impacts on local
communities, a telecommunications
company training local workers in
the skills they require and thereby
also empowering those workers, and
an infrastructure company working
with local government to improve
quality and transparency around

public tenders may all be contributing
towards addressing the drivers of
geopolitical instability. Another way
the private sector can contribute is
through company norms that forbid
involvement with corrupt practices; this
may, over time, spur better governance
and reduce social resentment.
Encouraging New Behaviour
Multistakeholder cooperation might
also be conducive to mitigating the
security implications of technological
innovation. Ethical frameworks and
norms guiding technological innovation
could be elaborated between those
actually involved rather than relying only
on regulators, which will struggle to
keep up with the pace of change in the
Fourth Industrial Revolution. Likewise,
common understandings about the
security dimension of an increasingly
connected world could involve key
private and public stakeholders from
both the emerging technology and
international security spheres.
Viewing climate change through
an international security lens also
suggests several policy options
where multistakeholder action is
critical. These include the search
for new mechanisms to reflect
externalities related to resource
scarcity or environmental effects, while
simultaneously safeguarding social
stability by guaranteeing affordable
access to the necessities for survival.
Public-private partnerships established
to identify technological solutions to
improve the efficiency and resilience
of food production and water use is
another example.

Conclusion: A Call for a
Resilience Imperative
If the “new status quo” implies such
a high presence of global geopolitical
risks and realignment around interests
rather than values, then a wider range
of stakeholders needs to be involved in
setting the direction of the new global
security paradigm and implementing
solutions.
A first step is for private sector leaders
to place international security firmly on
their radar screen. International security
and geopolitical trends are likely to have

Part 1

more influence on the global economy
in the future, thus demanding greater
strategic attention from business
leaders. With a stronger understanding
of the issues and their own evolving role
in the geopolitical and global security
landscape, the private sector can be
a constructive partner in addressing
many global security challenges and
mitigating their driving forces.

Endnotes

A second step is to have the traditional
security actors – including international
organizations and governments –
adjust their own frameworks and
processes to build in more publicprivate participation at the most
appropriate levels. The Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative, action
taken by technological and social
media companies to block terrorist
and violent extremist activity, and
business alliances for action on climate
change are promising examples of
public-private arrangements that can
strengthen security.

Part 4

Rather than wait for crises to happen,
or sleepwalk into the dystopian
scenarios described above, it is
critical to identify potential inflection
points and focus on finding solutions
rather than just containing problems,
and adapt relevant structures
accordingly. Prompting greater pliability
through a genuine, forward-looking
multistakeholder process in order
to ensure against complacency and
improve the outcomes in a fast-paced
and interconnected world may be the
best way to prevent the described
dystopian futures from materializing.

“Non-state actors” is a term widely used to describe everything from non-for-profit
or commercial providers, non-governmental organizations across all thematics,
community-based organizations and faith-based organizations. Their characteristics
include sufficient power to shape and cause change, although they are not part
of the established institutions of a state and are thus not accountable to the same
standards as a state. In the global security context, however, the term is often used
to refer to violent, criminal, terrorist and militarized groups or individuals with no ties
to a state or state-like structures but who, through the use of asymmetric strategies
of warfare, declare war on states and state actors. Non-state actors can also be
a force of good in terms of their significant role and emphasis on a specific area of
focus, usually on common goods, for the advancement and promotion of issues.

Part 2

Third, a renewed focus on prevention,
preparedness and resilience, rather
than reaction and compliance, would
likely improve security actors’ ability to
manage known and unknown security
risks. There exists important know-how
and resources in the private sector
that can improve preparedness and
mission-critical planning processes in
a global security context – using data
to track the progress of risk factors,
sharing information on where and
when crimes occur, and establishing
mechanisms for harnessing industry
supply chains during complex
emergencies – are a few examples of
how security arrangements could be
updated.

Hybrid threats and warfare refers to the blend of conventional, irregular means
of combat and asymmetric tools, often with a strong cyber element, in military
strategies facing indistinct adversaries and aggressors in a complex battle domain,
complicating matters such as attribution and retribution.
21

The term “cy-ops” refers to militarized cyber operations; “psy-ops” refers to
military operations usually aimed at influencing the adversary mindset through
noncombative means.

Part 3:
Risks in Focus

Part 3

The previous sections of this Report
have explored the ways in which global
risks are becoming more imminent,
impacting more people’s lives,
economies and institutions. This part
of the Report explores the Global Risks
Landscape 2016 and the Global Risks
Interconnections Map 2016 through a
societal lens. Because well-functioning
societies are at the core of international
security and are key to strengthening
resilience, this section presents an
in-depth exploration of three distinct
angles that relate to societies: the three
Risks in Focus. To motivate action,
each of the Risks in Focus includes
examples of practical initiatives that can
be implemented to build resilience.

Part 4

One of the key risks related to the
advancing digitization of societies
concerns the tension between
the ways in which technology is
empowering citizens and the growing
sense of political disempowerment
felt by many of those citizens. Rising
income disparity and a shortage of
quality employment opportunities –
that could be further exacerbated by
the Fourth Industrial Revolution – along
with extreme weather events and
heightened migration flows are among
the factors that could leave societies
deeply unsettled.
Against this background, the first Risk
in Focus introduces the concept of
the “(dis)empowered citizen” and
discusses potential consequences for
social stability. The second contribution
explores food security – a necessary
condition for social stability – which is
increasingly under threat from failure
to mitigate and adapt to climate
change; this Risk in Focus builds on
the findings of Part 1. Finally, the third
Risk in Focus discusses the potential
of future pandemics to threaten social
cohesion.
The world has navigated previous eras
of profound transitions resulting from
converging economic, technological
and geopolitical developments. But
with a faster pace of change and more
complex interconnections, the stakes
have never been higher.

3.1 (Dis)Empowered Citizen

World Protest Intensity

Many societies try to channel the
stress associated with societal
transformations into constructive
dialogue, enabling those affected to be
and feel heard by their fellow citizens
and those in authority. Common
mechanisms for individuals to raise
public awareness of issues and ask for
change include organizing or signing
petitions, donating to or joining social
or political groups, and standing for
election.

Social stability is being challenged by
multiple and profound transformations
that affect most countries worldwide.
These transformations result from
fast-paced technological progress,
globalization, wealth and income
concentration, shifting demographics,
lack of job opportunities and a
changing climate. Together they
are creating new opportunities,
expectations and sources of frustration.
Social instability is not per se always
a negative factor, because it can
drive towards another and potentially
better new equilibrium. Ensuring
that these transformations result in

However, not all societies have
constructive mechanisms in place to
handle appeals for change. Faced with
disquiet over societal transformations,
some respond by closing down
debate, deliberately or inadvertently
stifling individuals and groups that
question existing structures. To some
extent, social stability is in the eye of
the beholder: in some societies, a
peaceful mass demonstration would
be regarded as threatening, subversive

Part 4

Although statistics related to social
instability vary – particularly because
the terminology used to describe
instability fluctuates widely – data
suggest there has been a rise in
protests over the past two decades.
As illustrated in Figure 3.1.1, protest
intensity has reached a new and
higher plateau since the most recent

Part 3

Social instability has re-emerged in
recent years as a prominent concern.
As discussed in Part 1, social instability
is again the most interconnected
global risk (see Figure 2), ranking in
the top 10 over both 18-month and
10-year time horizons (number 5 on
the 10-year time horizon; see Figure
1.1 and number 8 on the 18-month
horizon, not displayed). Profound social
instability additionally ranks among the
three most likely global risks to occur in

spike, associated with the 2011 Arab
Spring. The Global Database of Events,
Language, and Tone (GDELT) Project
notes “elevated protest activity of the
last three years” in comparison to the
previous “two decades of relatively
reduced protest action.”1 Its data
suggest we are again approaching
1980s protest levels, when causes of
social turmoil ranged from Cold War
tensions and anti-apartheid sentiment
to the Tiananmen Square protests.

regarded as an example of constructive
change mechanisms working as they
should.

Part 4

It is not clashing attitudes per se
that cause social instability – there
will always be citizens demanding
change. Rather, social instability can
emerge when transforming attitudes
come up against institutions that
are unsuccessful in their struggle to
peacefully incorporate them into the
broader social and political context.
Around the world, trust in institutions is
plummeting. The most recent edition
of the Edelman Trust Barometer found
that in a higher proportion of the
surveyed countries than ever before in
the barometer’s 15 year history, people
were distrustful of both governments
and businesses. Even NGOs are not
immune – although they still command
more trust than the public or private
sector, the 2015 Edelman Trust study
showed a declining sense of trust in
those entities, too.2
Social Stability at Risk
The global risk of social instability
is heightened by uncertainty about
whether existing structures will be able
to constructively resolve pressures
when (dis)empowered citizens’

Box 3.1.1: The (Dis)
Empowered Citizen: A
Definition
The term “(dis)empowered citizen”
describes the dynamic that is
emerging from the interplay of two
trends: one empowering, one
disempowering. Individuals feel
empowered by changes in
technology that make it easier for
them to gather information,
communicate and organize. At the
same time, individuals, civil society
groups, social movements and local
communities feel increasingly
excluded from meaningful
participation in traditional decisionmaking processes and
disempowered in terms of their ability
to influence and be heard by
institutions and sources of power.

The Global Risks Report 2016

demands threaten to undermine a
country’s political stability (see Box
3.1.1 for a definition of (dis)empowered
citizen). With more (dis)empowered
citizens organizing and mobilizing,
governments and businesses alike
need to come to terms with the ways
in which they may be exacerbating
the root causes of citizen discontent.
They must understand the risks and
work out how to adjust to a changing
operating environment and a new
societal landscape.

models consequently need to adapt
to new demands and expectations.
Increasingly customers want to know
not only about a business’s own
performance in areas such as child
labour and environmental impact, but
also about the operations of its entire
supply chain. They expect to have a
voice in all aspects of its operations,
from how production processes are set
up to how distribution operations are
developed and investment decisions
around community initiatives are taken.

Beyond economic uncertainty,
the risks for countries include:
(1) undermined legitimacy of the
government mandate; (2) increased
social polarization; (3) political impasse
and the impossibility of actuating
reforms, where relevant; and –
under more severe circumstances
– (4) possible disintegration of a
country’s governmental system and
other cascading risks that might
easily emerge in a truly globalized,
interconnected and complex world.
An inclusive society with empowered
societal actors who are aligned behind
a joint vision for the country is a
strong signal that a state is stable and
confident, with greater transparency,
lower corruption and a stronger rule
of law – all important factors for doing
business.3

Drivers of (Dis)Empowerment

From an economic perspective,
businesses benefit from a stable
social and political environment for
running their operations. They operate
according to forecasts and scenarios
that factor in socio-political risks, and
instability increases their operational
costs, reduces margins on investments
and undermines local networks.
Social and political unrest can cause
losses in revenue, property damage,
roadblocks, bureaucratic delays,
overall economic slowdown and an
unconducive business environment.
For businesses, more specific risks
include (1) reputational risk and other
dangers to brands; (2) potential loss of
market share; (3) product boycotts; and
(4) disruption of established business
models.
Particular risks to businesses may arise
when local contexts and relationships
change when people feel unable to
effect change as citizens and look for
ways to do so as consumers. Business

Social structures around the world
are being transformed on three levels.
First, at the individual level there are
changes in how people feel and how
they perceive the world and identify
with particular values; this is combined
with people’s increased ability to
express and transmit their views, which
in turn influences behaviour. Second,
at a collective level, rapid changes in
how social groups form and solidify
have taken place, and in how these
groups debate and develop common
values and viewpoints and how they
interact with other stakeholders. Third,
often driven by and in response to the
individual and collective levels, formal
institutions such as governments,
businesses, religious institutions, the
media and civil society organizations
are also changing the way they relate
to and interact with both groups and
individuals.
These evolving structural forces create
new patterns of communication,
relationships, collaboration and
expectations, which in turn – in
combination with emerging
technological, economic, political
and environmental drivers – create
new structures of empowerment and
disempowerment.
Economic Drivers
Many countries have recently seen
mobilizations against inequality,
persistent unemployment and
deteriorating economic environments.
From the Arab Spring to the antiausterity protests in Europe,
people have vocally rejected the
consequences of what they perceive as
a distorted and non-inclusive economic
and political system. Demands for
reforms to tackle corruption, in both

Part 1

The perceived inability of governments
to respond to major global challenges
– from climate change and internet
governance to food security – is
eroding confidence in authorities.
Combined with a sense of diminishing
separation between the private and
public sectors, governments are

Technological Drivers
Technology amplifies dissatisfaction
caused by other drivers. Social
movements are facilitated by digital
tools that allow the individual citizen to
be heard and also allow rapid mass
mobilization, cyber-activism and
globally connected social movements
that span traditional geographic and
political boundaries (see Box 3.1.2).

Rather than looking for ways to win
back public trust, however, many
governments have eroded that trust
further by responding harshly to
protests: closing down space for civil
society, demonizing protestors and
harassing activists. In recent years, the
space available for citizens’ actions
has shrunk in many countries. The
CIVICUS Civil Society Watch Report
shows that core civil society freedoms
of expression, association and peaceful
assembly were violated to a significant
degree in at least 96 countries during
2014.11

While voter participation rates are
steadily declining, especially among the
young, digital technology is providing
new ways for people to mobilize and
challenge existing power structures to
articulate an alternative. This was most
visible in the 2011 wave of youth-led
revolts from North Africa to South
America, but there is general evidence
of an increase of citizens’ movements
worldwide in the past couple of
decades. Studies of online content
dating from 2010 and 2012 indicate a
positive relationship between political
content and youth who were previously
politically disengaged.8
Online protests, strikes, cyber activism,
and online petitioning and boycott
campaigns are increasing. For
example, the online activist and petition
network Avaaz.org grew by around
40 million members in eight years,
and Change.org now has 80 million
users. Although some cynicism exists
around “clicktivism”, which can be seen
as merely a form of virtue signalling,
such web-based activist organizations
have often complemented online
activism with offline activities,9 thereby
amplifying their impact. As the world
becomes more connected, mobile and
networked, protests that might once
have been geographically limited can
spread ever more widely and quickly.

Clear arguments can be made
for governments to oppose some
citizen movements, such as those
that disregard human rights.10 In
most cases, however, many different
perspectives on what constitutes the
social good can be valid. To establish
trust and ensure broadly sustainable
development, a country’s businesses,
citizens and government need jointly
to elaborate a common viable national
vision.

Technology is empowering
governments as much as citizens,
notably to employ surveillance tools on
their own populations – and sometimes
those of other countries. In some
cases, governments breach their own
laws, as with the British intelligence
agency spying on international NGOs
outside of proper procedures.12
Increasingly laws are being reformed
to legitimize data collection and cyber
oversight, such as Canada’s Bill C-51,
which originally called for removing
barriers to sharing security-related
information.
Just as protestors are learning
tactics from one another, antiprotest legislation is often inspired
by experiences in other countries.
A growing number of governments
have implemented similar measures
imposing limits on peaceful assembly
and protest, narrowing the definition
of what is considered permissible civil
society and media activity, banning civil
society organizations from receiving
foreign funds for certain activities, and
making new registration inordinately
complex. CIVICUS has drawn attention
to the shrinking space for civil society

Political Drivers
The last three years have seen more
elections and government collapses
in major market economies than in
all of the previous decade.4 Approval
ratings of political leaders are sagging,
and established political parties
across Europe are facing declines in
membership and a need to reconsider
how they engage with the electorate.5
Labour unions are not doing any
better: although increasing in Asia
and South America, membership has
been declining in Europe and North
America, particularly in the United
States, where the unionized workforce
hit a 97-year low in 2013.6 A proliferation
of alternative political parties – some
of them extremist or nationalist – has
challenged established governance
systems without necessarily delivering
the outcomes hoped for by citizens
in terms of improved transparency
and equality. Indeed, a high turnover
of governments or strong separatist
movements can end up making policymaking less stable and worsen distrust
in governance structures.

Repressive Reactions Fuel Social
Disruption

Part 3

Environmental Drivers
Changes in society, regulatory policies
and business practices are crucial to
address our changing climate. In recent
years a “climate justice” movement has
emerged from frustration with a lack
of leadership, evident in international
negotiations characterized by long
talks, vested interests and the ultimate
incapacity to curb the effects of global
warming, despite progress at the
COP21. Continued sluggish progress
or a lack of any progress at all will
increasingly fuel protests, especially
as extreme weather patterns make a
progressively greater impact.

perceived to be either unable or
unwilling to regulate the activities
of large corporations, for example
by closing tax loopholes. Political
leadership is seen to be colluding
with, or even interchangeable with,
business leadership, as “revolving
door” practices shape the relationship
between business and government.
Citizens’ view that their own voices
are being ignored by political leaders
is exacerbated – even apparently
validated – by the perception that the
wealthy enjoy privileged access to
decision-makers.7

Part 2

politics and business, are being heard
across the globe. Policies that neglect
or deepen inequality can exacerbate
the combination of less sustainable
economic growth, weakened social
cohesion, and citizens feeling
disenfranchised from democratic
processes.

Part 1

Box 3.1.2: Digital Government Technologies: The (Persisting) Challenges of Inclusiveness and
Engagement
Part 2

The ability to leverage technology to improve relationships between governments and citizens depends on citizens being able to
use that technology. In OECD countries in 2012, for instance, less than a quarter of people aged 65–74 said they interacted
electronically (internet portals, social media) with their government, compared to more than half among the 16–24 age group on
average across the OECD (Figure 3.1.2.1). To fully exploit the potential of digital technologies, governments should take steps to
address existing digital divides and avoid the emergence of new forms of e-exclusion. As well as age, gaps persist in the level of
uptake by education level and living area.

Part 3

The two main reasons for e-exclusion are lack of physical access and limited technological skills. Therefore, alongside the
development of a well-functioning digital government infrastructure, a crucial component of an effective digital government
strategy is action to increase the population’s ICT literacy, raise awareness of existing online opportunities and boost the
comfort and familiarity of all age groups with the use of digital channels to interact with governments. A multi-channel approach
to service delivery, providing services by various offline (e.g. in-person contact, postal mail) and online means (e.g. websites,
mobile-based applications) in an integrated way, is more likely to guarantee access to public services to all citizens.

Governments can take further steps to use digital channels to foster engagement through the full policy-making cycle. Most
governments still view social media as an additional tool to broadcast traditional communication messages. According to a
recent OECD survey, fewer than one in four governments try to leverage social media for more advanced purposes such as
transforming public service delivery or opening up public policy processes to key stakeholders.1 The 2014 OECD’s
Recommendation of the Council on Digital Government Strategies provides principles for governments to harness new
technologies to increase openness, transparency and inclusiveness of processes and operations, and to foster greater citizen
engagement and empowerment. Government bodies need to identify and support businesses and citizens who can form a
digital government ecosystem that promotes dialogue and exchange.
One important development has been the use of Open Government Data to make public data sets available to citizens to
enable more informed engagement, greater social accountability of government, and opportunities to create public value by
putting information into the hands of citizens. The OECD OUR Data Index assesses governments’ efforts to implement open
data in three critical areas – openness, usefulness and re-usability of government data.2

Part 1

A range of innovative responses
by governments, businesses and
civil society organizations can build
resilience to the risk of social instability.
Just as new technologies are playing
a role in driving the risk, so can they
also be used to mitigate it, minimizing
the frustration of individuals and
groups by creating a transparent and
inclusive enabling environment with
responsive forms of governance.
This section presents innovative and
emerging developments that can be
taken by three different stakeholders:
governments, businesses and civil
society.

In many cases, the repression of
citizen movements reflects a profound
uncertainty among governments and
businesses about how to deal with the
questioning of established societal,
economic and political structures.
Leaders may be unsure of what
policies to implement, or they may
be constrained by internal challenges
from implementing changes in a timely
manner; either situation can result in
doing nothing – a response of hoping
that protests will pass.17 However, any
kind of failure to respond adequately
to citizens’ demands merely adds to
their sense of disenfranchisement from
traditional change-making methods.
As the rise of technology enables
citizens to harness new connections
and form communities that
transcend geographical limits, a
socially destabilizing vicious circle
could become entrenched: growing
expressions of anger are met with
increasingly harsh responses by
governments, which in turn further fuel
citizens’ feelings of disenfranchisement
and discontent.

First, governments have the
opportunity to re-empower citizens
politically, opening up space for
dialogue and participation, embracing
transparency and accountability,
and looking to enlist citizens as
collaborators in public service.18
Bland “participation washing”
approaches – described as the
attitude of listening to requests but
not actively addressing them – are
not enough to truly contribute to more
stable societies. Technology-based
innovations could offer options to
modernize public service management
and delivery, as happened in the
small Spanish town of Jun, which
increasingly administers its municipal
services and communicates with
citizens through Twitter.19 Equally
importantly, the creation of a trustbased space for multistakeholder
partnerships represents a building
block for effectively managing
risks (see Innovative Response
1) and successfully achieving
good governance and inclusive
development.20 The effectiveness
of such approaches depends on
successfully tackling e-exclusion (see
Box 3.1.2).
Second, businesses have opportunities
to win trust, build resilience and
minimize the risk of disruption
by committing to transparency,
responsibility and higher standards
along their supply chains in areas such
as worker rights and environmental
sustainability, and by collaborating with
citizens in new ways.

Third, civil society has the opportunity
to find ways to leverage new
technologies and collaboration models
to strengthen social fabric; improve
services and shared spaces; make
socio-economic frameworks more
cohesive and inclusive; and improve
the ways in which stakeholders interact,
deliberate and act.
A source of inspiration for engaging
and empowering citizens could be the
“citizen science” movement, in which
scientists have found ways to use
digital technologies to engage citizens
in scientific research activity. Popular
platforms, such as Zooniverse,23
are taking science out of labs and
integrating hundreds of thousands
of knowledgeable volunteers in
collaborative, people-powered
research. Citizen science gives
participants a sense of belonging to
an effort that creates positive, lasting
change – it combines advancing
scientific knowledge with educating
citizens, raising awareness of issues,
and encouraging wider participation
in democratic debates about how
science-related policy-making is done
(see Innovative Response 3).
The Global Risks Report 2016

Part 4

In combination with surveillance
practices, such measures are creating
a growing sense of limitation on
citizens’ freedom of speech and
freedom of assembly. The Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace
reported that, in 2014, 50 countries
placed restrictions on overseas funding
for NGOs.13 The Committee to Protect
Journalists has recorded a disturbing
number of restrictions of press freedom
in many countries.14 The combination
of large commercial interests and weak
governance can give rise to businesses
being perceived as complicit in
government repression of civil society
– a perception fuelled by action against
organizations and activists protesting
against the activities of such large
industries as construction, extractives
or agribusiness.15 In Cambodia, for
example, the government has been
criticized for arresting and imprisoning
campaigners against widespread land
grabs that see subsistence farmers
evicted from the land they farm to make
way for large-scale industrial farms.16

Under pressure to deliver more
proactively and effectively on corporate
social responsibility (CSR), businesses
are going beyond traditional and
often-criticized CSR models to
look for economic opportunities
in socially and environmentally
conscious business models based
on innovative and people-centred
partnership approaches (see Innovative
Response 2). An example of the recent
emergence of Hybrid Value Chain (HVC)
models, representing a complete shift
in the way businesses and civil society
interact,21 is the Viste Tu Casa (Dress
Your Home) programme in Colombia:
an established tile manufacturer
worked with the cofounder of a
human rights organization to create
employment for women and reach
new clients by raising awareness of
the hygiene benefits of tiling kitchens.22
By leveraging the core assets of civil
society organizations and businesses,
HVC partnerships generate risk
resilience and new revenue sources
for businesses, improve the livelihoods
of low-income populations and help
to meet the basic human needs of
populations with which civil society
works.

Fundamental demands are being
expressed by people around the world,
both as citizens and as consumers.
Their hopes and expectations can
potentially lead to improvements in
governance and corporate systems,
creating momentum to adapt new
practices, norms and government
policy. When other stakeholders listen,
citizens can be enlisted to co-create the
future they desire. That is the promise
of the empowered citizen – but it is a
promise that can be met only when the
rate of transformation and innovation
in government, business and civil
society structures matches the rate of
transformation in society itself.

Part 4

Three Innovative
Responses to Encourage
Inclusive and Stable
Societies
When people mobilize and social
stability is threatened, resilience
becomes critical. In a world facing huge
challenges, it is imperative to ensure
that institutions, communities and
individuals are prepared and able to
respond to unexpected disturbances.
The relationship between citizens,
governments and businesses needs to
be designed to create a more inclusive
and stable environment.
While recognizing that much more can
be done in this space, the following
pages explore three types of innovative
response aimed at creating more
transparent and open societies: reempowering individuals, introducing
citizen-centric business innovations
and paving the way for critical
grassroots activism. These responses
intend to provide a source of inspiration
for pioneering and original ways to
promote social inclusion and ensure
stable societies.
1. Innovative Finance for Social
Outcomes
As governments struggle to reconcile
budgetary pressures with increased
social demands, innovative models of
collaboration have been put in place
to tackle major societal challenges.

44

The Global Risks Report 2016

The recent rise in impact investing
and social impact bonds (SIBs)
sees businesses and governments
partnering to address pressing issues
that prevent citizens from enjoying
stable, equal and diverse societies.

November 2015, the UK government
expanded its commitment to SIBs
by announcing an allocation of
£105 million for new SIBs aimed at
enhancing financial support for locally
designed schemes.28

The SIBs funding concept is a type
of “pay for success” model where
financiers invest capital in public
projects, usually aimed at measurable
improvements in social outcomes
for at-risk individuals, with the goal of
reducing government spending in the
long term.24 SIBs create a coalition of
actors willing to share the investment
risk to deliver projects that address
social and environmental problems that
might otherwise generate significant
risks for companies, governments and
individuals.

Positive quantitative results for the
Peterborough pilot, which generated
global attention for the SIB model,
affirm that private investment in critical
social service programmes can be an
effective way not only for a vulnerable
population to receive services but
also for investors to diversify their
investment portfolio to make financial
as well as social returns.

SIBs have been particularly useful
for pioneering new approaches to
persistent and costly social ills. From
partnering vulnerable young people
with toddlers to mentor as a way
to address youth unemployment
through personal empowerment to
tackling homelessness by providing
accommodation,25 employment
and medical support, SIBs have
fundamentally shifted how social
service programmes are structured,
impacting both governmental
authorities and non-profit organizations
operating in the social sector.
Inspirational stories abound, with the
£5 million Peterborough SIB in the
United Kingdom in particular heralded
as an example of fruitful public-private
financial collaboration.26 Launched in
2010, the United Kingdom’s first SIB
was designed to reduce reoffending
among short-sentence male prisoners.
Private investors face the upfront
investment costs – and associated
risks – of providing a not-for-profit
organization with capital to carry out
interventions. They are paid back a
financial return by the government if
social outcomes are improved based
on some standard measurement;
recently released evaluation results
indicate that investors are on track
to receive returns in 2016.27 The
Peterborough project – as is often
the case for pilots – has gone
through alternate phases of progress
and hindrance, while overall being
recognized as a key test for opening
the way to the SIBs market to come. In

SIBs hold substantial potential for
many developing and emerging
markets around the world. In India,
an empowering girls programme
is currently being piloted in 200
schools.29 In Mozambique, the malaria
performance bond has been designed
to increase funding for malaria
interventions over 10 years and protect
up to 8 million people from infection.30
Several states in Latin America are
experimenting in this area: for example,
the Mexican state of Jalisco has been
working on the design of a programme
to move single mothers out of poverty,
while Brazilian states such as Minas
Gerais and Cearà are exploring SIBs
to address prison reform and improve
school completion rates.31 The
Israel Arab Workforce Development
SIB, currently in the development
stage, aims to increase employment
opportunities for Arab citizens of Israel,
who are expected to represent 20% of
the state’s population by 2020.32
Many private sector investors, however,
still believe that SIBs entail too much
risk for too little potential pay out. With
this in mind, incentivized crowdfunding
has been emerging as an option for the
next generation of SIBs. Crowdfunding
platforms such as Ethex, MicroGenius,
Abundance and Trillionfund already
have the technical profile and access to
investors to facilitate the crowdfunding
process and engage citizens in impact
investing.33
By involving people more directly
in funding social investments, this
crowdfunded SIBs model has an
even greater chance of revamping
public service delivery structures
towards more effective and responsive

Part 1

2. Citizens beyond Consumers:
Business Innovations for Social
Change

The apparel retailer Patagonia is an
example. The company has reinforced
its brand identity and image with a
well-received campaign encouraging
consumers to repair more frequently.34
By trading the risk that customers
might buy a bit less of their product,
Patagonia is betting on gaining a
bigger market share by attracting
values-oriented buyers who want to
shop at values-driven companies. By
asking people to keep products longer,
the company has made manifest its
values and involved customers in the
achievement (and watchdogging) of its
own sustainability goals.
Similarly, the US-based Recyclebank
is paving the way for environmental
behaviour change. By recycling, its
4.4 million members in the United
States and the United Kingdom can
earn discounts from over 3,000 major

With the growth of smart technology
and social media, behaviour-changefocused business models will
become more mainstream. These
models represent a new approach
for businesses and citizens that
encourages dialogue and interaction
and that strengthens a relationship
based on collaboration, trust and
transparency. By serving customers
and engaging citizens – as individuals
with specific values, ambitions and
aspirations, regardless of their age,
geography, education, income or social
status – businesses can potentially
build their brands while simultaneously
creating positive social impact.
3. Novel Ways to Engage Citizens:
Putting Them in Charge through
Science

For small and medium-sized
enterprises, in particular, another
emerging opportunity to win business
by contributing to more cohesive
and sustainable societies is offered
by community currencies such as
the Bristol Pound in Bristol, United
Kingdom;36 the TradeQoin in the
Netherlands;37 and Berkshares in
Massachusetts, United States.38 The
motivation behind such currencies is
typically to encourage citizens to spend
locally and to reward them when they
do, thereby strengthening the local
economy by making it more diverse
and resilient.

In recent years, “citizen science” has
been gaining attention as a way to
engage citizens in scientific activity,
with endeavours ranging from air
pollution assessments in Europe to
chimpanzee counting in Tanzania. The
proliferation of digital technologies
has provided scientists with innovative
ways to engage the wider public in
science and expand resources for
research. Similarly, it has provided
citizens with new venues for developing
online collaborative projects aimed at
collecting quantitative analytical data to
improve transparency and outcomes in
public decision-making mechanisms.

An estimated 250 community
currencies are available at the global
level, from Kenya and Brazil to Japan,
with more to come.39 For local small
and medium-sized enterprises, active
participation in community currencies
represents an opportunity to stay
relevant through changing consumer
markets and to demonstrate solidarity
with local authorities and citizens’
organizations, which are typically the
driving forces in their establishment.

A great many aspects of daily life
are amenable to a citizen science
approach because science and data
impacts everything from the food we
eat to the policies we try to influence.
Although many of the highest-profile
citizen science projects are limited to
“crowdsourcing” – that is, to citizen
participation in data gathering or
monitoring exercises led by scientists
– citizen engagement occurs on an
ascending scale (see Figure 3.1.2). In
recent years a number of “extreme
citizen science” initiatives have
emerged in which citizens take the lead
in pursuing locally important goals by
asking research questions, collecting
and analysing data and using them to
influence policy-making.40

Although local currencies are a less
obvious fit for major consumer brands,
it is possible to imagine incentives for
environmentally conscious behaviour
being offered to consumers in the form
of local currency rather than discounts
– thereby associating the brand not
only with ecological issues but also

The Global Risks Report 2016

Part 4

Technology is increasingly making
it possible to combine these ideas,
which enables companies to provide
incentives for individual customers
to perform actions that benefit the
community or environment. This is
a way for individual businesses to
profit by improving brand image and
enhancing customer loyalty, while
at the same time contributing to
community or environmental resilience
and engaging consumers in their own
sustainability policies. These win-win
situations lead to more accountable
and transparent practices.

Increasingly, it will be possible to move
beyond education, individual actions
and pledges and to use the Internet of
Things to reward verified behaviours. It
is possible to imagine citizens signing
up to have data collected by their
appliances and utility companies.
These data would be shared with
consumer brands prepared to offer
rewards for eco-friendly behaviour
such as using less water, turning the
thermostat down or switching off lights
in unused rooms. Sensors could be
fitted to a household’s cycles and cars,
and rewards offered when data show
that the bicycle, not the car, is being
used during rush-hour periods.

with attempts to strengthen local
communities.

Part 3

Companies have developed many
ways to give individual customers
incentives to be loyal to their brands,
such as reward cards or money-off
coupons for repeat purchases. Many
companies also see value in spending
to position their brands as socially or
ecologically conscious, for example by
supporting community development
projects.

consumer brands. Sensor technology
on recycling containers and trucks
enables the company to track how
much recycling households are putting
out for curb-side collection, and reward
community members accordingly.35

Part 2

approaches – citizens who invest in
the initiatives gain an incentive to raise
public support for them, and volunteer
their time to help them succeed.
Rigorous, increasingly crowdfunded
SIBs could transform government,
putting people in charge for the benefit
of citizens and society.

Part 1
Part 2
Part 3

Citizen science is more than just
a new outlet that engages publicspirited citizens who have an existing
interest in science. It is increasingly
seen as a tool that could enable
a more participatory democracy
by empowering individuals and
communities to analyse, understand
and ultimately take ownership of the
issues that affect them, enabling them
to propose concrete and actionable
solutions to decision-makers.41 Citizen
science projects have the potential to
keep public authorities accountable,
influence the way they spend public
funding, and inform them about
community priorities and needs.

Part 4

“Factivism” – evidence-based
activism42 – can come in many
forms. Recently, an open research
investigation of the New South
Wales pecuniary interests register
for the 2013–2014 fiscal year has
forced political figures to correct their
disclosures of interests to the Australian
parliament and thereby comply with
current regulation, which requires the
declaration of all directorships and
shareholdings.43 In Iceland, a group
of enthused citizen scientists parsed
a huge database of documents and
sentences to investigate for bias by

assessing a potential link between the
way judges vote and how often they
incarcerate.44 The analysis showed
that a particular judge suspected for
bias with his conviction rate of 95%
was instead within the statistical
norm vis-à-vis all other colleagues
of the Reykjavik district court. Other
examples include crowd-reading of
published oil contracts to promote
more transparency in the extractive
industries,45 and leveraging open
data by re-calculating the published
accounts of municipalities to explain
arcane budgets more clearly to
citizens.46
A key citizen science initiative running
in conjunction with the United Nations’
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
is the Open Seventeen Challenge,
through which citizens can pitch
crowdsourcing projects to tackle SDGs
via the use of open source data.47 By
unlocking the power of the grassroots
efforts of citizens around the world,
the challenge aims at identifying ideas
and proposals to hold all stakeholders
– including businesses, governments,
NGOs, media and international
organizations – accountable, while
also delivering on the UN global
goals. This initiative sets a precedent

for a new way to interpret monitoring
and evaluation mechanisms, by
entrusting citizens to play a role in these
processes while leveraging the power
of hyperconnectivity.
These examples show how a citizen
science model of grassroots activism
can create new ways for citizens to
engage, facilitate a wider range of lay
participation, and enable bottom-up
community participation. More and
more often, fact-based debates and
activities precede street action and
complement conventional activism
with increased general awareness
and understanding of the policies and
interests at stake. While recognizing
the intrinsic limits of data and statistics
(they can be “based on a firm
foundation of wet sand”), and the need
for citizens to interpret them reasonably
and accurately, citizen science is
pushing citizens closer to deliberation
mechanisms and decision-making
authorities.

3.2 Climate Change and Risks
to Food Security
Part 2
Part 3

The Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC)’s Fifth
Assessment Report reaffirmed that
warming in the climate system is
unequivocal and that it is “extremely
likely” that human influence has been
the dominant cause. The climate is
changing already1 – and, as the World
Bank’s Turn Down the Heat report
explains, failure to limit warming to 2°C
will create a high risk of that change
becoming catastrophic.2 There is
growing realization that failure to act,
quickly and effectively, could reverse
many of the advances of the 20th
century.

Part 4

Risks to Food Security:
Analysis
The risk to food security is especially
great because agriculture is already
straining to meet a rapidly growing
demand from a finite resource base.
The combined impact of a rising
population and growth of the middle
class – wealthier people eat more
cereal-intensive meat – is set to drive
a demand increase of 60% by 2050.3
Yet the global average yield growth for
cereals has slowed in recent years; it
already lags behind demand growth.
This gap cannot be covered by an
expansion of cropland because of
the need to protect forests and other
areas of high value for conservation
and carbon sequestration. Agriculture
is increasingly competing with other
uses for land – such as urbanization,
transport, bioenergy, forestry and
mining – and so crop production is
pushed towards ever more marginal
soils.4
Yet more worrying is the fierce
competition for water, the lifeblood of
agriculture. Water withdrawals have
increased threefold over the last 50
years, and demand is anticipated
to rise by a further 40% by 2030.5
With a shift in global production
Part 3.2 was contributed by Rob Bailey, Chatham
House as well as Bernice Lee and Florian Reber from
the World Economic Forum.
50

The Global Risks Report 2016

towards intensive systems that rely on
groundwater resources for irrigation,
along with the current growth in
demand for water-intensive animal
products, agriculture becomes even
thirstier. At the same time, urbanization
and industrialization in emerging and
developing economies are also driving
up demand for fresh water in energy
production, mineral extraction, and
domestic use, further stretching the
already tight supply.6
Against this backdrop of tightening
constraints, climate change seriously
threatens food security in two ways.
First, it will harm agricultural production:
rising temperatures and changing
rainfall patterns will slow yield gains,
contributing to higher food prices and
an increasingly precarious supplydemand balance that will make
markets more prone to volatility.
Second, it will increasingly disrupt
food systems: more extreme weather
will destabilize tighter markets and
exacerbate volatility, imperil transport
infrastructure and trigger local
food crises. As a result, the risks of
humanitarian emergencies, national or
regional instability and mass migration
will increase. In the words of a former
Executive Director of the World Food
Programme, “without food, people
have only three options. They riot, they
emigrate, or they die.”7 The security
implications will be felt by developing
and developed countries alike.
Climate Impacts on Agricultural
Production
Climate change will slow global yield
growth because higher average
temperatures result in shorter growing
seasons and lower yields. Shifting
rainfall patterns can also reduce yields
because lower rainfall reduces soil
moisture or increased rainfall waterlogs
soils. Climate trends are already
believed to be diminishing global yields
of maize and wheat.8

As climate change gathers pace, the
negative impacts on yields will become
more pronounced.9 This is unlikely
to be a steady deterioration. Yield
responses to biophysical stresses
are highly non-linear – once critical
thresholds for temperature or water are
breached, plants suffer severe damage
and yields can fall precipitously. If
climate change is allowed to reach
a point where these biophysical
thresholds are exceeded routinely, crop
failure will become the norm.
A global temperature increase of
4.7°C – consistent with what might be
expected by the end of the century on
current emissions trajectories – would
see sharp increases in the risk of
critical temperatures being exceeded.
The risk of failure will vary by crop and
location. For example, researchers
estimate that for maize in Illinois, in
the Midwestern United States, the
likelihood of temperature exceeding
a critical threshold currently has a
recurrence interval of 1 in 100 years;
this would increase to a 1 in 6 year
return period. For single-variety rice in
Jiangsu on the eastern coast of China,
the return period would increase from 1
in 100 years today to as often 1 in every
4 or 5 years.10
At lower levels of warming, yield losses
may be offset by higher concentrations
of atmospheric carbon dioxide,
resulting in a beneficial CO2 fertilization
effect. However, the extent of this effect
has recently been questioned.11 Other
factors associated with climate change
– such as elevated tropospheric
ozone,12 as well as increased biotic
stress from weeds, pests and disease
– represent further downside risk to
yields.13
Some of the most severe risks are
faced by countries or regions with high
levels of existing poverty and food
insecurity, which are highly dependent
on agriculture for livelihoods. Even
at low levels of warming, the most
vulnerable countries will suffer serious
impacts. In Sub-Saharan Africa, for
example, 1.5°C of warming globally by
the 2030s could bring a 40% loss in
maize cropping areas. A world warmer
by 2°C would bring unprecedented
heat extremes in summer across

60–70% of South-East Asia. Warming
of 4°C would likely bring increasing
extremes in rainfall patterns in South
Asia – up to a 30% decline in the dry
season and a 30% increase during the
wet season – increasing the risk of both
flood and drought.14
As the map in Figure 3.2.1 indicates,
the most severe yield impacts are not
confined to poor and food-insecure
countries. Agricultural productivity
is also at risk in key exporting
breadbasket regions such as North
America, South America, the Black
Sea area and Australia. The same
is true for India and China – the two
most populous nations on Earth, both
currently committed to self-sufficiency
(in practice, trade neutrality) in
cereals. Should they have to abandon
these policies of self-sufficiency, the
consequences will be felt globally in
the form of tighter international markets
and higher prices. Reducing the risk
of climate change to crop yields will
necessarily encompass adapting
agriculture to new regions (Box 3.2.1).

Several attempts have been made to
model the impact of climate change
on future food prices.15 The modelled
impacts vary considerably, depending
on the underlying model parameters,
climate scenarios, adaptation
responses, and data employed.
However, in the vast majority of cases
the models find higher prices with
climate change than without. Taking
the mean of nine different models all
using the IPCC “business as usual”
emissions pathway finds that global
crop prices will be 20% higher in 2050
than they would have been without
climate change.16 These models show
that oil seed prices typically increase
the most under climate change (up
to 89% above a scenario with no
climate change), though the largest
single climate-induced price increase
modelled is for coarse grains, at 118%
above the 2050 baseline.17
Extreme Weather and Disruption of
Food Systems
Some of climate change’s most serious
risks to food security arise from more
frequent and extreme weather events

such as droughts, heat waves and
floods. These can trigger local food
crises, disrupt trade infrastructure
and have cascading systemic
consequences – for example, crop
failure in a major breadbasket region
can precipitate international food price
spikes.
Food Crises and Humanitarian
Emergencies
Droughts or floods can have
catastrophic localized consequences in
regions where food insecurity is already
high and markets do not function
well. Recent history provides some
tragic examples. The 2010 Pakistan
floods, caused by a wetter monsoon
consistent with climate change
predictions, devastated croplands and
led to a collapse in rural incomes and
sharp deterioration in food security.
One year later, a drought in East Africa
– since linked to climate change18 –
triggered a regional food crisis affecting
13 million people; in war-ravaged
Somalia, over a quarter of a million
people died in the resulting famine.

Part 1

Box 3.2.1: Adaptation and Its Limits

Part 2

The adaptation of agriculture is critical to reduce the risk climate change poses to food systems. A number of strategies and
technologies have emerged to increase resiliency in individual livelihoods and the systems supporting agricultural value chains.
These can be exercised at the farm level through techniques such as changing the cropping calendar, breeding plants that
have increased tolerance to extreme conditions, or shifting crop production to new regions – however, such approaches are
not without their challenges. Plant breeding takes time and is ultimately subject to biophysical limits that exhibit little genetic
variation within or across crops; it is hard to selectively breed for tolerance to extremes. In addition, the limited availability of
suitable land means crop production cannot always migrate as desired (for example, the poor quality of soils to the north of
Russia’s wheat crop means production cannot simply track northwards as temperatures rise).

Part 3

Therefore adaptation is also critical at the landscape level through economically viable strategies that protect biodiversity and
enhance land and forest management. Market systems have a critical role to play too, especially through products such as
index-based weather insurance or information systems. Finally, enabling policies for the careful management and use of food
reserves, early warning systems, open trade arrangements and price stabilization can help address volatility in the system.

Part 4

Distribution and Transport
Infrastructure
Extreme weather events pose a risk not
only to the production of crops but also
to the distribution of globally traded
supply. Critical transport infrastructure
in many of the world’s largest cereal
exporters is increasingly at risk of
disruption from acute and chronic
climate stresses.19
In July 2012, for example, Russia’s
Black Sea ports were struck by flash
floods, damaging key grain export
infrastructure and interrupting trade in a
year when drought had already brought
a 25% drop in production.20 In the
United States, the ageing network of
locks and dams along the Mississippi
River – a key artery for wheat, maize
and soybean exports – has struggled
to cope with rainfall extremes: in 2011,
flooding led to delays in barge traffic
and rerouting of freight via road and
rail; the following year a severe drought
saw water levels fall to levels that were
almost unnavigable.21 More frequent
heatwaves and floods are also exerting
increasing stress on the country’s
railways and roads.22 If sea levels rise
by 4 feet by 2100 as projected in recent
climate models,23 around two-thirds of
port facilities along the US Gulf Coast –
out of which 20% of the world’s maize
and soy exports are shipped24 – will be
at risk of water damage or inundation.25
Damage to port infrastructure following
an extreme climate event further
exacerbates disaster situations,
hindering the delivery of critical food
supplies to affected populations and
52

limiting the rate of economic recovery
in the longer term. When Cyclone Pam
hit Vanuatu in March 2015, maritime
services to the islands were interrupted
for 10 days and 80% of the country’s
roads were blocked by debris.26
Preparedness for disruption to
transport infrastructure along food
supply chains is often low. Climate
proofing transport infrastructure
brings higher maintenance costs
while diverting investment away from
the expansion of network capacity.27
Yet as competition for capacity
heightens, and just-in-time business
models favour cost-efficiency over
system redundancies,28 the potential
impact of climate events on transport
infrastructure will rise, signalling an ever
more severe risk to food security in
import-dependent regions.
Systemic Crises
Although developed economies may
be largely untroubled by food price
spikes, they are vulnerable to knockon effects – such as instability and
migration – arising from the impacts of
price spikes in less resilient countries.
Recent years have witnessed a series
of spikes in international cereal market
prices triggered by extreme weather
since linked to climate change – most
notably the 2010 Russian heatwave
and 2012 US Midwest drought.29 Price
rises can be amplified if governments
prioritize domestic food security at
the expense of global food security
by panic-buying, hoarding and
unilateral export controls. In 2008,

international cereal markets reached
a crisis point when 40 governments
imposed export restrictions on their
agriculture sectors in a vicious circle of
collapsing confidence and escalating
prices.30 Global governance was
found wanting: while trade rules exist
to limit restrictions on imports, there is
nothing comparable to prevent limits on
exports.
Once again, the poorest countries are
most at risk. The 2008 crisis meant
33 net food-importing developing
countries saw an increase in their
total food import bill of 0.8% of GDP,
contributing to deteriorations in the
balance of payments and inflation.31
Because of a high reliance on
unprocessed staples, the poorest
households are particularly exposed
to rises in primary commodity prices.
The World Bank estimates that the
2008 crisis put 100 million more people
into poverty globally.32 Among these
households, food expenditures may
account for more than half of income,
leaving families in a very difficult
situation if prices spike.
High food prices in turn increase the
risk of riots and instability, particularly
in countries that are politically fragile.33
During the 2008 food crisis, protests
erupted in 61 countries and riots
in 23.34 Such events can lead to
cascading risks that move rapidly
through markets and polities with
near- and long-term consequences.
The spike in international wheat prices
after the 2010 Russian heatwave was
felt keenly in North Africa – the largest

Box 3.2.2: Reducing Food Waste

Part 2

Current estimates suggest around one-third of all food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted along the food
value chain, with a direct economic cost of US$750 billion per year. Excluding land-use change, the annual emissions
footprint of food produced but not consumed is around 3.3 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), more than
the total national emissions of India; the land requirement is almost 1.4 billion hectares, close to 30% of the world’s
agricultural land area; and the blue water (surface and groundwater) consumption is approximately 250 cubic kilometres,
three times the volume of Lake Geneva.1

Part 3

Approximately half of this volume (54%) is lost in upstream processes including agricultural production (a third of the total
alone) and post-harvest handling and storage; the other half (46%) is wasted in downstream activities such as processing,
distribution, and consumption. Consumption wastage is much higher in high- and middle-income regions (31–39% of total
losses) than in low-income regions (4–16%). Significant low-income losses at the post-harvest stage result from a lack of
adequate infrastructure to prevent spoiling.2
Compounding the problem of direct losses are wasteful, or resource-inefficient, forms of food production: grain-fed
livestock production, for example, results in significant losses of edible calories along the food chain from those available
from plants to those ultimately consumed by humans. This inefficiency is expected to become increasingly significant as a
growing global middle class consumes more meat.

Part 4

The cost of food wastage is significant not only in economic terms, but also for current and future resource and food
security. Addressing food wastage offers significant potential to alleviate pressures on natural resources and the tightening
balance of supply and demand: it is estimated that halving the current rate of wastage could meet over a fifth of caloric
needs by 2050,3 reducing required cropland by 14% and agricultural greenhouse gas emissions by 22–28% (saving
approximately 4.5 GtCO2e per year) relative to the counterfactual of no reduction in food wastage.4
Currently the environmental costs of food waste are externalized and the market incentives to reduce waste are minimal.
Maintaining supply chains that deliver year-round uninterrupted supplies of produce are inherently wasteful because
retailers depend on over-ordering and suppliers on over-producing. But currently the economic benefits of this model
outweigh the costs. Exacting retail quality and presentation standards, consumer expectations, and legislation governing
food re-use all exacerbate the problem by rejecting perfectly edible but non-aesthetically pleasing produce. Minimizing
waste will therefore require technical innovations, legislative reform, and a recalibration of consumer expectations.5

wheat-importing region in the world
– where the price of bread was the
subject of initial protests that became
the 2011 Arab Spring.
In the same year, a prolonged drought
in Syria – since linked to climate change
– contributed to rural-urban migration
that heightened tensions in the nation’s
cities before conflict erupted, leading
to a civil war that remains in progress.35
The long-term consequences of the
sequence of events, beginning with
extreme weather and ending with the
Arab Spring and Syrian civil war, are still
playing out through ongoing conflict,
mass migration and increased risk of
terrorism.

Droughts, floods and heatwaves will
become increasingly severe as climate
change accelerates. Extreme El Niño
events, which can wreak havoc with
harvests in breadbaskets and food
insecure regions alike, are expected
to become more common.36 The risk
of production shocks with systemic
consequences is increasing, with
profound implications for the stability of
international markets: one recent study
found that what would have been a
1-in-100 year global production shock
over the second half of the 20th century
may have become a 1-in-30 year
event by 2050 – a more than threefold
increase in risk.37 A double breadbasket
failure, in which two critical harvests are
lost, now represents a plausible worst-

case scenario that could precipitate
a systemic crisis of unprecedented
magnitude.38
Conclusions
Climate change presents a profound
threat to food security because
biophysical stresses mean it will
become increasingly difficult for
agriculture to meet demand, and
more extreme weather increases the
risk of both local and systemic food
crises. The poorest countries are
most vulnerable, but crop failures in
systemically important production
regions will have global consequences
that may extend beyond food systems.

Part 1
Part 2

Trade will be critical to managing
short-term production shortfalls and
matching long-term changes in supply
and demand as the impacts of climate
change on production accelerate
and demand for food increases in
developing countries. However,
as markets become increasingly
vulnerable to destabilizing production
shocks in breadbasket regions, they
will become a source of risk as well as
a means of managing risk.

Part 3

Adaptation of agriculture is a priority
for both public and private sectors,
but it is not a panacea (see Box 3.2.1).
Agriculture is only one part of the global
food system. Transport infrastructure
must also be climate-proofed. System
resilience requires new rules to militate
against export controls and may
necessitate efficiency trade-offs such
as increased strategic storage.

Part 4

More fundamentally, there are limits
to what agricultural adaptation can
achieve and significant uncertainty
about where, and when, these limits
will be reached. The longer climate
change continues, the more likely
it is that these limits will be found.
According to the IPCC, “there may
be a threshold of global warming
beyond which current agricultural
practices can no longer support
large human civilizations.”39 Without
ambitious, determined action to reduce
emissions and contain climate change
at manageable levels, long-term food
security cannot be guaranteed.

Spheres of Action to
Mitigate the Climate Risk
on Food Security
This section addresses three spheres
in which action can be taken. These
include the use of big data to boost the
efficiency and specificity of climate-risk
information; the provision of insurance
innovations that can reduce risk to
small farmers, who are an essential
and fundamental aspect of agricultural
success; and the incentivization
of climate-resilient, low-carbon
investments.

Timely, accessible and actionable

below, which could help reduce
exposure to economic losses.

For many least-developed
countries and small island
developing states, improved
early-warning systems for natural
disasters are a key enabler of
sustained and climate-resilient
growth and development.
Responding to that need, the
government of France proposed at
the Third UN World Conference on
Disaster Risk Reduction in March
2015 in Sendai, Japan, to mobilize
the international community to
improve the climate resiliency of
vulnerable countries, namely Small
Island Development States and
Least Developed Countries. During
the COP21 meetings in Paris,
the Climate Risk Early Warning
Systems (CREWS) initiative
was officially launched by the
governments of Australia, Canada,
France, Germany, Luxembourg
and the Netherlands. Collectively,
the six countries pledged over
US$80 million to scale up improved
climate-risk early warning systems
across 80 countries.

The Climate Services for
Resilient Development
Partnership was launched by
the United States during the
Climate Summit in partnership
with the United Kingdom, the
Asian Development Bank, the
Inter-American Development Bank,
Google, the Skoll Global Threats
Fund, the American Red Cross,
and the GIS software company
Environmental Systems Research
Institute (ESRI).

Tailored information is critical, given the
complexity and geographic specificity
of climate change impacts. One
example is high-resolution topographic
data, which will be made available by
the US Geological Survey following
a White House announcement last
September. The data, generated from
NASA’s Shuttle Radar Topography
Mission (SRTM) in 2000, previously
covered only the United States; it
is now also available for Africa, and
next year will expand to include Latin
America and the Caribbean. This kind
of topographic data could greatly
enhance agricultural planning for
drought, glacial retreat, inland flooding,
landslides and coastal storm surges.40
However, enhanced information alone
is not enough. Equally essential is the
capability to model potential impacts on
interconnected environmental, social
and economic systems if vulnerable
communities are to develop the better
capacities and integrated policies
needed for long-term resilience. It
is challenging, however, to develop
actionable information from a large
range of data gathered from different
sources. Data are mostly insufficient
to meet the information needs for
evidence-based climate adaptation,
especially in vulnerable developing
regions that have large agricultural
sectors exposed to increased climate
risk.
Consequently, attention is increasingly
turning towards broad-based
partnerships that bring together
information services, policy resources,
technological and modelling skills
and capacity building and training.
Many of these partnerships cut across
public and private sectors to leverage

Part 1

–

A partnership between Google and
the Brazilian environmental NGO
Imazon, Google Earth Engine
integrates satellite measurements
dating back decades with other
data feeds such as weather
information to map changes such
as deforestation in remote areas.
Future applications will enable
monitoring of sea ice change and
illegal fishing.

Weather index insurance schemes,
also known as “index-based financial
risk-transfer mechanisms”, pay
out based on weather rather than
crop losses. They use an index of
productivity-relevant weather variables
such as precipitation onset and
intensity, streamflow and temperature:
the insurance pays out, for example, if
measured rainfall falls below a specified
level.

–

IBM’s Insight Cloud Service, a
partnership with Twitter and the
Weather Company, combines
open data with private data to
produce analytics enabling, for
example, insurance companies to
issue weather warnings to policyholders.

One advantage of weather index
insurance is that it removes the need
for expensive field visits to assess crop
damage, reducing costs and improving
accessibility of insurance for lowincome smallholder farmers. Having
such insurance coverage can create a
virtuous circle: it often is a necessary
condition for accessing bank loans or
other credit, which in turn can be used
to invest in improved agricultural inputs
for increased productivity and reduced
risk exposure. Weather index insurance
schemes also remove the possibility of
poorly designed crop failure insurance
schemes that effectively incentivize
farmers to allow crops to fail.

Such programmes illustrate how largescale collaborative efforts that leverage
large data sets, scientific modelling,
computational power and capacitybuilding programmes can improve local
decision-making to increase resilience
and reduce exposure to important food
security-related risks.
2. Reducing Economic Exposure
through Insurance Innovations
Crop insurance schemes do not
always deliver sufficient protection
for small farmers against potential
losses – either because they are too
expensive for low-income smallholder
farmers or because they provide
perverse incentives that discourage
policy-holders from investing in crop
productivity. International aid for
disaster relief financing has often
proved to be slow, ad hoc and
expensive. Innovative climate-informed
insurance schemes can help to
address the shortcomings in these two
models, efficiently reducing exposure

With nearly two-thirds of its population
working in agriculture – 80% as
smallholder farmers – Sub-Saharan
Africa is especially vulnerable to food
insecurity caused by droughts and
temperature rises. World Bank data
suggest that Sub-Saharan countries
will need between US$14 billion and
US$17 billion per year from 2010 to
2050 to adapt to climate change.42
The Africa Risk Capacity (ARC) is
an innovative African Union initiative,
launched in 2014, to help close the
financing gap by improving insurance
for climate-related risks.
ARC combines several risk transfer
mechanisms to reduce the cost

In addition to regular ARC insurance
schemes covering the costs for
immediate responses to weather
disasters, the ARC Extreme Climate
Facility will issue data-based climate
change catastrophe risk bonds to
participating countries.43 These bonds
are structured as concessional finance
that must be used to reduce risk
exposure and vulnerability. This not
only provides countries with incentives
to invest in climate-smart agriculture,
but also improves long-term planning
and reduces investment risks for the
private sector. By blending public and
private finance, ARC hopes to generate
over US$1 billion in additional finance
over the next 30 years.
3. Financial System Shift to Unleash
Climate-Resilient, Low-Carbon
Investments
Effectively tackling climate-induced
risks will require new ways to incentivize
climate-smart investment. Despite
increasing recognition of the economic
risks, global financial systems are
yet to incorporate them into financial
decision-making. Finding ways to
adapt established risk assessment
analytics, models and reporting
frameworks could unleash larger flows
of capital towards climate-friendlier
investments.
For many executives and boards of
directors, climate risks seem less
immediate than other issues. Even
where Environment, Social and
Corporate Governance (ESG) data
are disclosed, investors often remain
unaware of the severity of the threat:
these data tend to be appended in an
annex rather than integrated into core
financial statements, and they do not
make clear the materiality of specific
climate and regulatory risks. The sheer
number of ESG criteria is a barrier
to comparability and identification of

Robust and affordable weather
insurance depends on the availability of
accurate data, together with improved
capabilities to forecast weather
variability and extreme events such
as droughts. Today a combination of
data provided by weather stations with
remote sensing and satellite imagery
are helping scale innovative insurance
schemes across developing countries.

of insurance while increasing its
effectiveness. For example, because
not all parts of the continent will be
affected by drought at the same
time, by pooling drought risk across
all member countries ARC can
reduce individual premiums paid
by governments by up to 50%. To
be eligible for insurance through
ARC, governments have to develop
evidence-based contingency plans.

to economic losses and thereby food
insecurity.

The World Resources Institute
developed Global Forest Watch
is an online system to monitor
forests and provide information to
improve their management (see
http://www.globalforestwatch.org/
about/awards_and_testimonials).
It combines satellite data
with modern mapping and
information and communication
technologies to enable a new kind
of environmental monitoring and
decision-support tools.

material risk. Most analysts do not take
opportunities such as earnings calls to
raise questions on material climate risk.

Part 2
Part 3

Finding ways to factor climate and
regulatory risks into short-term
decision-making processes and related
financial metrics is essential for driving
climate risk–informed investments. This
requires not only using better, forwardlooking data and metrics, but also
mainstreaming these elements in core
financial processes and indicators. One
major step in that direction is the recent
announcement of Mark Carney, the
Governor of the Bank of England and
Chair of the G20’s Financial Stability
Board (FSB), for the FSB to support
global efforts for voluntary standardized
reporting on financial risks associated
with climate change.

Part 4

Corporate commitments and domestic
regulatory reform can also be important
drivers of change. At the COP21 in
Paris a number of new corporate
commitments to decarbonize
portfolios, issue green bonds, or
support more robust carbon pricing
were made. They send important
signals to the broader business and
investment communities and help
to win the trust of governments in
corporate support for improved
climate-friendly regulations. China’s
Green Credit Policy, launched in 2007,
is an example of how regulators can
tip markets towards more sustainable
investment.
Understanding how regulatory reform
across sectors can help align financial
markets with sustainable development
is the objective of the United Nations
Environment Programme’s Inquiry
into the Design of a Sustainable
Financial System. Other recently
launched initiatives seek to align
various aspects of the financial markets
with climate-associated financial risk
and sustainable development:

The AR!SE Initiative (Private
Sector Alliance for Disaster
Resilient Societies), a global effort
led by the United Nations Office for
Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR),
aims to provide a new vehicle for
collaboration between the private
and public sectors that can unlock
enormous potential at the local,
national, regional and global levels
to contribute to achieving the
The Global Risks Report 2016

outcome, goals and targets of the
Sendai Framework for Disaster
Risk Reduction 2015–2030.44
By engaging and expanding
the number of private sector
organizations and others involved
in supporting the implementation of
the Sendai Framework for Disaster,
AR!SE will provide a robust and
effective mechanism to allow
the private sector to implement
tangible projects and initiatives
that deliver results critical to the
achievement of the outcome and
goal of the Sendai Framework.45
–

The Investor Confidence
Project, led by the Environmental
Defense Fund, seeks to create a
marketplace for energy efficiency
by standardizing energy efficiency
protocols. Standards are an
important enabler for growing
investments in emerging industries
because they provide the
transparency, comparability and
security required by underwriters
and investors. Retrofitting buildings
to be more energy efficient is
one example where lack of
standardization is a barrier to
scaling up investment, despite the
clear economic benefits.

The Banking Environment
Initiative (comprising Barclays,
BNP Parisbas, BNY Mellon,
Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs,
Lloyds Banking Group, Northern
Trust, The Royal Bank of Scotland
(RBS), Santander, SMBC,
Standard Chartered, Westpac)
has led the development of new
trade finance instruments, such
as Sustainable Shipment Letter
of Credits, intended to incentivize
sustainable land use and to
preserve forests when working in
developing tropical nations.

–

The 1-in-100 Initiative seeks
to stimulate and reward
climate-resilient investment
through collaboration involving
insurance companies, regulators,
scientists, modellers, accounting
professionals, investors and
other stakeholders. The initiative
focuses on adapting lessons
from the insurance industry about
how regulatory reform for capital
requirements and accounting
procedures can be applied to other

economic sectors to increase the
resilience of balance sheets to
climate shocks, while increasing
the transparency of a company’s
exposure to climate risk.

3.3 Global Disease Outbreaks

At the same time, new opportunities
to predict, prevent, detect and
treat diseases are emerging from a
better understanding of the social
determinants of health and from trends
including new technologies in real-time
diagnosis, data analysis (including
in the field of genomics), biomedical
research, the internet and mobile data
and communications, often developed
outside the traditional health sector.
More innovative ideas, partnerships,
and ways of working and financing will
be critical for containing the dynamic
threat of outbreaks in the 21st century.

Meanwhile the increasing transnational
flow of commodities, people and
animals coupled with increased spatial
density will magnify the transmission
of these diseases, both between
people and across the human-animal
barrier.3 Most large cities have airports
through which millions of passengers
travel: over 2 billion global passengers
travelled annually by air in the first
decade of the 21st century, compared
with just 68.5 million in the 1950s.4
Continued growth in the movement
of people and commodities between
urban centres intensifies the risk
of infectious transmissions across
geographies and diminishes the ability
to respond to, and effectively prepare
for, a global disease outbreak.
A recent study led by the University
of Cambridge identified 20 known
infectious diseases that have reemerged or spread geographically,
including dengue, chikungunya,
typhoid, West Nile, artemisininresistant malaria and the plague.5 Other
known threats – such as influenza
(i.e. H1N1 Swine Flu), MERS-Cov,
and Ebola – continue to raise fears,
especially when they take hold in
densely populated areas and when
treatment and prevention measures
are not necessarily available. Even
when known infectious diseases can
be mitigated by existing treatments or
vaccines, we face the risk of emerging

Infectious diseases that are not
currently on the radar are also a cause
for concern. The greatest potential
threats among unknown pathogens
are those that spread easily – through
the air, for instance – and to which
humans have little or no immunity. The
2002–2003 SARS pandemic provides
one recent case study: ultimately
governments, businesses and people
came together to overcome the
outbreak, although not before it had
caused nearly 8,000 infections and 800
deaths across 29 countries.8 The death
toll would have been much higher had
the virus been more easily spread:
infectious disease experts believe that
if SARS had been more contagious, it
could have become one of the worst
pandemics since the 1918 influenza
outbreak that killed 50 million people.9
The SARS crisis demonstrates the
socially destabilizing potential of
unfamiliar new diseases. As affected

Part 4

Infectious diseases, which are
among the leading causes of death
worldwide, do not confine themselves
to national borders. Their capacity to
spread rapidly across geographies
– jeopardizing social and economic
security as well as challenging human
health and well-being – is amplified by
ever-growing globalization, increased
trade and travel, the rise in urbanization,
and changes in the environment,
behaviour and society. Some threats,
such as influenza, are known. Others
are not. Unknown just a few decades
ago, HIV/AIDS has killed more than 30
million people from all socio-economic
backgrounds. What might be the
next HIV/AIDS, and are we sufficiently
prepared for its arrival?

By 2050, the world’s population will
have risen to 9.7 billion.2 Cities will
become increasingly dense and shanty
towns – with inadequate housing and
a lack of basic services such as water,
sewerage and waste management
– will swell. A combination of high
population density, poverty, changes
in social structures, and a lack
of public health infrastructure will
create progressively more favourable
conditions for communicable diseases.

Part 3

The recent Ebola crisis will not be the
last serious epidemic the world faces;
indeed, public health outbreaks are
likely to become ever more complex
and challenging. Despite progress in
some aspects of public health over the
past two decades, endemic infectious
diseases remain a major problem, and
new or resurging infections, the spread
of drug resistance and the rise in
non-communicable diseases all pose
enormous challenges to often fragile
health systems.1

Causes for Concern

Advances in research and the
discovery of diagnostics, drugs and
vaccines have saved millions of lives,
but these gains remain very fragile
and are under threat from the growing
resistance of microorganisms to the
most effective known medicines. The
number of deaths in the European
Union and the United States as a
direct result of antibiotic-resistant
bacteria is increasing every year,
and the burden in low- and middleincome countries is much higher.6
The emergence and spread of strains
of HIV, tuberculosis and malaria that
have evolved resistance to current
medicines are of particular concern,
as they could overturn much of the
progress made against these diseases
in recent years. An independent review,
funded by the Wellcome Trust and
the UK government, estimates that
by 2050, if no action is taken, these
drug-resistant strains could cost an
additional 10 million lives each year and
around US$100 trillion in lost output;
approximately the equivalent of losing
the UK economy from global output
every year.7

areas came to a standstill, in cities
such as Beijing, Singapore and Toronto
people stayed home, public places
emptied and health workers were
shunned.10 Next time an unfamiliar
disease causes panic, there is no
guarantee that it will occur in a
geography where effective solutions
can be initiated as quickly as in this
instance. Furthermore, the risk posed
by the immediate effects of outbreaks
must not minimize the long-lasting
effects on society as a whole. The
recent Ebola crisis in West Africa
points to the intensified nature of the
risk and its heightened complexity
in places where health systems are
vulnerable and lack diagnostic or
response measures. Over the course
of the crisis, more than 11,000 people
died and more than 16,000 children
were orphaned.11 Basic health services
such as prenatal consultations, routine
vaccinations, antiretroviral therapies
and treatment of endemic diseases
in the region were sharply reduced.
As stigma rose, schools closed while
growing distrust and fear shifted
community interactions. The hours of
schooling lost, the reconfiguration of
families, and decreased food security
and employment, to name only a few of
the epidemic’s effects, will impact the
affected region well beyond the halt of
the outbreak.12
Economic Risks
Beyond direct effects on health,
infectious diseases impose significant
economic costs. Adding to the direct
costs borne by sufferers and their
households, infectious diseases –
particularly those that are relatively fastspreading or poorly understood by the
general population – have an additional
economic impact through a response
called “aversion behaviour”. This was
demonstrated when Singapore came
to an economic standstill over SARS,
as well as in responses to Ebola in 2014
and HIV/AIDS in the early 1980s.
Aversion behaviour includes actions
taken by individuals to avoid any
exposure to the illness, as well as
actions taken by investors as they
anticipate those individual decisions.13
Even individuals who have no direct
contact with the disease will take a
range of actions to avoid any risk of
contracting the disease. As shown
60

The Global Risks Report 2016

by the recent Ebola outbreak, these
reactions can be rational or they can
dramatically overestimate risk, leading
to a wide variety of factors that can
negatively impact the economy, from
stress to labour and supply scarcity,
financial market instability, and price
increases.
The economic impact of aversion
behaviour may be significantly greater
than the direct economic impact from
sickness and death. In the Ebola crisis,
the loss of life in Guinea, Liberia, and
Sierra Leone was accompanied by
the closure of businesses, dramatic
reductions in travel and tourism,
and trade slowing to a trickle. At the
beginning of 2014, expected economic
growth for the year was 5.9% in Liberia,
11.3% in Sierra Leone and 4.5% in
Guinea. By the end of the year, actual
growth was only 2.2% in Liberia and
4.0% in Sierra Leone, while in Guinea
the economy shrank.14 In Liberia, more
than 70% of households reported
having insufficient money to buy
food.15 The adverse impacts were not
restricted to countries that experienced
cases of Ebola: Burkina Faso, Côte
d’Ivoire and the Gambia all experienced
adverse impacts on GDP.16 For 2015,
the World Bank estimated a potential
loss in GDP of more than US$1.6 billion
in the three most affected countries,
and more than US$500 million across
the rest of the continent.
Any fears about an inability to
contain a major epidemic will have
economic effects outside the affected
areas because of the increasingly
interconnected nature of the global
economy. The economic impact of
the Ebola epidemic could have been
much worse: at its height, the most
pessimistic epidemiological projections
of how the disease could spread,
combined with economic modelling,
suggested a potential impact of tens
of billions of dollars in West Africa
alone.17 During the SARS outbreak in
2003, estimates of the potential impact
ranged from US$30 billion to US$100
billion. In the case of SARS, too, the
actual impact was likely lower because
the epidemic was contained – but the
economic damage was still significant.18

Challenges in Containing the Risks
To know where to channel resources
most effectively, stakeholders face
the challenges of preparing for
and responding to known threats
and anticipating the source of new
ones. The lack of adequate, resilient
public health surveillance systems,
infrastructure to effectively deploy
resources and a health workforce to
provide accessible, quality care where
needed leaves us vulnerable to regional
and global spread. Many emerging
infections and antibiotic-resistant
strains of common diseases originate
in one location and then disseminate to
new places at often alarming speeds:
societies are only as strong as the most
fragile health system (see Initiative 1).
Preparedness and response measures
must therefore address three key
areas: behaviour; diagnostic, drug and
vaccine research and development
(R&D); and regulatory and financial
environments.
Behaviour
The multifactorial nature of broader
global health issues poses an
enormous challenge to all stakeholders
– governments, non-governmental
organizations (NGOs), industry and
citizens. Changing demographics,
climate change, urbanization, travel,
political instability, war and terrorism
are only a few of the factors challenging
our preparedness for and response
to endemic and emerging infections
and the spread of non-communicable
diseases.
There is an urgent need for society
to value and invest more in evidenceinformed public health strategies.
Despite major advances in the global
economy over the past 50 years,
millions of people worldwide still cannot
access basic needs, such as improved
tap water and toilets.
Even with political interventions to
provide the necessary infrastructure,
halting the spread of infectious
diseases will require addressing
individual and collective human
behaviours. Proper prevention
and responsible, fact-based
crisis communication, including
educational campaigns and behaviour
change strategies to facilitate the
long-term adoption of health-

Part 1

Box 3.3.1: Health Communication

maintaining behaviours, need to be
carefully designed, field-tested and
implemented (see Box 3.3.1).
Understanding the social and cultural
contexts that may contribute to
epidemics, such as burial practices
or misconceptions about how a
disease is transmitted, is also critical.
To increase trust in evidence-based
medical interventions, it is essential to
gain insight into cultural sensitivities
and work in partnership with local
communities.
Diagnostic, Drug and Vaccine
Research and Development
It can take 20–30 years to develop a
new drug or vaccine, and the costs
and risks are high. R&D efforts are not
coordinated to achieve their greatest
impact: the current model prioritizes
the development of profitable products
that can generate maximum sales,
usually through volume rather than
benefits, instead of focusing on unmet
public health priorities. There is a lack
of mechanisms that incentivize and
stimulate the development of novel

diagnostics, drugs, and vaccines and
compliance with treatments.19
The recent Ebola outbreak arguably
illustrates the human cost of the
current development model in the
face of potential public health threats.
Recent tests on an Ebola vaccine in
Guinea seem to show that it provides
remarkable and immediate protection;
however, the same vaccine had
been tested on monkeys a decade
ago, but subsequently languished in
scientific limbo (see Box 3.3.2).20 Had
resources been devoted to following
through earlier, the development of a
vaccine could have been accelerated,
potentially saving many of the 11,000
casualties.
Regulatory and Financial Environments
Despite the progress that has been
made in the last two decades, more
needs to be done to create enabling
regulatory environments. Development
of the aforementioned Ebola vaccine,
for example, could conceivably have
been accelerated more quickly as the
epidemic took hold, but a number

Countries need to be empowered to
allow a timely and robust response so
they can request and expect speedy
international assistance when needed.
Incentives and financing mechanisms
need to be generated to encourage
investments in public health, and
countries need to be held accountable.
Platforms such as the Global Health
Security Agenda and the WHO’s Global
Influenza Surveillance and Response
System have had some success and
aim to complement current regulations
and mitigate threats, but they fall short
of constituting a comprehensive,
robust global system with the flexibility
to defend against both known and
unknown biological threats.
The Future of Collaboration
From logistics to communications, from
financial services to pharmaceuticals,
the private sector has capabilities and
expertise that can be truly beneficial in
a public health outbreak. To leverage
them most effectively, however,
requires common ground and trustbased cooperating mechanisms at
local and global levels with the public
and non-government sectors that have
been established in advance of an
emergency (see Initiative 2).

The Global Risks Report 2016

61

Part 4

The incentives employed are not necessarily monetary; they could be compliance
with social norms or aversion to risk, drawing on insights from behavioural
economics, psychology, anthropology and neuroscience. After the British
government led the way in the late 2000s, many countries have set up behavioural
insight units that have led to significant improvement in the effectiveness of public
health prevention. On 15 September 2015, President Obama signed an executive
order to further the use of behavioural insights in improving policy-making.

Part 3

Prevention is another area in which communication must be handled with care. For
decades, governing bodies have considered that simply providing the most
accurate information to people was the best way to improve public health
prevention. However, evidence for this approach has not been encouraging –
messages on the dangers of smoking, for example, have had relatively little effect
on behaviour. As understanding grows about the circumstances in which
individuals do not make rational choices, a more subtle form of prevention is
getting momentum. As well as providing information, this involves “nudges” –
evidence-informed strategies that, rather than forced compliance, encourage the
adoption of behaviours and habits that are good for people and social groups.

The sluggishness of progress towards
a regulatory environment specifically
targeted to epidemic crisis situations
is a matter of growing international
concern. This work needs to be
coordinated by an empowered and
properly funded global health body:
the World Health Organization (WHO).
A collaborative framework exists –
the International Health Regulations,
originally created in 1969 to contain
cholera, smallpox, yellow fever and the
plague, and since expanded to cover
more diseases – but it does not provide
adequate reassurance that countries
are putting in place what is needed to
prepare for, and respond to, emerging
crises.

Part 2

Health communication often receives less attention and fewer resources than
medical, scientific or policy areas. However, failure to convey the right information
risks costly consequences at the individual and societal levels. In a crisis situation,
panic can spread quickly and the way communication is handled can either cost
or save lives. Models that combine thinking from theories of complex systems,
crowd dynamics, group psychology and information are being used to assess the
impact and effectiveness of mass communication in the event of a major health
outbreak.

of barriers hindered the ability to
expedite clinical trials. Mobile data is
another area where regulations on
privacy need to be balanced with
public health imperatives, as it has
increasing potential to track the spread
of epidemics (see Initiative 3).

Part 1

Box 3.3.2: Developing an Ebola Vaccine: Reflections on the Current Regulatory Environment

Part 2

In the 38 years between the first Ebola epidemic in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo) and its December 2013
emergence in Guinea, methods for containing Ebola were standardized but few advances were made in the development of a
vaccine.
By 2009, at least seven Ebola vaccines had been tested in monkeys.1 Yet by 2014 none had been through phase I safety
testing in healthy human volunteers. There were no existing study protocols for evaluating experimental vaccines or treatments
in an epidemic setting, which meant that it took time to design and agree on the way forward and gain ethical approval. Even
when protocols were agreed, some organizations delayed supplying their therapeutics – not from lack of enthusiasm, but
because they did not have pre-agreed frameworks in place to allow them to do so. As the crisis neared its peak in August
2014, three candidate vaccines were in development with the potential to be used in clinical trials:

Part 3

1.

Merck (Newlink) had VSV-EBOV, originally developed in partnership with the Canadian government. Merck had preclinical
data, but the vaccine had not been tested for safety in phase I human trials. Safety trials commenced only in October
2014.

2.

GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) had ChAd3-ZEBOV, originally developed by Okairos, but again with no human safety data. Phase I
trials began in September 2014.

3.

Johnson & Johnson’s phase I clinical trials began in January 2015.

Part 4

Despite these delays, infectious disease experts argue that in some ways the world was relatively lucky with Ebola – vaccines
had already been in development because the pathogen had been earlier identified as an infection with bioterrorism potential.
This is not the case for other known diseases, such as MERS-CoV, chikungunya and West Nile, which will require a focused
and coordinated R&D effort.
The current development model in vaccinology could be improved in three main ways. First, there should be leadership and
coordination of clinical trial activities in epidemics by a neutral body to ensure that they are efficient and properly prioritized. As
the Ebola outbreak took hold, a multitude of countries and research consortiums planned phase I and II/III clinical trials, but
there was little coordination of these efforts. The WHO, working with member states, philanthropists, industry, NGOs and
academia, should coordinate this priority-setting and ensure equitable access.
Second, phase I clinical trials must be conducted in the inter-epidemic period, at least for known diseases where a vaccine/
treatment is feasible or already in development. We must also develop novel platforms to allow for an assessment and
preparation for hitherto unknown infections. Finally, agreed trial protocols, contracts and initial ethics approvals for phase II/III
studies should be drawn up so that, when an outbreak begins, trials can start within days or weeks, not in months.
Note

Plotkin, Mahmoud, and Farrar 2015.

There is a long history of public-private
cooperation in response to infectious
diseases. The Medicine for Malaria
Venture (MMV) and the Global Alliance
for Vaccine Initiative (GAVI), for instance,
are long-standing examples of crosssector partnership that came out of a
projected public health disaster that
was the result of escalating antimalarial
drug resistance in the late 1990s and
the need for greater equitable access
to vaccines.
Despite these and similar advances,
new collaborative approaches are
needed as the danger of outbreaks
grows. Such approaches could

Part 1

Box 3.3.3: The Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility (PEF)

Part 2

The world’s Ebola response has highlighted the need for new financing mechanisms that can quickly deploy emergency
funding and rapid response teams at the first sign of a crisis.
The World Bank Group is working with the WHO and other partners, including Munich Re and Swiss Re, on one part of the
solution: the Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility (PEF). The PEF would respond to the G20 Brisbane Leaders Statement
on Ebola, and it received the endorsement of G7 leaders in Germany in June 2015. Its open platform structure will be able to
function effectively within the evolving global pandemic financing architecture.

Part 3

Simply put, the PEF would purchase private sector insurance coverage for developing countries to cover the immediate costs
of crisis response. It would deliver financing swiftly to governments and international partners, once a pre-agreed parametric
trigger is invoked. The payouts to the affected countries would come from the bond markets and (re)insurance companies. In
both cases the insurance premium would need funding from donors, although potential beneficiaries could also contribute.
Over time, the PEF would grow in terms of size, geography and events covered, as the market for pandemic risk insurance in
developing countries grows. Governments have already used this model to successfully manage climate and natural disaster
risks.

Part 4

Preventing future infectious disease outbreaks from becoming human and economic tragedies requires action on several
fronts. First, countries must invest in better preparedness, which starts with focusing on core public health functions and
strengthening health systems. Second, there is a need for a smarter, better-coordinated global epidemic preparedness and
response system that draws on the expertise of many more players; in this context, more effective public-private partnerships
are critical, particularly around logistics and communications. Third, a better-resourced and empowered WHO that is
equipped to work with countries in monitoring outbreaks, identifying potential threats and mobilizing on-the-ground support is
an imperative.
Because assessing insurance premiums creates incentives to quantify the risks, a financing mechanism such as the PEF could
help on all the above fronts. It could create two important differences the next time there is a potential pandemic:
–

Financing would be available quickly (within days) from the PEF, bringing discipline and rigour to the whole system
because a response strategy is thought out pre-emptively.

–

The PEF’s design and in-built contingencies would drive the various concerned national and international players to work
together more effectively and coherently in advance, thus ensuring the appropriate highest level of crisis preparedness
and response readiness.

New predictive models, financing
mechanisms and leadership for the
preparedness and response of future
outbreaks and antimicrobial threats are
key to reducing the risks we face in the
short, medium and long term.
The Ebola response was financed by
contributions from a range of nongovernmental organizations, notably
Médecins Sans Frontières, philanthropy
(the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation,
the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation,
the Skoll Foundation, and the
Wellcome Trust), governments, social
sector organizations, private sector
companies and individuals. However,
new models are needed if future
response is to be faster, more stable,
flexible and long term. To enable such
models, the private and public sectors
must jointly develop new financing

options, such as draw-down facilities,
insurance programmes and bonds.
The World Bank Group, in collaboration
with the WHO and private sector
players, including Swiss Re and
Munich Re, is developing an insurance
product that will provide early financing
to affected countries to respond to
future epidemics (see Box 3.3.3).
Such initiatives and incentives could
be linked with the willingness of
governments to invest sustainably
and in a verifiable way in critical public
health infrastructure.

becomes ever more complex and
our interdependency grows, it is
clear that new equitable approaches,
technologies and innovative community
and business models, and response
strategies and financing mechanisms
will increasingly be needed to contain
known and unknown threats that
endanger social and economic stability
worldwide. There must also be better
mechanisms in place to manage risks
through international cooperation,
involving both the public and private
sectors beyond the traditional
healthcare industry.

Conclusion
The Ebola crisis has put the spotlight
on the importance of reducing the
vulnerability of societies to infectious
disease threats. As public health

Three Initiatives to Mitigate
the Risk and Impact of
Global Disease Outbreaks
1. Building Resilient Health Systems
Part 2
Part 3

As highlighted most recently by the
Ebola crisis, a single and localized
outbreak can put national and even
international health systems at risk if
they are unprepared to react quickly.
The world will remain vulnerable to
public health emergencies until every
state has comprehensive primary
care services, an adequate number
of healthcare workers, available
medicines, robust health information
systems, infrastructure, public financing
and a strong government to deliver
equitable and high-quality services to
all its citizens.

Part 4

During and in the aftermath of an
outbreak, health systems become
more vulnerable to new crises. For
example, in November 2014 fewer than
half of the health facilities in Liberia
were seeing patients; the government
estimates that from May to August
2014, skilled birth attendance was
27% below 2013 levels, measles
immunization was down 50% and
overall health services were operating
at 40% lower capacity. Even in areas
where essential health services
have begun to resume, the loss of
these services during the height of
the epidemic continues to have an
impact.21
During the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP)’s International
Ebola Recovery Conference in July
2015, the international community
pledged funds to build robust health
systems to “get to zero and stay at
zero” in the Ebola-affected countries.
However, it took a global health threat
and close to 11,000 deaths to create
this momentum.
One challenge to strengthening health
systems is that very few programmes
address the entire system. No single
innovation or player can allow an entire
system to leapfrog in the way that,
in the telecommunications industry
for example, mobile phones made it
unnecessary to establish expensive
infrastructure for landlines.22 The WHO
has identified six building blocks of
64

The Global Risks Report 2016

health systems; most strengthening
interventions address only one of these
blocks. Some target health worker
training; others focus on demand
financing and insurance schemes;
still others aim to improve service
delivery and access to medicines and
technologies. Although all these efforts
lead to meaningful improvements, their
impact remains limited because they
do not address all dimensions of the
health system in a synchronized and
synergistic way.
It is critical to understand the most
efficient way for all health stakeholders
to collaborate. An extensive
analysis of successful innovations
in emerging economies has shown
that well-thought-out ecosystems of
partnerships can significantly improve
the impact and financial sustainability of
health initiatives.
Ogun State in Nigeria, for instance,
is pioneering an ecosystem of
partnerships that synchronizes all
projects and programmes in primary
service delivery, creating a model that
will increase low-income individuals’
access to basic healthcare that can be
replicated in other Nigerian states.
The World Economic Forum supported
the state’s Commissioner of Health in
convening private and public sector
stakeholders that together defined the
priorities and mapped out partners
that could contribute in a synergistic
way. Projects include a statesubsidized insurance scheme, work on
modernizing transport and logistics,
upgraded equipment, improved
sourcing of basic medical products,
and a community-based primary care
facility model with elements of publicprivate partnership. The intervention is
coordinated by a project management
unit funded and managed by African
Health Markets for Equity in partnership
with governments, foundations and
private sector players from across
industries.
The programme is the first of its kind
in aiming to build the resilience of an
entire health system. Although still in
its early stages, it has already won
Nigeria’s Excellence Award for 2015,
which recognizes efforts in healthcare
delivery.

2. Harmonizing Public-Private
Networks: The Key for Early
Detection and Response
Coordination and time are invaluable
assets in an emergency, so
mechanisms that bring together
public and private players in high-risk
geographies to address emerging
epidemics are likely to pay dividends.
Although response measures remain
primarily international, harnessing the
potential of national and local actors to
optimize early detection and response
on the ground is also critical.
Local actors or in-country operators
(multinationals and small or mediumsized enterprises) have the greatest
incentive to act swiftly in any outbreak
or epidemic.23 They are motivated
not only by responsibility to their
communities but also by a desire to
protect their operations, maintain
business continuity and reduce
business risks. Embedded in their
communities, and often operating
in remote areas with little public
infrastructure, they are likely to see
emerging public health issues at
an early stage. They also have the
capacity to raise an alert in the event of
an emerging threat.
The potential of private sector actors
to contribute in an emergency was
prominently witnessed in the Ebola
crisis. Although several multinationals
chose to shut down their operations
and leave the area, many others –
along with domestic businesses
– maintained their presence and
contributed meaningfully to the
response through channels such as the
Ebola Private Sector Mobilizing Group
(EPSMG). In-country operators such as
ArcelorMittal conducted initiatives on
community awareness and screening
programmes, and used their machinery
and capacity to construct Ebola
Treatment Centres. Alcoa educated
its employees and their families on the
transmission of Ebola and taught them
how to protect themselves. Firestone
built its own isolation and treatment
centre in its facility after a case was
detected and nearby hospitals were
unable to accommodate the patient.
Beyond funding and in-kind donations,
local actors also played an important
role in influencing decision-makers
and mobilizing each other: the Sierra

Part 1

Although these and many similar efforts
deserve and have received recognition,
a lack of coordination limited the ability
of the private sector to apply its full set
of capabilities, and their interactions
were not aligned with public sector
efforts on a day-to-day basis. Local
companies did not always know how
best to contribute to the response, and
national governments and responding
agencies were not always aware of
potential opportunities to partner with
the local private sector.

One key to determining how viruses
spread is to understand how people
move around and interact with one
another on a daily basis. Big data
allows the modelling of how a virus
spreads, and the potential for it to
be contained by various possible
interventions.

With subsequent endorsement from
partners including the United Nations,
the African Development Bank and
the Wellcome Trust, the Forum has
launched a 12-month initiative to
mobilize in-country business operators
and facilitate dialogue with ministries
of health for the local implementation
of networks in national preparedness
and response schemes. This entails
the creation of country-wide playbooks
and communication platforms between
local actors across sectors to develop
a rapid and efficient response in the
event of an epidemic. Networks and
their implementation roadmaps will
be designed for specific high-risk
geographies including Mali, Guinea,
Liberia and Nigeria, with the vision

The 2009 H1N1 Swine Flu pandemic
response in Mexico is an early
example of how mobile phone data
can be used. As the outbreak began
to spread, the Mexican government
acted to limit the movement of people,
advising them to stay away from public
places such as airports, hospitals and
universities. A digital research team
in Telefónica, one of Mexico’s largest
mobile network providers, saw an
opportunity to test the effectiveness
of the advice by analysing patterns of
movement. Drawing from anonymized
mobile phone call records of 1 million
customers in one of Mexico’s most
affected cities, the team found that call
traffic was lower or stable in hospitals
and universities but increasing at the
airport, suggesting that people were
ignoring government advice and trying
to leave the area.
Next, the team created a model to
simulate what would have happened
if the government had not intervened.
Analysing more than five months of
encrypted call records, including the
period of government interventions,
the research team found that the
intervention had resulted in between
a 10% and 30% drop in movement,
postponed the peak of the epidemic
by nearly two days and reduced the
number of infections by 10%.24

The Ebola crisis also saw innovative
attempts to use technology to predict,
detect and prevent new cases, such
as the mHero platform – supported
by a consortium of partners including
UNICEF, UNAIDS and IntraHealth –
to connect ministries of health with
frontline workers using text messaging
services and analyse the resulting data.
However, the lack of interoperability
of data information systems between
responders in the crisis highlighted the
need to review new fabric architecture,
diagnostics and logistics. The mHero
platform is under development to
overcome these barriers.26
Finding the fastest and most efficient
channel to disseminate information is
key to fighting an infectious disease
outbreak, and access to data for realtime monitoring, multi-path surveys
and detailed analysis is essential.
The better the information, the more
sure decision-makers can be of their
strategy. Real-time sharing of data in a
coordinated and collaborative manner
can make responses more efficient.
If ways can be found to reconcile the
need for data with current regulatory
environments and the legitimate right
to data privacy, lessons from the Ebola
crisis could potentially be applied in
future emergency settings.

A more recent intervention has
been witnessed in the use of GPS
technology in the roll-out of treatmentas-prevention to control the HIV
pandemic in Sub-Saharan Africa to
construct predictive prevalence maps
for migrating populations.25 Health
workers can immediately report newly
identified cases through solar radios

Building on the flexible partnership
responses that complemented
the channels of official assistance
to Ebola-affected countries, the
Forum has drawn up a wide set of
recommendations for public-private
cooperation models to manage
any potential future outbreaks more
effectively and reduce the risk of their
occurrence. The study disaggregates
private sector interventions into three
categories – in-country operators,
expert capability companies and
greater private sector contributors –
and makes specific recommendations
for each category to enhance
collaboration. At a high-level dialogue in

a desire to home in on optimizing local

plans.

Zoonoses – pathogenic organisms such as bacteria or viruses that humans share
with animals – cause more than 60% of human infectious diseases and have been
responsible for some of the most devastating disease outbreaks in recent years,
including HIV, Ebola and SARS. See http://www.thelancet.com/series/zoonoses.

Estimates suggest that in the United States at least 2 million people acquire serious
infections with bacteria that are resistant to one or more of the antibiotics designed
to treat them, and at least 23,000 people die each year as a direct result of these
antibiotic-resistant infections. Estimates of economic costs range as high as US$20
billion in excess direct healthcare costs, with additional costs to society for lost
productivity as high as US$35 billion a year (2008 dollars). See http://www.tufts.edu/

Part 4:
Risks for Doing
Business at a
Glance

Building resilience against global risks
necessitates consensus in identifying
the risks that should most concern
different stakeholders across regions
and countries. The final part of The
Global Risks Report therefore focuses
on the impact of global risks on the
business community across different
regions and countries. It draws on the
views of executives in 140 economies
covered by the World Economic
Forum’s Executive Opinion Survey
(see Box 4.1) about the risks of highest
concern for doing business.1

Part 3

The fact that today’s businesses are
global is not news, but the extent
of the globalization of trade and
commerce – and the risks it presents
– is far from understood. Foreign direct
investment (FDI) inflows have increased
a staggering 25-fold since 1980, rising
from US$54 billion to US$1.23 trillion
in 2014,2 as marked by shifts from
manufacturing to services and from
developed to developing and emerging
markets. Indeed, South-South
investments (that is, investments from
one developing economy to another)
have intensified, growing by twothirds, from US$1.7 trillion in 2009 to
US$2.9 trillion in 2013.3 Information and
communications technologies (ICTs)
have internationalized supply chains,
linking trade and investment ever more
tightly.4 While offering companies
opportunities to lower production costs
and countries the chance to develop
economically by participating in global
value chains, the internationalization of
business increases exposure to global
risks. From environmental to economic
and political risks, companies are
vulnerable even if they have no
immediate presence in the geography
where the risk arises.5 The resilience
of any individual business depends
heavily on the resilience of its suppliers
and purchasers, whose supply chains
can span many countries.

Part 4

Increasingly, businesses need
to strengthen their scenario and
emergency planning capacity to
analyse complex and often uncertain
interdependencies if they are to build
resilience to global risks. Likewise,
countries also need to understand the
global risks to doing business. Globally,
FDI inflows fell by 16%, from US1.47$
trillion in 2013 to US1.23$ trillion in 2014
– well below the pre-crisis 2007 peak –

for reasons that include perceptions of
global economic fragility, government
policy uncertainty and elevated
geopolitical risks.6

Box 4.1: The World Economic Forum’s Executive Opinion Survey

Part 2

Every year since 1979, the World Economic Forum has conducted its Executive
Opinion Survey (EOS). Capturing executives’ perspectives on a broad range of
socio-economic issues, the EOS primarily informs the World Economic Forum’s
annual Global Competitiveness Report and its derivatives. The 2015 edition of the
EOS, conducted between February and June 2015, surveyed over 13,000
executives in 140 economies. EOS respondents were asked to select the five
global risks that they were most concerned about for doing business in their
country within the next 10 years, choosing from the set of 28 global risks
presented in the The Global Risks Report 2015.1 See Appendix C for details of the
methodology and the EOS.

This part of The Global Risk Report
2016 therefore aims to provide insight
for both business and policy-makers by
drawing on the findings of the Forum’s
Executive Opinion Survey (EOS) about
the risks for doing business in 140
economies. It takes the global risks
discussed in previous chapters to the
country level and analyses regional
trends, country-specific responses and
presents deep-dives into the five oftencited risks of highest concern.

Part 3

Note
1
Following an expert review in spring 2015, the set of risks was increased from 28 to 29 global risks in this
year’s Report. Formerly part of the risk of national governance, illicit trade is now treated as a separate global
risk. See Appendix B for details regarding the difference in the list of global risks from last year and this
edition.

Regional Analysis
central role in production processes,
service provision and everyday life. In
emerging and developing economies,
the top concern is unemployment and
underemployment as well as potential
energy price shocks.
A striking finding is the relative absence
of environmental risks and, more
generally, of long-term issues among
the top concerns of business leaders
in their respective countries. For

instance, no executive considers failure
of climate mitigation and adaptation
as the number one risk for doing
business in his/her country. This stands
in contrast to the priorities considered
by members of the multistakeholder
community of the World Economic
Forum who took part in the Global
Risks Perception Survey and perceived
it as the most impactful and the third
most likely risk on a global scale (see
Figure 1). This finding highlights the

Part 4

The risks of highest concern for
doing business differ considerably
from country to country, according to
EOS data. However, some patterns
emerge. In developed economies,
economic risks such as asset bubbles
and fiscal crises are high on the
business agenda; concern is also
present about technological risks
such as cyberattacks and data theft.
In these economies, it is increasingly
evident that connectivity plays a

divergence between national and
global interests when it comes to some
global risks such as climate change.
It also calls for continued alignment
across stakeholders whose actions are
based on different time horizons.
The top global risks for doing business
for each country are shown in Figure
4.1. Full economy-level data are
available at www.weforum.org/risks.
Throughout Part 4, the ranking of risks
refers exclusively to the EOS question
on risks of highest concern for doing
business.7

Europe

Part 4

Across Europe,8 the risks that
stand out as being of great concern
for doing business are all in an
economic category. Unemployment
or underemployment is mentioned as
the risk of highest concern for doing
business in 12 countries in Europe
and is among the top five risks in 25
countries (Table 4.1).

where more than half of youth are
unemployed;10 and in the Balkans, with
unemployment sky-rocketing in Serbia
and Bosnia and Herzegovina.11 Along
with challenges related to involuntary
migration, high unemployment rates
may help to explain why the risk of
profound social instability also features
prominently in Southern and Eastern
Europe.

ranks second globally for online
business-to-consumer transactions.14
The risk of terrorist attacks is third on
the list (and 13th in Canada): according
to the House Committee on Homeland
Security, the home-grown Islamist
extremist threat in the United States
has escalated dramatically in 2015, with
more terror cases than in any full year
since September 11, 2011.15

The risk of an asset bubble is the top
concern in Iceland, Luxembourg,
Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom.
A related economic risk causing
concern across Europe is fiscal crises
(this is the risk of highest concern in
four countries and is among the top
five in 26 countries); although fiscal
consolidations are starting to pay
off, government debt in advanced
economies is projected to aggregate at
104.2% of GDP in 2016, much higher
than the pre-crisis level of 71.6% in
2007.12

Although the extent of concern about
cyberattacks is somewhat lower than
the above-mentioned risks (this risk is
among the top five of highest concern
in 12 countries), it is of high concern in
Estonia, Germany, the Netherlands and
Switzerland. Given the cross-border
nature of cyberspace, there is obvious
potential for cyberattacks to have
ramifications well beyond the countries
in which they occur.

Unemployment threatens to de-skill an
entire generation in parts of Europe,
further aggravating businesses’ search
for employees with the right type of
skills to compete in today’s fast-paced
global economy. These concerns are
not limited to the crisis-hit Southern
European economies – such as
Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Portugal and
Spain – where unemployment remains
well into the double digits eight years
after the crisis, well beyond a typical
business cycle. They are also strong in
countries such as Austria, Finland and
France, where unemployment rates are
considerably lower although historically

The Global Risks Report 2016

In North America, which includes
the United States and Canada, two
risks have been selected as being
among the five of highest concern
for doing business in both countries:
cyberattacks and asset bubbles
(Table 4.2).
In the United States, the top risk is
cyberattack, followed by data fraud
or theft (the latter is in 7th position
in Canada, which is why it scores
50% in Table 4.2). Interestingly, the
risks related to the internet and cyber
dependency are considered to be of
highest concern for doing business,
following recent important attacks
on businesses. The United States is
extremely well connected, and ICT
usage is high – 87% of the population

Energy price shock to the global
economy tops the list of concerns in
Canada, with the commodity price
drop hurting the Canadian economy
and GDP growth projected to be
around 1% in 2015, compared with
2.4% in 2014.16 The risks of asset
bubble and cyberattacks come second
and third in Canada (fifth and first in the
United States, respectively).
Asia and the Pacific
Central Asia and Russia
The end of the commodity boom,
the economic slowdown in Russia,
the weaker-than-expected growth
in China and the slow recovery in
the Eurozone are among the factors
putting pressures on Central Asia’s
economies.17 Although the region’s
countries feature a diverse range of
risks of highest concern for doing
business, the most prominent are
fiscal crises, unmanageable inflation,
interstate conflicts and unemployment
and underemployment (Table 4.3).

Fiscal crises is among the five most
concerning risks for 41% of executives
in the region. The slowdown of the
Chinese economy is likely to moderate
growth and could negatively impact
public finances in neighbouring
countries.21 Along with these two
risks, cyberattacks – the risk of highest
concern for doing business in three
economies – is further explored in the
deep-dives below.

A combination of factors could explain
the fear of unmanageable inflation
in several of the region’s countries.
These factors include the recent
volatility in foreign exchange markets,
with regional currencies depreciating
against the US dollar and reserve
losses;18 a second factor is the relatively
recent experience of hyperinflation
during the 1990s transition period;19
and a third is the concern that weak
institutions will be unable to implement
the deep structural and fiscal reforms
necessary to foster sustainable growth.

Table 4.4: East Asia and the Pacific:
Percentage of Economies in which a

Highest Concern for Doing Business

The dispute between Russia and
Ukraine, the annexation of Crimea,
and Russian military intervention in
Syria are among many geopolitical
developments in the region that may
be affecting the views of business
executives who mentioned the risk
of an interstate conflict with regional
consequences.

Percent

South Asia
With four of the region’s countries
identifying energy price shock and
three economies identifying fiscal
crises among their top five, concern for
doing business is centred on economic
risks (Table 4.5).23 Unemployment and
underemployment is also among the
most-cited risks in South Asia, with
the whole region facing the challenge
of jobless growth and vulnerable and
informal employment: vulnerable
employment accounted for over threequarters of all employment in 2014 in
South Asia.24 Youth unemployment
is also a concern, especially in South
Asia, where the rate is already four
times higher than among adults and an
additional 2.1 million youth will enter the
labour force over the next five years.25

Oil-exporting countries are suffering
from lower prices and volumes of trade,
which negatively affects government
revenues; and while the lower price
is helping the region’s oil importers, it
is unlikely to make up for the effects
on fiscal balances of weak domestic
demand and Russia’s economic
contraction. Rising public debt helps
to explain why fiscal crises are one
of the top three concerns in all the
region’s countries. With only moderate
economic prospects, unemployment
is likely to surge in the region and is
among the top five risks of highest
concern in five countries.

Nargis, respectively.22 Executives
are concerned about the region’s
vulnerability to natural catastrophes
– earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic
eruptions and geomagnetic storms –
as well as man-made environmental
catastrophes, emphasizing the
importance for business of sustainable
development that respects the
environment. In New Zealand, the
most worrisome risk for executives is
natural catastrophes, reflecting that the
country’s position on the Alpine Fault
makes it vulnerable to earthquakes
and tsunamis. The region’s need to
build resilience against climate and
weather risks could also help to explain
why risks such as failure of critical
infrastructure and national governance
rank high in some of the economies.

East Asia and the Pacific
The global risks of highest concern for
doing business in East Asia and the
Pacific are mainly economic: energy
price shock and asset bubble (Table
4.4).20 While energy price shock tops
the list only in Lao PDR and Indonesia,
it is among the top five in 12 countries.
Many countries in the region are energy
importers and soaring prices could
be damaging. The risk of an asset
bubble ranks top in seven economies
(Australia, Cambodia, China, Hong
Kong SAR, Myanmar, New Zealand
and Thailand), reflecting the recent
equity market turmoil in China and
potential spillovers into the other
countries from the region as well as
over-evaluation of property in some of
the economies such as Hong Kong or
Sydney.

Failure of national governance is
another leading concern, highlighting
the difficulties posed for business in the
region by the current unstable political
situation: for instance, according to the
Corruption Perception Index, Nepal
ranks 126th and Bangladesh 145th out
of 175 economies.26

Failure of national governance is
a prominent concern across Latin
America and the Caribbean,27
especially in South America,
where corruption and mistrust in
the functioning of institutions are
increasingly compounding the
difficulties of running a business (Table
4.6). The region’s weak economic
growth prospects and low levels
of investment lie behind concerns
about failure of critical infrastructure;28
increasing investment in infrastructure
would stimulate the economy as well as
strengthen resilience to global risks.

The region relies heavily on exports
of commodities that have declined in
price – such as oil, gas, copper and
iron – explaining the prominence of the
risk of an energy price shock among
the region’s leading concerns. Low
commodity prices reinforce existing
challenges such as high public debt
and low economic growth, and
increasing the associated risk of fiscal
crises.
Finally, concerns about unemployment
reflect how skills mismatch and rigid
labour markets are affecting business
development in the region.

a proliferation of conflicts is putting the
region’s geopolitical stability at stake.

Middle East and North Africa
Executives in oil-exporting countries
in the Middle East and North Africa
are most concerned about the risk
of an energy price shock (the top
concern in nine countries) (Table 4.7),29
with low prices already leading to a
decline of exports and revenue, hurting
public finances, undermining financial
planning and ultimately threatening to
expose often-insufficient diversification
of the economy.

Sub-Saharan Africa
By 2035, Sub-Saharan Africa is
projected to have more young
people reaching working age than
the rest of the world put together.34
This demographic pressure helps
to explain why unemployment and
underemployment is the most
concerning risk for executives in the
region. Creating high-productivity,
non-agricultural jobs is among the
region’s biggest challenges, requiring
businesses to adapt and diversify.
Failure to reform Sub-Saharan Africa’s
labour market could fuel social
instability, another widespread concern
according to survey respondents (Table

Unemployment or underemployment,
especially among youth, is also of
high concern in the region, with youth
unemployment as high as 33% in
Jordan (2013 data) and above 20%
in Oman, Saudi Arabia, and Algeria.30
Informal employment is a growing
trend,31 adding to the potential for the
job market situation to fuel profound
social instability – a risk that makes
the top five in five countries amid a
regional humanitarian crisis that sees
neighbouring countries coping with
refugees from Syria. One in four of
the world’s refugees is now Syrian,
with 95% located in surrounding
countries;32 in Lebanon, over a fifth of
the population is refugees. Another
potential cause of social disruption is
water crises (among the top five risks
in four countries), a particular concern
for business because water is a key
input in many industries,33 agricultural
products and energy production.
Unsurprisingly, the risks of terrorist
attacks and interstate conflict also
weigh on the minds of executives, as

Percent

Note: 33 economies considered

With fiscal pressures increasing for oil
and gas exporters, the risk of energy
price shock is prominent in executives’
thinking. The aggregated benefits
of lower prices for the region’s oil
importers are likely to be offset by falls
in the prices of other commodities that
they export.35 The macroeconomic
climate is a related concern, especially
fiscal crises and inflationary pressures.
Africa’s urban population is expected
to triple by 2025,36 as reflected in the
prominence of the risk of failure of
urban planning and pointing to the
need for more investment in urban
infrastructure. This helps to explain why
failure of critical infrastructure is another
high-ranking risk: lack of infrastructure
– both physical and virtual – is

in 41 countries, and is among the top
five global risks in 92 countries (Figure
4.2). Unemployment affects business
in multiple ways, from holding back
economic growth to threatening social
stability. With a growing mismatch
between the skills demanded by a
fast-changing jobs market and those
possessed by unemployed workers,
businesses are struggling to recruit
workers with the capabilities they need.
Expected job growth is concentrated in
occupations for which today’s workers
are inadequately prepared.
Structural unemployment has
increased in all major economies since
the 2007 crisis. Even where growth
has picked up, labour productivity and
job creation often have not. Layoffs
disproportionately affected middleskilled jobs, while most job creation in
the recovery has taken place in lower-

Given the unprecedented nature and
pace of these displacements, largescale reforms will be needed, both
by government and business. Shortterm, reactive measures based on
past successes will not be enough: for
example, efforts to place unemployed
youth in apprenticeships in certain
job categories may not be a highvalue investment if that job category
is likely to be obsolete in five years’
time as a result of automation or other
disruptions, while growth comes from
wholly new occupations. Three main
reforms are needed.
First, the education systems must be
redesigned to focus on learning to
learn and collaboration. As knowledgebased work will increasingly be
handled by technology, we need to
educate future generations in skills
where humans can still be expected to
outperform machines – collaborationbased attributes such as teamwork,
interaction, relationships and cultural
sensitivity. In a more automated future,
value will come from emotional and
contextual intelligence.

Between them, two economic risks
account for the global risks of most
concern for doing business in half
of the 140 economies covered:
unemployment or underemployment,
and energy price shock. Third on the
list is failure of national governance,
which affects businesses in many
ways, including the failure to stamp out

technological disruptions and the move
towards automation are accelerating

it is estimated that by the year 2020
nearly half of all current occupations
could be affected by advances in
robotics and machine learning.39

Deep-Dives into Five
Global Risks

The below deep-dives into the
implications for business also explore
asset bubbles, fourth on the global
list, and cyberattacks, among the top
three risks in 18 economies. While
not exhaustive, these analyses of
mechanisms through which these
global risks affect businesses at the
national level are intended to raise
awareness of the need for action.

Part 1
Part 2
Part 3

Second, while businesses must work
with educators and governments
to help education systems keep up
with the needs of the labour market,
companies must also fundamentally
re-think their role as consumers of
ready-made human capital, obtaining
pre-trained talent from schools,
universities and other companies.
Some companies understand this and
are investing more in the continuous
learning, re-skilling and up-skilling of
their employees. Given the ongoing
rapid changes in the skill sets
required for many occupations, talent
management is no longer the preserve
of the human resources function but
will be a critical part of any company’s
growth and innovation strategy –
especially with younger cohorts of
workers increasingly valuing a sense of
purpose and diversity of experiences in
their working lives.

Part 4

Third, governments must look beyond
the education system to redesign the
broader enabling environment for
talent. Human capital development
depends on a series of interventions
across a person’s lifetime, including
hiring and firing practices, women’s
integration, retirement policies, visa
regulations, social safety nets, and,
in particular, regulatory support for
entrepreneurship and small and
medium-sized enterprises – one of
the most under-utilized means of
unleashing creativity, enhancing growth
and generating employment. Such
areas often go neglected by policy-

makers because reforms are unlikely to
pay off within the timeframe of political
tenures.
Energy Price Shocks to the Global
Economy
With lower oil prices making the
headlines recently, the risk of energy
price shocks to the global economy
ranks first in 29 out of the 140
economies represented in the 2015
EOS and appears in the top five risks in
93 of them (Figure 4.3).
“Price shocks” can refer to either
sudden increases or decreases in the
price of energy – whether in the form of
electricity, oil, natural gas or liquid fuels
derived from these sources. From 2010
until June 2014 world oil prices were
fairly stable, at around $110 a barrel
for Brent crude; since then they have
ranged between around US$45 to
US$60, a plunge that surprised many.
Natural gas prices, often indexed to
oil, have followed a similar trajectory.
This has resulted in significant shifts
of wealth from oil and gas producers
to consumers, meaning lower input
costs for industry, lower inflation and
more money available to spend in other
sectors.
The outlook for oil prices is uncertain.
On the supply side, one key factor is
whether or not the Organization of
the Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) – and in particular Saudi Arabia
– will continue with its strategy of not

curtailing production despite price
declines. Another factor is the extent to
which investment will fall in response
to low prices, leading to a potential rise
in unemployment rate of oil-exporting
countries. Key oil and gas producers
are estimated to have cut over US$200
billion in capital expenditure on new
projects, deferring oil and gas projects
with reserves equating to 20 billion
barrels of oil equivalent.40
If current low prices continue, the
implications for oil-exporting countries
may be severe. For instance, oil export
losses in 2015 are expected to reach
about US$300 billion in the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC),41 which will
have a heavy impact on governments’
budget balances. The International
Monetary Fund expects more than 10
million people to be looking for work
by 2020 in the region’s oil-exporting
countries, which will challenge fiscal
sustainability over the medium term.
A combination of rising import prices
hurting the populations of many
oil-producing countries and a lack of
job opportunities may lead to social
instability.42
Whether demand for oil picks up
depends on factors such as whether
growth recovers in China and other
emerging economies, as well as the
extent to which economies become
less fuel intensive as a consequence
of new technology and energyefficiency measures. It is possible
that if prices start to recover, they

current low prices leading to reduced
investment and job losses, there is
less slack in the system to deal with
unanticipated demand increases.43

Part 4

Failure of national governance is
perceived as the highest risk to
doing business by executives in 14
economies – half of them in Latin
America, four in Sub-Saharan Africa,
two in Eastern Europe and one in Asia

Businesses face additional risks
as well as costs from operating in
countries affected by poor governance.
Both the risks and the costs arise
from the difficulties of working in
an unpredictable environment and
complying with international standards
when fragile governments do not
themselves adhere to international
regulatory regimes. These costs

One aspect of poor governance – illicit
trade – can undermine corporate
brands and supply chains, because
logistics and transport sectors often
unwittingly contribute to the spread of
illicit goods. Illicit trade is estimated to
cost the world economy up to US$2
trillion, although it is difficult to quantify
accurately.46 Counterfeiting and piracy
alone are estimated to amount to
US$1.77 trillion in 2015,47 nearly 10% of
world merchandise trade.48

Part 3

Failure of National Governance

As discussed in the most recent
edition of the World Economic
Forum’s Global Competitiveness
Report, the consequences of failures
of governance seriously undermine
many countries’ competitiveness, job
creation and economic development.
Weak or failing national governance
creates space for organized criminals
and terrorists to profit from illegal
trading in humans, weapons,
counterfeit goods, and so on. The
cross-sector and transnational nature
of these illegal activities means they
pose a risk to all, creating economic,
social, and environmental damage at
regional and global levels.

can be serious enough to become
unsustainable in the long run.

Part 2

Such a price spike could lead to slower
global output and disrupt business
models. Even many developed
countries are vulnerable – for example,
geopolitical tensions threaten energy
security in Europe, which gets around
a quarter of its gas from Russia.44 Still,
the risks of a price spike destabilizing
society are greatest in less-developed
economies, which are highly
dependent on imports and have little
scope for alternatives to take up the
slack. Indeed, the risks associated
with an undiversified energy sector
are not limited to oil – for example,
in 2008 water shortages caused by
an extremely harsh winter impacted
energy production in Tajikistan,
which relies heavily on hydro power.
Ramifications in that instance included
interruptions in medical care for many
people (power shortages and cold
weather deprived more than 50% of
the country’s hospitals of their water
supply).45

(Figure 4.4). This risk captures the
inability to efficiently govern a nation,
which is caused by or results in factors
such as weak rule of law, corruption,
illicit trade, organized crime, impunity,
and political deadlock. Weak national
government is not the result only of
poor governance; governance is a
multi-faceted phenomenon in which
business, civil society and the general
public also play roles.

DNA analysis. A genetic library

laboratories are able to link stolen
ivory to specific animals.53
Encryption: Although organized
criminals use encryption to evade
detection, it can also be used
to enable the secure sharing
of information between law
enforcement organizations and the
private sector.

Part 4

Individual companies can take some
steps to protect their own operations,
reputation or assets – but for
businesses to build resilience against
the risk of failure of national governance
ultimately requires finding ways to
contribute towards improving the
overall situation. That includes setting
an example for political leaders by
upholding international best practice,
frameworks and standards, and
looking for ways to collaborate with
governments and civil society on the
development of more coherent policies
and smart governance strategies.
It is clear that the problem cannot
be resolved with policies alone, but
requires the support of the business
sector as well as awareness of the
general public. Discussions need to
move beyond political commitment –
the public sector, private sector and
civil society need to come together

to build relationships, initiatives and
mechanisms to curb the rates of illicit
trade.
Asset Bubble
Executives in 11 economies, mostly
in Europe and Asia, rate asset
bubbles as their highest concern; it
ranks among the top five risks in 40
countries, representing more than
half of the world GDP (Figure 4.5).
Far from affecting only speculators,
the bursting of asset bubbles hits
businesses across the whole economy
– particularly where leverage induces
contagion through the banking system.
As business confidence falls, so do
consumption, incomes and investment,
which can lead to a prolonged
recession.
The trigger for the global financial
crisis, to take one example, was a
widespread default on US subprime
mortgages and loss of value of related
securities. The bursting of the dotcom bubble in 2000–2002 destroyed
US$5 trillion of stock market wealth in
the United States (equivalent to half of
annual GDP) in 30 months.54 Japan
was mired in a low-growth deflationary
environment for over two decades
after this combined real estate and
stock market bubbles burst in the early
1990s.
Recent global economic developments
have increased both the likelihood and
potential impact of bubbles. In many

countries, monetary and fiscal policy
after the financial crisis of 2007–2008
had some success in stimulating the
economy to minimize the depth of the
recession. However, as post-recession
growth proved elusive, easy monetary
policy was maintained or even stepped
up. Low interest rates sent investors
on a search for yield, creating an
environment that is highly conducive to
bubbles. The impact of another bubble
bursting now in a major economy
would be especially damaging
because the weakness of the recovery
and high levels of government debt
mean there would be little remaining
policy space for further stimulus.
Asset bubbles can never be identified
with certainty while they are building
up, as there is always a narrative of
“this time is different”. Nonetheless,
when attempting to evaluate the risk
of a bubble bursting, three types of
potential bubbles can be distinguished:
–

Equity bubbles. These bubbles
are often a side effect of low
interest rates, as investors look
to stock markets for higher yields
than they can get from fixed
income assets. Companies can
use their highly-valued stock to
make cross-border acquisitions
– but when the bubble bursts,
they can in turn become takeover
targets for companies in other
countries.

–

The bursting of any of these three
types of bubble can tip an economy
into recession. For consumer-facing
businesses without regional or global
diversification, this is a concern that is
not easily mitigated. Besides shoring
up the balance sheet – for example, by
issuing long-dated debt – and putting
adequate credit lines in place, most
mitigation mechanisms would be
more strategic and affect the business
model, such as alliances to tap more
diversified markets.

From personal finances to business
operations and national infrastructure,
public and private services and
amenities are increasingly managed via
some form of computer network and
are consequently vulnerable to attack.
The Internet of Things is a growing
reality, introducing new efficiencies
as well as new vulnerabilities and
interconnected consequences. Recent
technological advances have been
beneficial in many respects, but have

Attempts to detect and address attacks
are made harder by their constantly
evolving nature, as perpetrators quickly
find new ways of executing them.

Cyberattacks

The EOS results indicate that
cyberattack is perceived as the
risk of highest concern in eight
economies: Estonia, Germany, Japan,
Malaysia, the Netherlands, Singapore,
Switzerland, and the United States.
Public sector bodies in at least two of
these countries have recently been
disrupted by cyberattacks: the US
Office of Personnel Management and
the Japanese Pension Service. The
2015 Fortune 500 CEO survey found
that cyber security came second
when CEOs were asked about their
companies’ biggest challenges.57

Part 3

From a policy perspective, some
studies suggest that the development
of financial markets – with increased
integration, sophistication of trading
techniques, and removal of frictions
to arbitrage – may be increasing the
prevalence of bubbles.55 A fundamental
rethink of regulation and contract
design in financial markets could be
necessary, to accept the inevitability of
bubbles and seek to limit their scope.

also opened the door to a growing
wave of cyberattacks – including
economic espionage, cybercrime, and
even state-sponsored exploits – that
are increasingly perpetrated against
businesses (Figure 4.6). In 2014, The
Center for Strategic and International
Studies and McAfee estimated that
cybercrime alone cost the global
economy US$ 445 billion.56 Businesses
in all industries and of all sizes have
been affected by the increased
complexity, novelty and persistence
of cyberattacks, with consequences
ranging from the reputational to
economic and legal. A sharp increase
in high-profile cases in 2014 has
continued into 2015, and shows no
sign of slowing down.

Part 2

–

Real estate bubbles. Real estate
bubbles are not usually a major
concern for companies while they
are inflating, though they make
office and factory space more
expensive. However, because
banks play a major role in real
estate finance, the bursting of
a real estate bubble can have
catastrophic impacts on business
finance, as seen recently in Ireland:
with banks struggling, credit can
dry up completely and companies
find it hard to finance their
operations.
Government bond bubbles.
Government bonds might be
inflated by a quantitative easing
of purchases by central banks
and new liquidity requirements
increasing demand among private
sector banks. As prices are
pushed up, yields go down, which
drives investors into higher-yield
corporate bonds, raising the risk
of a bubble here, too. In the short
term, this can be good news for
corporate issuers – but the ending
of quantitative easing programmes
could rapidly make it harder for
businesses to raise capital. Some
observers have raised concerns
about whether current market
structures can deal with the
resulting large swings in demand
for bonds, potentially triggering
severe volatility in the financial
system.

Part 1
Part 2
Part 3

Businesses trying to match this speed
in their development of prevention and
response methods are sometimes
constrained by a poor understanding
of the risk, a lack of technical talent,
and inadequate security capabilities.
Although CEOs worry about rising
cyber risks, the ownership of and
responsibility for the cyber risk is less
clear. Who in the corporation is the
actual owner of the risk? While there
are many “C” level owners (CISO,
CFO, CEO, CRO, Risk Management),
each of these owners has differing but
related interests and unfortunately often
does not integrate risk or effectively
collaborate on its management.
Defining clear roles and responsibilities
for cyber risk is crucial.

Part 4

Outdated laws and regulations inhibit
governments’ ability to capture
criminals but also to expedite
the often lengthy procedure of
elaborating and implementing legal
and regulatory frameworks to reflect
evolving realities. The sophisticated
threats of government-sponsored
economic espionage also exceed
the defensive capabilities of many
commercial enterprises, which are
more and more frequently looking to
other governments to intervene. The
G-20 recently took an unexpected,
but applauded, step and collectively
affirmed “that no country should
conduct or support ICT-enabled theft
of intellectual property, including trade
secrets or other confidential business
information, with the intent of providing
competitive advantages to companies
or commercial sectors.”58
Businesses are increasingly accepting
the fact that they cannot hope to
prevent all cyberattacks. The difficulty
in preventing attacks is not outmatched
by the difficulty in identifying and
effectively mitigating them. Given
the types of vulnerabilities utilized
by attackers and their methods,
many attacks and intrusions are not
immediately discovered – some are
recognized only months and in some
cases years later. The emphasis needs
to be on streamlining mechanisms for
early detection, response and recovery,
to mitigate and better manage the
consequences – limiting the damage,
and ensuring business continuity.

78

The Global Risks Report 2016

It is also becoming clearer that
cybercrime cannot be fought
unilaterally. Although businesses can
follow standard industry practices
or adopt individually tailored ways to
deal with cybercrimes, cooperation
throughout the value chain (because
attacks can be made through supplier
systems) and with law enforcement
is also helpful, As is often the case,
however, public-private partnership
can be held back by lack of trust and
misaligned incentives. Businesses may
fear exposing their data and practices
to competitors or to law enforcement
agencies. And the private sector’s
primary interest in rapid recovery and
continuity of business operations
may not align with the public sector’s
primary interest in apprehending
and prosecuting perpetrators. In
addition, governments need to balance
their investments in cyber offensive
weapons and efforts to enhance
capabilities for cybersecurity and
defence.

Conclusions
Addressing global risks lies beyond
the capacity of individual businesses.
Businesses need to strengthen
their resilience to ensure continued
operation and survival in the face
of risks. At the same time, the clear
role for collaboration among public
and private sector actors becomes
evident, for example, to develop better
cybercrime prevention methods, to
establish cybersecurity norms for
both governments and industry, and
to align international approaches to
enforcement and establish industry
norms. Above all, it is in the key interest
of businesses to find new ways to
partner with governments to address
global risks. Many risks, ranging from
energy security to unemployment, can
only be addressed through diverse
stakeholders recognizing the need for
joint action. Such collaboration requires
the identification of key risks and
related interests and strong alignment
and robust agreement among business
and other stakeholders on the need to
address them.

Conclusions

The 11th edition of The Global Risks
Report has explored how global risks
are becoming increasingly imminent
and materializing in new and
sometimes unexpected ways. From
climate change to the imperative for
improved water governance, from
large-scale involuntary migration to
reviving growth in the Fourth Industrial
Revolution, global risks are affecting the
lives of citizens and the functioning of
institutions and economies. We now
need to move beyond mitigation to
adaptation and building resilience.
Understanding the drivers of the global
security landscape, boosting
governance and strengthening policy
agility is ever more important. Building
a better understanding of how the new
security landscape and technological
change will impact countries,
economies and peoples’ lives is,
therefore, essential for building
sustainable, resilient growth strategies
and stable societies.
Global risks remain beyond the domain
of just one actor, highlighting the need
for collaborative and multistakeholder
action – the key message that The
Global Risks Report series has
highlighted over the past decade.
Recognizing joint interests and aligning
stakeholders on key priorities across
the different areas of global risks is the
first step to make action through
collaboration happen. We hope that
this Report will contribute to
recognizing the need for action, create
an imperative towards greater
resilience, and motivate change and
concrete action towards a better future
for everyone.

Definitions

and widespread misuse of
technologies (e.g. 3D printing, artificial
intelligence, geo-engineering, synthetic
biology, etc.) was reformulated into the
risk “Adverse consequence of
technological advances”. The definition
of each risk also went through a review
process.

The Global Risks Report 2016 is based
on the same methodology adopted in
the previous year and results are
therefore largely comparable. The
Report adopts the following definitions
of global risk and trend:

The following section describes the
survey and methodology in greater
detail.

Global risk: an uncertain event or
condition that, if it occurs, can cause
significant negative impact for several
countries or industries within the next
10 years.

The Global Risks
Perceptions Survey

Trend: a long-term pattern that is
currently taking place and that could
contribute to amplifying global risks
and/or altering the relationship between
them.

The Global Risks Perception Survey
(GRPS), discussed in Part 1, is the main
instrument used to assess global risks
in this Report. The survey was
conducted between mid-September
and the end of October 2015 among
the World Economic Forum’s
multistakeholder communities of
leaders from business, government,
academia and non-governmental and
international organizations.

The list of risks and trends assessed in
the Global Risks Perception Surveys
has changed slightly. The risk “Illicit
trade” was extracted from the risk
“Failure of national governance” to
create another risk in the economic
category. Moreover, the risk “Massive

Raw responses were cleaned in order
to improve overall data quality and
completeness. All questionnaires with a
completion rate below 50% were
dropped, reducing the number of
available responses from 933 to 742.
The respondents did not provide any
information about their gender or the
sector in 3 and 49 cases, respectively,
but it was possible to infer this
information from the rest of the records
provided for the gender and for 39
cases for the sector. Similarly, 92
respondents did not indicate the region
in which they are based and 77 were
manually assigned to a region on the
basis of their country of residence.
Figure B.1 presents the profile of the
742 survey respondents remaining in
the sample. To capture the voice of
youth, the survey also targeted the

The Global Risks Report 2016

Analysis
The Global Risks Landscape 2016
(Figure 1)
Respondents were asked to assess the
likelihood and global impact of each of
the 29 risks. For each risk, they were
asked, “How likely is this risk to occur
globally within the next 10 years?” and
“What is the estimated impact globally if
this risk were to materialize? (Impact is
to be interpreted in a broad sense
beyond just economic consequences)”.
The possible answers ranged from 1
(“very unlikely” and “low” impact,
respectively) to 7 (“very likely” and “high”
impact, respectively).
Respondents were given the possibility
to choose a “Don’t know” option if they
felt unable to provide an informed
answer. Respondents could also leave
the question completely blank. For each
risk, partial responses, i.e. those
assessing only the likelihood or only the
impact, were dropped. A simple
average for both likelihood and impact
for each of the 29 global risks was
calculated on this basis. Formally, for

Similarly, for the Risks-Trends
Interconnections Map 2016
respondents had to identify up to three
trends that they consider important in
shaping the global agenda in the next
10 years and the three risks that are
driven by each of those trends. For
completeness, the two questions read
“From the list of trends below, which are
the three most important trends that will
shape global development in the next
10 years”; and “For each of the three
trends identified in [the previous
question], select up to three risks from
the list below that are most strongly
driven by these trends”. The information
thereby obtained was used to construct
the Risks-Trend Interconnections Map
2016.
In both cases, a tally was made of the
number of times each pair was cited.

Every year since 1979 the World

survey captures invaluable information
on a broad range of socio-economic
issues. In the 2015 edition, over 13,000
