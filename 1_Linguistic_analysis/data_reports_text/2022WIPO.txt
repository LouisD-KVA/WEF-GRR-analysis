innovation opportunities?
To a large extent, this is a reflection of the wide variety of factors at play. Decisions on innovation are
often complex and involve a cross-section of different stakeholders and interests. For instance, while
new scientific and technological opportunities are
endless, resources – both human and financial – are
not. Likewise, new technologies need to be weighed
up against each other, and existing models, before
investment decisions are made. And then there are
the variables that cannot be anticipated, the shocks,
emergencies and other events that can alter society’s
demand for innovation in a blink of an eye.
This process is the theme of the World Intellectual
Property Report 2022. Our aim is to shine a light on
how the decisions of various actors within innovation
ecosystems, including policymakers, researchers,
enterprises, entrepreneurs and consumers, come
together to shape the future trajectory not only of
innovation, but of economies and societies around
the world.

As the world looks to rebuild from the pandemic,
innovation has a crucial role to play in opening up
new growth possibilities and creating much needed
solutions to the common challenges that we face.
Decisions on innovation may be complex, but, as this
report highlights, it is vital that they are understood.

Organization (WIPO)

The report begins with a discussion of the main factors
that govern the direction of innovation, including the
relationship between social and private returns. While
public and private motivations are not always aligned,
the report shows that they can be leveraged effectively
for the common good.
In keeping with previous editions of this report, we
supplement this conceptual discussion with a series of
historical case studies. Through the prisms of medical
innovation during the Second World War, the evolution
of the space race, and the rise of information technology industries in East Asia, we detail the variety of
factors and stakeholders that influence the direction
of innovation and offer insights relevant to both highlyindustrialized and emerging economies.

Executive summary

What economists define as the
“direction of innovation” – the theme
of this report – is the combination or
sum of all the decisions individuals,
firms, universities and governments
make on which technological
opportunities to pursue at any one time.
It is not only a question of how
much economies invest in new
ideas. The allocation of human
and financial resources to
different innovation activities can
set the direction of innovation of
communities, countries and even
the world for decades to come.

World Intellectual Property Report 2022

The short-term direction of innovation and its implications are relatively easy to anticipate and coordinate.
For example, to face the COVID-19 pandemic, governments and companies successfully redirected innovation investment towards the discovery, approval and
mass-production of vaccines, achieving the objective in
record time. Vaccines drastically reduced the number
of deaths and helped the global economy to recover
from the pandemic-provoked slump of 2020.
The long-term impact of the direction of innovation –
in terms of both the returns or profits to companies
and the benefits, or lack of them, to society – is less
predictable. For example, it is difficult to predict which
of the technological innovations limiting climate change
will prove most effective.

Innovation has increased
exponentially over the past
100 years, with very different
technological catalysts
Over the last century, innovation decisions have cumulated in shifting technological trajectories. Technologies
related to combustion engines, transport and other
mechanical machines dominated the innovation
landscape in the early decades of the past century.
Biopharma technologies boomed thanks to pharmaceuticals in the 1930s and to biotechnologies since
the 1990s. And in the final decades of the 20th century,
there was a big shift towards information and communication technologies (ICTs) and semiconductors,
which accounted for a quarter of all patents in the 30
years between 1990 and 2010. This increase in ICT
patent share was mostly at the expense of “traditional,”
mechanical machine technologies.

Today, the direction of innovation
is at a crossroads where promising
new technologies are booming
As we enter the third decade of the 21st century,
new and powerful forces are driving the direction
of innovation in fields such as science, technology
and medicine.
Digitalization is changing the world. A wave of digitalized general-purpose technologies includes artificial intelligence (AI), predictive technologies, highly
sophisticated automation and big data. Digital generalpurpose technologies are transforming industries by
bringing in new innovators, structures, practices and
values. These technologies give rise to new industries,
such as the Internet of Things.
Digitalization has the potential to spur economic growth,
but risks exacerbating inequalities. AI, automation and
other digital general-purpose technologies can spur
economic growth when they generate innovation that
complements and enhances human productivity. But
they risk worsening economic inequality when innovation simply replaces people. They will make certain
occupations obsolete and give rise to new ones that
require different sets of skills. While they may create
leapfrogging opportunities for some less-developed
economies, others may miss out due to a lack of large
capital investments and the high-skilled labor force
necessary for these technologies to thrive.

The COVID-19 vaccine success is an innovation model
to build on. The COVID-19 pandemic generated and,
in part, accelerated demand for new technologies to
combat it. The COVID-19 crisis prompted responses to
find solutions urgently from all actors in the innovation
ecosystem – governments, the private sector, research
institutions and universities, international communities,
non-governmental organizations (NGOs), including
philanthropic foundations.

Governments must promote both the social and private
returns of innovation. They often do this by centralizing
activities and resources for innovations which affect
the public good – goods or services freely available to
all, such as national defense or pandemic prevention.
They can also be the main source of demand for innovative technologies. Governments will design policies
to influence the provision of public goods related to
health, security or education.

experience or their supply chains. Knowledge and

In some cases, usually those economies in the middleincome bracket, innovation ecosystems may unblock
unprecedented innovative ability by leveraging scientific capacity, technological capital and skilled labor to
narrow the technological gap between them and the
most advanced economies.
In the case of the IT industry in East Asia, for example,
Japan, the Republic of Korea and China managed to
fully integrate into the global economy as core and
active participants in international value chains. Their
respective industrial policies facilitated their jump into
cutting edge IT in just a few decades. The 1980s saw
the East Asians enter the markets for PCs (personal
computers), VCRs (videocassette recorders), audio
cassette players and telecom equipment. In the 1990s
came memory chips and wireless cell phones, and
the 2000s brought various digital products, including
digital TVs, wireless telecommunication systems and
smart phones.
The development of all East Asian economies has
common elements. These include economic catch-up,
the fast technological progress of private firms and
industries, and government policies to reduce the risks
involved for firms in entering new industries.

happen when this is taken into account. More importantly, innovation does not have to be cutting-edge to
be socially valuable.

Technologies to address major
challenges, such as climate
change, are greatly needed
The future direction of innovation will depend on international and multilateral policies to address “grand
challenges,” such as access to education and health
and climate-change mitigation.
The successful public–private collaboration in quickly
identifying COVID-19 vaccine candidates shows how
mission-oriented policies can be useful in generating
important changes. Similar to the wartime efforts
during the 1940s, these collaborations relied on existing science and technologies, proving that they work
and ensuring the swift and large-scale production and
deployment of vaccines.
Can “mission-oriented” policies be used to address
the major and complex social, environmental and
economic challenges that face the world? Policies
based on centralized decision-making and the concentration of resources on one specific goal were very
useful in the case of NASA’s space program to reach
the Moon and of COVID-19 vaccine development. But
even mission-oriented policies may not be enough.
Some observers see government policies as just one
element of any solution, which will also require the
efforts of all stakeholders of the innovation ecosystem,
including consumers.

In other cases, market and non-market participants
may have insufficient local innovative capacity either
to identify, assimilate and learn from new technologies
developed elsewhere, or else generate the innovations
themselves. Low purchasing power may make it difficult
to access global innovation to serve their needs. Basic
infrastructure, such as roads, electricity or medical care,
and important institutions, such as an effective financial
sector, may be poor or non-existent, rendering some
foreign technologies less suitable. Innovation may then
need to be low-skilled, generally small in scale and
targeted at specific communities or regions.
In all cases, the needs of the country come first, as
innovation happens differently in different parts of
the world. Innovation imported from abroad has to be

using subsidies, regulations and standards to promote
environmental technologies, governments are helping
mitigate some of the risks and uncertainties associated
11

World Intellectual Property Report 2022

with investing in new, relatively untested alternative
energy technologies.
Innovation in low-carbon emission technologies, especially in the energy sector, has grown in the first two
decades of the 21st century and seen with a sharp
increase in related patenting. This is also the case of
enabling technologies, such as batteries, hydrogen
and smart grids.
However, technologies that are at the early stages of
development – basic or applied research stages – tend
to be riskier and so require public funding to mitigate
these risks. Carbon-removal technologies, for example,
are expensive to build and maintain.
In addition, perception of the risks associated with
global warming changes gradually. The incentive for
private stakeholders to invest in developing clean
technologies relies on such predicted demand.

Can policy help in shaping the
direction of innovation?
Public policy can shape the direction of innovation in
several ways:

Governments can also reduce risk or incentivize
adoption indirectly by inducing consumption of
goods and services containing a desired innovation. They can provide subsidies to producers to
keep prices down or to consumers to encourage
them to buy. They can influence adoption through
publicly-funded education programs to cut the
cost and increase the availability of skilled labor
and to promote entrepreneurship in selected fields.
Regulation of digital technologies – including how
access to data is governed – plays an important
role in sustaining a competitive marketplace that
promotes and rewards innovation. As digital technologies evolve at a fast pace, many governments
around the world are currently considering adapting
their regulatory toolbox.
The world’s grand challenges – addressing climate
change, reducing inequality, ensuring food security,
preventing pandemics – are public goods, and the
private sector on its own is unlikely to allocate enough
innovation resources to resolve them. Nor can climate
change be addressed by private and public-sector
efforts within individual economies. It is only through
a multi-stakeholder, internationally coordinated effort
that we will be able to solve these global challenges.

Scientific and technological discovery-stimulating
policies are most needed when innovation uncertainty and risk are greatest. For instance, governments use direct purchases regularly to assist the
development of defense and aerospace technologies.
Risk-mitigating policies are likely to be most effective in the early phases of development after an initial
discovery. R&D subsidies, soft loans and R&D tax
incentives are typical risk-mitigating policy instruments.
Early-adoption policies aim not only at reducing
innovation risk but also at increasing the number of
companies using a given technology. Governments
can step in to boost production of a given technology and by so doing ensure sufficient scale is
achieved for it to be profitable.

Introduction

What is the direction of innovation?

Since Scottish engineer James Watt (1736–1819) built the first workable steam engine over 250 years
ago, thereby effectively launching the First Industrial Revolution, rapid technological advances have
driven ever more widespread economic growth, benefitting countries and economic stakeholders
around the globe. Today, the world is at the outset of a new industrial revolution – the Fourth – based
on digital technologies, such as robotics, artificial intelligence and big data.
How much and how fast countries, industries and
companies invest in transforming research and development (R&D) resources, both human and financial,
into new technologies will in large part determine
future economic growth, standards of living and
overall global welfare.
However, not all decisions on innovation – understood
as commercialized new products and processes – are
simple to make. At any given moment, existing technologies compete with promising new ones in terms
of potential returns. The steam engine, electricity and
the Internet all had viable alternatives that could have
replaced them or blocked their development. In the
1800s, the “Stirling” heat engine was considered a
serious rival technology to the steam engine, but not
so well suited to the available raw materials and the
industrial needs of the time. At the turn of the 20th
century, urban lighting was mostly powered by gas.
Only once electricity became generally available in
the years that followed did cities start replacing gas
streetlights with safer, cheaper and brighter electric
lighting. In the 1980s, over a decade before email and
the Internet boom, an interactive online content service
known as Minitel was already being widely used in
France to communicate or buy goods via a screen,
keyboard and modem linked to the telephone network.
Ironically, such was the commitment to what was
then groundbreaking technology, but which ultimately
proved a dead end, that it slowed the Internet’s adoption in France compared to neighboring economies
which had developed no similar innovative system.
Deciding which technological path to follow is not, then,
a simple task. Whereas technological opportunities
may be in abundance at any point in time, the economic
resources to invest in innovation are not. The number
of talented people – engineers, scientists or entrepreneurs – and financial resources that can be assigned to

innovation activities is limited. To obtain the best returns
to R&D investments, private companies and entrepreneurs always weigh the technological prospects and
consumer preferences of one or other technology
before making innovation decisions. For instance,
petrol and electric-powered automobiles coexisted
at the start of the 20th century; however, little in the
way of electrical grid infrastructure existed outside
of urban areas, while the infrastructure to support
petrol-powered cars was less costly to develop. As a
result, consumers preferred the autonomy that petrol
cars provided.
The more successful an innovation decision is, the
more revolutionary – or “disruptive” – it may be: mobile
phones, for instance, have transformed the telephony
market. New companies and industries are created
to produce the successful innovations, replacing
producers of the less successful ones. Governments
and policymakers face the challenge of trying to pick
winners when deciding how best to use taxpayers’
money and designing policies to support innovation.
What economists call the “direction of innovation” – the
theme of this latest World Intellectual Property Report –
is the combination, or sum, of all the decisions individuals, firms, universities and governments make on which
technological opportunities to pursue. The short-term
economic implications of the direction of innovation are
relatively easy to anticipate and coordinate. To confront
the COVID-19 pandemic, governments and companies successfully redirected innovation investment
toward the discovery, approval and mass-production
of vaccines (see Chapter 3), achieving the objective
in record time. Vaccines dramatically cut the number
of deaths from the disease and helped the global
economy bounce back from the pandemic-provoked
slump of 2020, with the private companies involved in
vaccine production earning significant revenues.

What economists
call the “direction
of innovation” is
the combination,
or sum, of all
the decisions
individuals, firms,
universities and
governments
make on which
technological
opportunities
to pursue
In contrast, the long-term economic returns to the
direction of innovation are much less predictable and
harder to coordinate. It is difficult, for example, to
foresee what the effects of COVID-19 will be further
into the future. Similarly, current efforts to produce
“clean” technologies to curb CO2 emission, the most
common greenhouse gas, have so far yielded uncertain
results. It is unclear whether the resources devoted are
sufficient or whether the technological paths explored
are complementary enough to successfully address the
crisis of global warming (see Chapter 3). Technological
choices can open up unpredicted commercial opportunities, sometimes far into the future. As illustrated in
Chapter 2, solar panels were initially deployed as part
of the U.S. space program in the late 1950s, but it took
many years for their commercial use to take off.
Moreover, there is the question of not only how much to
invest, but also how to allocate this investment among
the different technological options. The allocation of
human and financial resources to given innovation
activities can set the direction of innovation of communities, countries and even the world for decades to come.
What is the role of government policy in setting the
direction of innovation? In many ways, national governments already attempt to direct innovation through
the funding of higher education and research-related
activities. Most economies have academic institutions, such as universities and other higher education

establishments, which run publicly-funded training
and research programs. These are part of long-term
policies attempting to address the uncertainties and
wide horizons of basic science. Governments also fund
mission-oriented science and technology programs,
such as the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) or the European Space Agency,
which frequently commission technological developments from the private sector.
Government policies and the innovation decisions
made by private companies coexist in a complex
innovation ecosystem that includes individuals – such
as scientists – government agencies and multinational
companies, among others. Government and private
companies can complement each other or otherwise
compete for the limited resources devoted to innovation. In either case, they are continuously influencing
one another. It was government demand, for instance,
that created the U.S. space program, NASA and the
U.S. aerospace industry (see Chapter 2). Understanding
innovation ecosystems is crucial for the design of
innovation policies that efficiently allocate resources
to induce and direct innovation toward the concrete
needs of the world.
Past scientific discoveries contribute to tomorrow’s
new innovative products. The basic research done
over the years, and the advances achieved in biology
and genetics made it possible to develop COVID-19
vaccines so quickly (see Chapter 3). Government and
private consumer choices inform engineers and entrepreneurs on what new products to develop.
Today there are several technologies on the verge of
producing great transformations: renewable energies,
gene editing and nanotechnologies, for example. A
new industrial revolution based on digital technologies
is already bringing profound changes to the global
economy, reshaping international and local value
(supply) chains and recasting the role of labor in
service industries. Some industries will shine, others
grow dim.
These new digital technologies can help meet the
world’s “grand challenges,” such as global warming
and future pandemics (see Chapter 3). But how can
policymakers ensure that the necessary innovation
continues to take place? How can they encourage
innovation in social welfare-enhancing fields such as
sustainable and socially responsible technologies?
This report attempts to provide a discussion on these
crucial topics. Chapter 1 explores the main conceptual elements governing the direction of innovation,
presenting the economic forces at work and setting
the direction of innovation in the context of innovation
ecosystems. Chapter 2 examines these concepts
in the light of three historical case studies: innovation during the Second World War, the formation of
15

a space industry and the rise of Asia’s information
and technology industry. Chapter 3 looks forward to
what innovation can do to meet three specific grand
challenges – creating clean technologies to contain
global warming; applying the lessons learned from the
COVID-19 crisis; and successfully riding the wave of
disruptive new digital technologies.

Chapter 1

Setting a course for the
direction of innovation

What is meant by the direction of innovation? It is the sum at any one time of the decisions made
by all individuals, firms, universities and governments – in whatever field of activity – about what
lines of innovation to pursue. Although the technological and scientific opportunities to innovate
may abound, the resources – both financial and human – to invest in innovation are limited. Some
decisions on where to pursue innovation end in spectacular success, as has recently been the case
with the new messenger Ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines developed to combat the Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus discussed below and in Chapter 3. Others
lead to a dead end.
Decisions on innovation taken by individuals and firms
are likely to be driven by the prospect of financial
profit. But they can also have a socioeconomic impact,
whether positive or negative, that is felt beyond the
immediate business context. Decisions may therefore
align or juxtapose social and private expectations for
the direction of innovation. Section 1.1 explores such
expectations by looking at the concepts of private and
social returns to innovation. The complex ecosystem of
companies, universities and government interactions
are the subject of Section 1.2. Section 1.3 explores the
economic forces that shape the direction of innovation.
Section 1.4 sets out the main policy instruments available to induce innovation and explores how they can
shape the direction of innovation. Section 1.5 discusses
how innovation can be brought about in less developed
countries. Section 1.6 concludes the chapter with some
general remarks on the future direction of innovation.

1.1

Social and private returns

Private companies and entrepreneurs constantly make
decisions about the innovation they hope will benefit
their business. They decide whether it is financially worthwhile incorporating new technologies into
production processes or developing new technologies
or products. They also decide what kind of technological opportunities to follow. For instance, companies
developing coronavirus disease (COVID) vaccines
opted between traditional vaccine technologies, where
a weakened or inactivated disease germ is used to
create a defense, or a new mRNA technology. (The
latter delivers a tiny piece of genetic code from the
SARS-CoV-2 virus in order to stimulate the production
of antibodies as an immune response.)

The private returns – essentially profits – on these
decisions are the difference between the income that
companies and entrepreneurs make from successfully
commercializing innovations set against all the costs –
including any failed earlier attempts – of development.
Governments can alleviate some of the costs through
tax policies, subsidies and loans. They can also assure
an income for private innovation by guaranteeing
prices. Such innovation policies are discussed further
in Section 1.4.
Social returns cover the impact of innovations on society
at large, including on the wider economy and the environment, and not just the effect on corporate bottom
lines. The concept incorporates all innovation benefits
or profits accruing to private companies, together with
scientific and technological innovations created in
universities and public research organizations. The latter
feed into private sector innovation, including through
university-launched start-ups and spin-off firms.
Innovations can have a transformative socioeconomic
effect – for the better or the worse – on, for example,
the environment, public health, local communities, or
on specific demographics. In many cases, such an
effect – an aspect of social returns – would not have
been taken into consideration by the private sector
when pursuing a given line of innovation. Economists
categorize such transformative innovations as “externalities,” because they are often unintended by the
stakeholders generating them.
For instance, when a firm develops a cheaper and more
productive new technology, all things being equal, it
should benefit from positive private returns in the form
of more profit, because it has gained a competitive
18

World Intellectual Property Report 2022

edge. But, if the technology should turn out to be
more environmentally friendly, it will also benefit the
wider community socioeconomically. The more rapidly
this cleaner technology diffuses to other companies
and markets, the higher the social returns will be.
Conversely, a private firm that develops a cheaper and
more productive – but more polluting – new technology
may also make higher profits, but the socioeconomic
impact will be negative.
Private stakeholders will seize innovation opportunities
most quickly when the expected returns are both foreseeable and easy to capture in monetary terms. They
are likely to be drawn to innovation projects where risk
of failure is lower, development times shorter and the
scale smaller (the smaller the size, the smaller the risk
tends to be). Innovation opportunities that depart from
these parameters are likely to be less straightforward
to monetize.1
That said, innovation opportunities that are riskier,
longer term and larger in scale frequently hold the greatest potential for positive social returns. For instance,
some breakthrough technologies – such as the steam
engine, electricity or the Internet – are later adopted widely, generating follow-on innovations across
many different industries. These are what is known as
“general purpose” technologies and further discussed
in Section 1.3. Such a diffusion often does not happen
immediately, and early investments can seem uncertain
and even quite hazardous for a time.
Many innovation opportunities arise when it comes to
addressing the biggest challenges confronting a society. Challenges such as global warming, pandemics or
crime generate pressure to provide clean technologies,
vaccines or better means of providing security. Innovation
can promote the sharing or diffusion of knowledge and
the accumulation of human capital. Governments may
want companies to share their innovation with other firms
for the greater good of the economy, including achieving
a better trained and skillful workforce, even if this limits
potential private returns to innovation.
Promoting both social and private returns to innovation
is a difficult mission for governments. They often choose
to do this by centralizing activities and resources on
innovations that affect the public good, that is, goods
or services made freely available to all, such as national
defense or knowledge. Governments, for instance, fund
public research and education in order to enhance the
provision of new scientific knowledge and disseminate it
more widely. They are also the main source of demand for
innovative technologies in given strategic industries like
defense or health.2 A clear and recent example involves
different government initiatives – for example, Operation
Warp Speed in the United States of America (U.S.) – facilitating and accelerating the development, manufacturing
and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics and
diagnostics (see Chapter 3, Box 3.1).

The social benefit of COVID-19 vaccines
far exceeds their private benefit

The direction of innovation is constantly changing due
to the choices made by, and the interactions between,
public and private stakeholders looking to optimize the
private and social returns to innovations in different
fields and industries. The next section looks at how
these stakeholders interact within a complex ecosystem when setting the direction of innovation.

Box 1.1
Social versus private benefits of COVID-19
vaccine development
The COVID-19 pandemic’s global scale and its far
reaching economic effects meant that the private
and social returns from a successful vaccine would
inevitably be high. Yet, how high exactly?
Based on data on the prices of successfully
commercialized vaccines and the assumption
that vaccination will eventually cover 75 percent of
the world’s population, Fink (2022) estimates total
private revenues to be USD 130.5 billion. Even if the
exact research and development (R&D) costs remain
uncertain, this figure represents a substantial private
return to innovation.
That said, the social benefit of vaccines is many
times higher. It consists of the value of lives saved
and health impairments avoided, as well as the value
of the economic output losses avoided by mitigating the need for measures, such as lockdowns,
taken by governments to contain the pandemic.
The study relies on a counterfactual epidemiological path informed by pre-vaccine infection cases
and the hypothetical attainment of herd immunity.
It then applies so-called value-of-a-statistical-life
(VSL) estimates and global output losses from the
19

World Intellectual Property Report 2022

pre-vaccine year 2020 to estimate a social benefit
of USD 70.5 trillion – exceeding the private benefit
by a factor of 887.
Successful COVID-19 vaccines would likely have
emerged without any public R&D funding. However,
the very high social return to successful vaccine
innovation underlines why governments mobilized
funding and helped coordinate clinical trials and the
scaling up of manufacturing capacity.
Fink’s study also explores how the emergence of
virus variants, the need for booster jabs and different epidemiological paths affect private and social
returns. These remain high relative to plausible
amounts of R&D investment, and the social benefit
is seen to always exceed the private benefit by a
factor of at least 220.
The calculation of the social return does not take
account of several socioeconomic effects that
are hard to quantify and, in part, may only materialize in the long-term. These include curtailed
access to health care as the pandemic overwhelmed
health care systems; educational losses due to the
prolonged closure of schools; workers losing their
jobs and permanently leaving the labor force; and
increases in public debt-to-GDP (gross domestic
product) ratios questioning fiscal sustainability and
crowding out other public investments.
In addition, early evidence suggests that the
pandemic is associated with a 5 percent reduction
in clinical trials for diseases other than COVID-19.3
A reallocation of R&D resources may well be in
a society’s best interest, given the threat posed
by the virus; nonetheless, it may come at the
expense of diminished progress in the fight against
other diseases.

1.2
Interactions within
innovation ecosystems
Scientific institutions can decide to influence the direction of innovation toward given fields by, for example,
developing more applied programs to train specialized
engineers or by transferring technology to specific
industries. Industries and companies can decide to
invest more intensively in R&D and other innovationgenerating activities. They do so either to create new
technologies or absorb existing ones from other innovation ecosystem stakeholders, such as universities,
suppliers or rival firms.4 Governments influence the
direction of innovation by allocating human and financial resources through a diverse range of public policy
instruments (see Section 1.4).

An innovation ecosystem can be defined as the combination of all the stakeholders that make choices influencing innovation-related outcomes and, consequently,
the direction of innovation. Stakeholders include firms,
ranging from specialized suppliers to end-consumer
manufacturers or retailers, and, as noted, institutions
with a scientific and technological mission, such as
universities or public research organizations. But
ecosystems also can involve institutions without a
primary scientific or technological mission, such as
government agencies, financial institutions or intellectual property (IP) offices, to name a few. The degree
of articulation of an innovation environment is defined
not only by the degree to which its institutions are
developed, but also by their interactions. The choices
and interactions that occur within the ecosystem will
heavily influence the direction of innovation.

Ecosystems assemble
geographically and thematically
Several strands of the economic and social sciences
literature have addressed the notion of innovation
ecosystems.5 Ecosystem stakeholders engage in nonlinear and strongly interdependent flows of knowledge
and ideas that ultimately result in innovation.
Innovation and knowledge are found to flow most
easily within certain geographical or thematic boundaries.6 Individuals and institutions in the same city
or region will multiply their interactions – formal or
informal – generating more opportunities for knowledge to flow and innovation to ignite. The same rule
applies to an innovation ecosystem sharing common
technologies or commercial links, such as in a specific
global value chain. Individuals and institutions sharing
a similar scientific, technological or industrial background will also most easily communicate and, hence,
exchange knowledge.7 The area around San Francisco
known as Silicon Valley, with its vibrant information
and communications technology (ICT) innovation
ecosystem, is an example of both geographical and
thematic concentration. On the other hand, the global
value chains of carmakers are examples of thematic
but not geographical concentration; that is, highly
specific innovation flows in all directions between
auto parts suppliers and automobile assemblers in
various parts of the world.
Note that geographical and thematic proximity is predicated on the mobility of skilled individuals, who are the
best conduits of knowledge flows, especially those
with implicit knowledge. Talented individuals hop in and
out of jobs within the same ecosystem, transmitting
information and knowledge as they go. However, the
absence of geographical or thematic proximity does
not necessarily preclude innovation ecosystems from
linking with outside stakeholders or other scientific and
technological themes.8

How an ecosystem sets a direction
The interaction between innovation ecosystem stakeholders is based on knowledge flows. These knowledge
flows accumulate within an innovation ecosystem and
determine the potential innovation opportunities available to stakeholders, which in turn sets the direction of
innovation. Figure 1.2 summarizes these interactions,
which are further discussed as follows.
In innovation ecosystems, every stakeholder contributes to and makes use of a knowledge set.9 Professors
train future scientists, technologists and entrepreneurs
using this knowledge in university or technical educational programs, while researchers contribute new basic
and applied scientific knowledge to the set. Engineers
and technologists apply this knowledge when working
in a company, university or government agency, and
their use of it contributes to an increase in the experimental and technical base. Entrepreneurs make use
of this knowledge when creating new companies and
add to it when devising a new product or process.
What sets the direction of innovation chosen by stakeholders? There are several interactions happening at the
same time. To begin with, there is curiosity. Curiosity
leads researchers into exploring a new scientific field

and engineers into experimenting with a novel technique or new technology. Curiosity is not confined to
university and public institution research programs.
More and more companies have engineering or formal
R&D units, where scientific and technological curiosity
abounds. Individuals outside of a university or company
lab can get curious too. Thomas Edison (b. 1847–d.
1931), the self-taught inventor of the electric light bulb,
among other things; actress and inventor Hedy Lamarr
(b. 1914–d. 2000) and Steve Jobs (b. 1955–d. 2011),
co-founder of Apple Inc, all had their curiosity sparked
outside of any kind of formal organizational framework.10
Companies, entrepreneurs and governments identify
innovation opportunities based on predictions as to
potential private and social returns – that is, the potential profit to a company or society.
A company that has an innovative new product in
mind will assess what kind of skilled labor and technological capital is required to develop and produce
it. The necessary labor and equipment may already
be available in the market or the company may need
to train workers or create the equipment from scratch.
Because of the risks and costs involved, it is likely
that innovations will come about faster in areas where
there is talent and equipment already available. For
21

World Intellectual Property Report 2022

instance, the more proficient computer scientists
and engineers and advanced computing hardware
there are in an innovation ecosystem, the more likely
it is that entrepreneurs and companies will pursue
ICT-related innovation.

can stimulate specialized suppliers of machinery and
equipment to develop innovation in the fields of robotics
and automation for other industries. Similarly, the cost
of transport can trigger innovation in containerization
or three-dimensional (3D) printing technologies.

Conversely, a lack of capital or labor can also serve
to motivate innovation opportunities. A shortage of
advanced computing-related hardware can itself create
innovation opportunities for specialized suppliers in
the ICT industry like those offering shared computing
and storage capacity services. The cost of specialized
labor too can motivate equipment entrepreneurs to
produce a labor-replacing innovation. Several scholars
indicate that labor scarcity in the United States during
the 19th century served to redirect innovation efforts
toward labor-saving technologies faster than in Britain,
which had until then been the world’s industrial leader.11
Scarcity of skilled labor can also motivate universities
and government agencies into creating new training
programs to provide the type of specific skilled workforce needed by specific industries.

Governments’ participation in innovation incorporates funding public research and education as well
as being the main source of demand for innovation
technologies in strategic industries. Government
policies frequently induce and support changes in
academic programs to increase the supply of skilled
labor. This was the case for government research
institutes created in the Republic of Korea in the
1960s and 1970s; for example, the Korea Institute
of Science and Technology (see Chapter 2). There
are also examples from China dating from the 1990s
onward. In both cases, institutions fostered the training of a specialized workforce for the IT industry.
Areas where governments serve as the main source of
demand for innovation technologies include defense,
health, education and agriculture.14

Innovation is responsive to profit-making opportunities, which are in turn linked to the size of an actual or
potential market.12 The prospects of higher demand
will induce entrepreneurs and companies to invest, as
they will be more certain of recovering their innovation
costs and making a profit. Economies of scale also
apply to the process of innovating. The more people
there are with a problem, the more likely it is that an
innovative solution will be found. By the same token,
the more people there are thinking about a problem,
the easier it will be to find the inventive talent needed
to solve it. The same logic applies to specific inputs
and tools.
Market size and preferences go a long way toward
explaining the rate at which firms innovate in any
given direction, as evidenced by today’s computer
and mobile phone markets. The boom in automobile
consumption (and the intertwined innovation) during
the early part of the 20th century had more to do with
economic and social changes in certain regions of the
world than it did with technological opportunities. The
scientific knowledge and the technology of combustion engines and other automobile parts pre-dated
the supply and demand boom. Indeed, some scholars
argue that automobile innovation only took off with the
emergence of a relatively affluent middle class in the
United States able to afford the price of cars.13
The market does not only include private end-consumers; it also includes other companies in a supply chain,
as well as governments and institutions. A scarcity
and cost of skilled labor or technological capital can,
as mentioned, generate potential markets for companies supplying new equipment or offering specialized
training. These “business-to-business” markets also
help set the direction of innovation. The cost of labor

1.3

The economic forces at work

Decisions made by an innovation ecosystem’s stakeholders constantly change the direction of innovation.
This section explores how they “deepen” or “widen” it.

“Deepening” the direction of innovation
Economic resources gravitate to the most profitable
technologies and the industries that use them. This
has the effect of reinforcing past technological decisions and prioritizing the most successful innovations
and industries. This reinforcing mechanism “deepens”
current innovation decisions in scientific fields and
industries, playing a strong role in setting the direction
of innovation.
The simple allocation of more talented people and
greater financial resources to a given field or industry is
how companies or governments can directly influence
the direction of innovation. Reallocation of more scientists and R&D equipment speeds the pace of scientific
discovery and innovation in a given technology field.
This was the case, for instance, in efforts to discover
new antibiotics during the first half of the 20th century
or, more recently, to produce COVID-19 vaccines (see
Chapters 2 and 3).15 Allocating more innovation inputs
is also likely to generate more innovations relating to
production processes. R&D units in companies can
either develop new ideas or adapt existing ones in
order to increase the production efficiency of existing
products. Economic studies are consistently finding
that those private companies and industries investing
the most in R&D end up producing the most for every
unit of capital or labor invested.16
22

Scientific output has shifted toward “hard” sciences
Figure 1.3 Shares of scientific publications by scientific field, 1840–2019

Source: Microsoft Academic Graph.
Note: Based on the scientific fields identified by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

The direction of innovation is inherently related to the
allocation of resources. Fields and industries regularly
investing the most in R&D will eventually outpace in
terms of scientific, technological and innovative output
those investing the least. For instance, a century ago,
scientific interest in virology and investments in virus
vaccine production were much lower than today, even
in relative terms (i.e., taking into account the different
level of knowledge that existed). It was not just the
discoveries in the field that came later, but also the
rapid reallocation of resources to them and to related
industries that explain the subsequent direction of innovation and the increased activity. The multinational and
complex value chains of the automobile and airplane
industries of today have their origins in the almost
amateurish innovations developed in independent and
informal workshops over a century ago. (The Wright
Brothers, credited with flying the first motor-operated
airplane, began their careers working in a bicycle
repair shop.) Mobile phones and Internet-connected
applications – which did not even exist until relatively
recently – have now become the standard for work
and leisure. These are all examples of scientific and
technological opportunities where governments and
companies went from allocating nothing to pouring
in abundant human and financial resources over the
course of just a few decades.
The historical data on scientific publications also point
to a rapid shift in the allocation of innovation resources
(see Figure 1.3). The shares of scientific publications by
scientific fields can be seen to reflect the preferences
of scientific stakeholders across these fields, indicating the effective direction of science and, eventually,
innovation.17 The proportion of publications across the
main scientific fields changed considerably between
the early 19th century and the second half of the 20th

century. During this period, research relating to health
sciences, engineering and natural sciences – often
called the “hard” sciences – increased its overall share.
From the early 1800s to the 2010s, the share of natural
sciences publications, in fields such as mathematics, physics, chemistry or biology, increased from 16
percent to 36 percent of total recorded scientific publications. In the same period, the share of engineeringrelated publications went from 7 percent to 24 percent,
while the share of health and medical sciences went
from 9 percent to 16 percent.
Similarly, patent applications by technological field
can be seen to reflect the direction of innovation taken
by stakeholders. A rapid change in the direction of
innovation is very noticeable in the distribution across
technological fields of total first filing patent applications worldwide (see Figure 1.4). Unsurprisingly, during
the last century, those technological fields relating
to ICTs saw the biggest growth in share. Within ICT,
computer technologies grew the most, accounting for
over 10 percent of all patents in the decade to 2020.
A similar pattern can be seen in digital communication, telecommunications and semiconductors. The
larger concentration of patents in ICTs was mostly at
the expense of “traditional” technologies, particularly
those relating to mechanical engineering, for example,
machines, tools and combustion engines.
The dynamics of success reinforce the pattern of
deepening. Scientists and technologists will rationally
choose careers in the most productive scientific fields
and industries. Entrepreneurs and large corporations
will prioritize projects, such as creating new companies
or new products, in promising industries. Over time,
innovation resources – both human and financial – will
naturally gravitate toward the most productive fields

and industries. This mechanism reinforces and deepens the innovation trajectories of successful scientific
fields and industries.

“Widening” the direction of innovation
Industries, companies and scientific and technological institutions within an innovation ecosystem interact regularly. Their innovation activities benefit from
the innovation and economic activities happening
around them. Theoretical scientific fields benefit from
the systematic and continuous use of technologies
by applied scientists and engineers. New scientific
discoveries in one field are often simply the synthesis
of knowledge from different fields. Scientific discoveries in physics impact ICT industries while computing
power and storage-related innovations from private
companies contribute to the scientific productivity
of researchers and physics institutions. Biological
research labs increasingly use customized 3D printers
to produce lab tools and equipment specifically for their
research. At the same time, 3D printing technologists
have been exploring “bioprinting” applications, such
as the construction of organs for implantation, based
on insights from biological science.18
The lines dividing science and technology have become
increasingly blurred – a trend that began as far back
as the mid-1800s. Today’s industries both inspire and
benefit from the information, techniques and methods
originating in science laboratories.19 This is especially
the case in current high-tech industries, where basic
science research is most influential.20 The R&D labs of
companies like Apple, Google, Huawei, Samsung or
Tencent produce basic scientific outputs that contribute
directly to the innovations they make.

Sometimes allocating more resources to innovation in
one field translates into more output in another field.
History is full of cases where an innovation in one
industry spreads to others. Originally developed to
pump water out of flooded mines, the steam engine
became the main source of power for railroad and
maritime transport is one example. Some chemical
companies involved in the development of synthetic
rubber, triggered by vehicle-maker demand for rubber
tires, ended up switching industries to become intrinsic parts of the automotive industry and ceased to be
chemical concerns altogether.
Industries relying on audiovisual, biological or management technologies have benefitted from the ICT revolution. Audiovisual industries for a long time advanced in
step with innovations in lenses or analogic recording
techniques. But the past three decades have witnessed
an overhaul of the entire industry by digital technologies
for recording and sharing content. The same applies
to the increased use of digital technologies – both
hardware and software – in the labs of pharmaceutical industries and the management departments of all
industries. Fields such as audio-visual technologies,
IT methods for management and, to a lesser extent,
analysis of biological materials have increased their
shares of patent applications. The underlying patent
data indicate that this can be traced back to the adoption of ICT technologies, as shown in Figure 1.5.
Much of the direction of innovation is set by the knowledge gained by industries through operating experience
or supply chains.21 This is particularly pronounced in
the case of the machine-tool and equipment industries
developing new capital goods for other industries.22
Incorporating innovative tools and equipment is the most
24

World Intellectual Property Report 2022

straightforward route for other industries to become
more innovative and productive. For instance, continuous innovations in lathe and milling tools have had a
big impact on the productivity of most manufacturing
industries. Likewise, innovation in pasteurization techniques and refrigeration equipment have been crucial
to the food industry.
Knowledge and innovation flows across fields and
industries provide scientists, engineers and entrepreneurs with a strong incentive to move to new fields
and industries applying the technologies they have
mastered. Contrary to “deepening”, when “widening” is at work, R&D and innovation resources may
be efficiently relocated to areas where there is less
competition and more opportunities. This widening
mechanism diffuses a given technology to other fields
and industries, redistributing the allocation of financial

and human resources and ultimately affecting the
direction of innovation.

Differing maturity, differing returns
If successful, an innovation – a new product or new
process – progresses through consecutive improvements to the underlying technology that accumulate
over time. Different stakeholders nurture this accumulation of improvements. During the gestation of
an innovation, only a few entrepreneurs and even
fewer companies participate in the development and
improvement of the technology. Slowly, the accumulation of improvements accelerates in phases, with the
sequential appearance of inventors, innovators and
imitators moving into the field or industry concerned
(see Figure 1.5).

The entry of new entrepreneurs and innovative firms
brings fresh technological know-how and ideas to
established firms. This new entry produces a widening
of the technological and industrial scope of those firms
using the innovation. There are ever and more diverse
companies thinking how to better improve the technology for a specific case. Over time, these new firms
often replace many of the established ones. This is
what is known as a “creative destruction,” whereby the
most innovative – as in more creative and commercially
successful – companies take the place of old ones.23

The new and surviving firms set the direction of innovation in the sector concerned during this and following
phases. In the later phases, there is a deepening of
a by then well-established technological trajectory,
mostly through incremental innovation and imitation.
The innovation ecosystem reacts differently during
different phases. The maturity of a given technology is
likely to affect just how incremental innovation is, and,
consequently, who dictates its direction: thus, smaller
and younger firms dictate the direction of innovation

25

World Intellectual Property Report 2022

in the early widening phase, whereas established
and market-dominant firms do so during the deepening phase.24
Why does this happen? There are considerable differences between private and social returns during the
successive waves of technological improvement. The
prospects of private returns are not only very different
at each stage within a given industry or field, they are
also different across industries that are at a different
phase of technological maturity.
During the gestation of a new technology, private
returns to innovation are typically low, due to a higher
failure risk in comparison to existing competing technologies. Yet, the social returns to fully developing a
gestating technology are potentially high.25 Regardless
of all the private and social costs of first-moving firms
not surviving – for example, bankruptcies, jobs lost,
and so on – society as a whole might still benefit
in the long term from the maturing and resulting
consolidation of a new technology and the establishment of more efficient firms. In the U.S., hundreds
of small private carmakers produced an equivalent
variety of automobile models in the first decade of
the 20th century. Only a few decades later consumers could purchase fewer but more reliable models
produced largely by a handful of companies. These
mature versions of automobiles became standard
transport equipment in many industries, benefiting society beyond just producers and consumers
of automobiles.
Nobody knows exactly when, or if, a technology will
spark. Sometimes, there may be an initial promise of
private returns, but realizing this promise turns out to be
more difficult or take longer to achieve than had been
anticipated. For instance, solar panel technology was
employed in the space industry way before it become
a commercially viable option for household energy
generation (see Chapter 3).26
As the prospects of private returns grow, more companies are likely to enter the specific market, thereby
increasing the influence private companies have over
the direction of innovation. In later phases, private
returns are often high enough to provide a sufficient
incentive for more companies to adopt now mature
technologies and enter markets.

Systemic shocks and
general-purpose technologies
Sometimes, there are large and unexpected “systemic” shocks – such as those brought about by new
breakthrough technologies, epidemiological crises or
wars – that shake the preferences and priorities of the
innovation ecosystem’s stakeholders. These shocks
can generate widespread changes affecting multiple

stakeholders and alter how private and social returns
to innovation are perceived.
Very occasionally, a new breakthrough technology
appears that is widely adopted across a wide range
of sectors, while being at the same time in continuous technical development within its originating field
or industry. It becomes what the economic literature
terms a general-purpose technology, able to deepen
and widen its trajectory at one and the same time. It
enables follow-on innovations elsewhere, while still
pushing at the technological frontiers within its sector
(see Figure 1.6). New companies and entrepreneurs
adopt sequentially this general-purpose technology,
triggering long-lasting waves of cumulative technological improvement.27
Different moments of history tend to be characterized by the development and diffusion of specific
collections of broadly complementary technologies.
These share the characteristic of permeating a wide
range of industries and being used in the training of
professionals in new fields of engineering and other
applied sciences. The already noted historical examples of breakthrough innovations such as steam power,
electricity, the internal combustion engine and, more
recently, ICT technologies all generated ripple effects
across scientific and technological fields, as well as in
industries and markets.
These general-purpose technologies reconfigure the
main collections of technologies in a way no other
technologies do.28 Their widespread use generates
competition for financial and human resources between
the sector producing them and those sectors applying them. Such is the case, for example, in ICT technologies being employed in other fields like biotech.
Technologies relating to IT methods for management
and to the analysis of biological materials are sectors
that apply ICT and which kept growing alongside the
expanding patent share of the ICT-generating digital
communication and computer technology sectors. The
high demand for IT-skilled labor (i.e., people) and for
semi-conductor inputs (e.g., ingots, wafers, integrated
circuits, etc.) are two examples of the competitive
tension that can arise between sectors; tension that
can be resolved with new education programs and
investments in new production capacity.
Systemic shocks transform the main technological
base of an existing innovation ecosystem. While most
such events can be traced back to a “eureka” moment
– for example the discovery of penicillin, the transistor or the CRISPR-Cas9 system for gene editing29 – it
takes years of knowledge diffusion and cumulative
incremental improvements until the breakthroughs
come to full fruition.
Systemic shocks do not need to be scientific or technological in nature.30 Large national investments in

R&D can shift under particular conditions, such as the
COVID-19 pandemic or the Second World War. This
indicates that the direction of technological activity
can be very responsive to both economic needs and
non-economic imperatives.

military use. But it also fostered the development of
communication and medical technologies, which had
immediate applications in non-military markets (see
Chapter 2).31

There are shocks that arise out of natural disasters,
such as earthquakes, tsunamis, wildfires, floods or
pandemics. These natural disasters can alter preferences within a society as to the importance of any
particular environmental or agricultural technology.
There are shocks to a country’s national interest, such
as armed conflict, geopolitical upheavals or trade wars.
These national interest shocks can affect how societies prioritize innovation in defense, including space
exploration, for instance. Other social phenomena –
such as cultural and religious beliefs – can also change
the focus of innovation, affecting for example what is
considered morally acceptable in medical innovation.
Economic events – such as financial crises or inflation – can also shift innovation priorities by prioritizing
cost-cutting technologies or innovation relating to
social assistance.

1.4
How can policy shape
the direction of innovation?

Governments and policymakers are usually called
upon to act after such priority-changing shocks.
Governments have a long history of redirecting research
into specific areas such as health, agriculture and, most
certainly, defense. Wars are among the most explicit
examples of a systemic shock shifting innovation preferences across an ecosystem. The U.S. Government
responded to the Second World War by mobilizing
the innovation ecosystem to develop technologies for

Economic resources are finite and not allocated to
every scientific field or industry in equal amount. The
allocation of funds and talent governs how ecosystems shape the direction of innovation.32 Who decides
which technological opportunities are given priority in
resource allocation ultimately determines the direction
of innovation. Innovation policies are designed to shape
these priorities.
This section explores first the broad categories of
policy instruments available to induce innovation. It then
turns to a discussion about innovation policy neutrality,
before looking at the role played by policy tools aimed
at stimulating demand for certain technologies.

Innovation policy tools
There is a whole set of policy instruments available
to policymakers who want to determine the direction
of innovation. This subsection reviews these in broad
terms and relates them to the overall innovation cycle
– from gestation to maturity – shown in Figure 1.5.
The instruments in question are innovation policies
27

Who decides which
technological
opportunities
are given priority
in resource
allocation ultimately
determines
the direction
of innovation.
Innovation
policies are
designed to shape
these priorities
designed to induce discovery, mitigate risk and encourage early adoption and diffusion.

Discovery-inducing policies
Scientific and technological discovery-stimulating policies are most needed when innovation uncertainty and
risk are at their greatest. The most typical example of
such a policy is publicly-funded research carried out
in academic institutions and public research organizations. Through such a policy instrument, governments
can exert a great deal of influence over the potential
direction of innovation, prioritizing one field over another. But governments may need to fund programs for
years in order for a commercially promising discovery
to arise. Before resources are allocated there needs to
be a dialogue between policymakers and the scientific
community about what direction to take.
A more direct approach is through government
purchases. For instance, governments use regular
direct purchases to stimulate the development of
defense and aerospace technologies. Contracts can
be awarded in different ways, so as to allow either
competition or collaboration among the different
innovation stakeholders. An example of the latter is
when specialized companies and universities come
together to create consortia to deliver the innovative

good demanded. Yet, this instrument requires a
government to have an in-depth technical knowledge
of the specific deliverable and be able to handle not
only technically complex contracts but also followup compliance.
Academic prizes – such as the Nobel Prizes in different scientific fields – or patents can also act indirectly
as discovery-stimulating instruments. However, as
prizes and patents are only awarded after a discovery
or invention has been made, they have little influence
on the direction of discovery.
The policy instruments discussed below can also spur
discovery, although typically their impact is felt most
strongly in the later phases of an innovation cycle.

Risk-mitigating and early-adoption policies
Arguably, risk-mitigating policies can be used all
through the innovation cycle. But they are likely to be
most effective in the early phases of development after
the initial discovery. R&D subsidies, soft loans – loans
with no or below-market interest rates – and R&D
tax incentives are three typical risk-mitigating policy
instruments. One example is the subsidies for R&D
granted to companies developing COVID-19 vaccines
(see Chapter 3).
Early-adoption policies aim not only at reducing
innovation risk, but also at increasing the number
of companies using a given technology. Even when
a technology is promising enough to use – that is, it
has a low adoption risk – its current cost may prevent
adoption. In the early stages, new technologies are
typically produced on a small scale and inefficiently,
which increases costs and constrains any potential
profit for adopters. Governments can step in to boost
the production of a given technology and by so doing
ensure sufficient scale is achieved for it to become
profitable. For instance, during the Second World War,
the U.S. Government provided the subsidies and soft
loans necessary to scale up the penicillin-producing
capacity of pharmaceutical companies hesitant to
invest in what was then an innovative antibiotic medicine (see Chapter 2). Subsidies, soft loans and tax
incentives are also examples of adoption policies that
can be applied on the supply side to provide a direct
stimulus for companies to adopt a new technology for
use in R&D activities or as equipment.
On the other hand, governments can choose to reduce
risk or incentivize adoption indirectly, by inducing the
consumption of those goods and services that incorporate a desired innovation. Such indirect adoption policies
include government subsidies to producers to keep retail
prices down and subsidies to consumers encouraging
them to buy. An example of the former is the aid given
to solar panel producers by the German Government,
28

World Intellectual Property Report 2022

while for the latter, many governments have subsidized
the purchase of electric vehicles in order to make it more
attractive to consumers (see Chapter 3).
Governments can also influence adoption take-up
through publicly-funded educational programs in
universities and technical training institutions. These
programs influence the cost and availability of skilled
labor and promote entrepreneurship in selected fields.
IT schools in California provided the Silicon Valley
industries with skilled – and cheaper – computer
scientists and engineers. These schools also spurred a
generation of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs into founding
many of the IT giants of today.
Furthermore, IP instruments can also be part of an
adoption-policy strategy. Patents allow the decoupling
of the discovery of an innovation from its adoption.
Inventors do not need to create a company to apply
the technology – they can leave that to others. This
provides a mechanism for innovation specialization,
whereby inventors can keep doing what they are
good at and sell their inventions to more experienced
commercial entrepreneurs.
Governments have different policy instruments with
which to stimulate discovery and, complementarily,
induce adoption by providing licensing schemes to
different potential users. For instance, public research
organizations – under government contracts – can
apply different licensing schemes to specific industries
or companies in order to reduce the cost of adoption
for the ones targeted. The U.S. space agency NASA
offers different licensing terms to different contractors, including a different range of licensing fees;
for example, it often grants free licenses to start-up
companies spawned from NASA projects.
Trademarks and industrial designs can also act as an
adoption incentive, by giving early adopters the chance
to monetize their advantage.33 This has been the case of
the smartphone industry, where companies like Apple
or Samsung rely on the strength of their designs and
brand recognition, together with product innovation,
to secure their market position.

Can innovation policies be market neutral?
Much of the innovation policy discussion has drawn on
the economic insight that the production of knowledge
has the characteristics of a public good, in that it is easy
and cheap to copy.34 But this means private companies
and individuals may have difficulty in reaping returns
to innovations, because others can benefit from the
knowledge acquired without having paid toward the
cost of generating that knowledge.
Thus, innovating companies are likely to benefit the
overall innovation ecosystem thanks to the knowledge
they create spreading to other companies, including
suppliers and competitors. But they will face greater
competition from, and even risk being overtaken by,
rivals that did not bear the cost of developing a new
and successful technology. Economists often consider
such a situation as removing the economic incentive to invest in innovation, thereby creating what is
termed a “market failure” requiring policy intervention
as a corrective.
The argument that innovation-related “market failures”
need to be corrected has dominated much of innovation
policy research and discussion. However, very little has
been proposed by way of economic policy discussions
as to where innovation investments should go. Other
economists affirm the contrary, arguing that the direction of innovation is not the concern of public policies;
for them, public policies should be market neutral.35
A market-neutral innovation policy seeks to stimulate
the production of new knowledge and technologies
without distorting the current market structure – that
is, without altering the market status quo or favoring
one participant over another.36 For instance, many
innovation policies attempt neutrality by supporting
scientific and technological research in universities
and public research organizations, while declining to
do the same for private companies. Decisions on which
technological opportunity to pursue are instead to be
left to individual firms to make. In practice, however,
it is very difficult for government policy to be entirely
market neutral. Policy-induced changes to the direction
of scientific and technological research may eventually
lead to a change in the direction of innovation.

Diffusion policies
A technology is successfully diffused when adopted
by most companies as the industry standard. In the
case of a general-purpose technology, several other
industries start adopting it as well. Governments can
influence diffusion through workforce training, subsidies, loans, tax credits and direct purchases. Typically,
the diffusion of technologies that have proven successful in the originating industry should encounter less
risk and lower adoption costs. For that reason, it is
to be expected that private stakeholders will be more
financially involved.

Moreover, there is a tacit bias in “neutral” innovation
policies. Left to themselves, private companies are
quite likely to select innovation projects that have safer
and faster financial returns. As discussed earlier, the
market is unlikely to select new, potentially disruptive
technologies, which are more uncertain and riskier,
ahead of well-established, mature technologies. Neutral
innovation policies that let the market decide the direction of innovation are likely to reduce diversity and
horizon of investments to an undesirable degree from
society’s point of view. This same bias favors follow-on
innovation along already profitable technological paths
29

World Intellectual Property Report 2022

and discourages follow-on innovation along new ones,
thereby reinforcing the conservative dynamic.37
To conclude, innovation policy neutrality seems to
be at odds with general practice. Several of the most
industrialized economies – the United States, Western
European countries, Japan and China, to name a few
– have historically directed a large portion of public
investment in R&D into either creating or stimulating
specific technologies and their complementary markets
in fields such as national defense, public health or agriculture.38 Likewise, policymakers have in recent years
been more inclined to provide direct financial support
to those R&D-intensive sectors critical for national
security, such as semiconductors.39
As a result, more and more, scholars agree that innovation policies have to be market-making or market-shaping, rather than just seeking to fix failures.40 However,
unreliable information – inaccurate, incomplete or
mistaken data, for example – and the high degree of
uncertainty surrounding innovation inevitably set limits
on the extent to which governments can successfully tilt
the direction of innovation in a socially desirable way.

Demand-side, mission-oriented policies
Demand-side innovation policies are often broadly
referred to as “mission-oriented” policies. Their main
features are centralized decision-making and the
concentration of resources on one specific goal. In
other words, the direction of innovation is set by the
government, which acts as the main source of demand
for a targeted innovation.41
Archetypical examples of mission-oriented programs
are the medical research conducted by the U.S. Office
of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), set
up to mobilize civilian science during the Second
World War, and NASA’s space program to land on the
Moon. These case studies – discussed in further detail
in Chapter 2 – show how directed, mission-oriented
initiatives by governments can facilitate and direct innovation toward specific technological solutions. These
initiatives had clear achievable targets, were national in
scope and entailed a subset of industries. For instance,
in the development of the technologies needed for
the space industry, the role of the government was to
overcome the extremely high cost of developing the
technologies needed for space exploration. These
costs were due to the large scale and longer period
required to develop unprecedented technologies with
a narrow and extremely specialized application.42
Some economics scholars suggest that demand-side
policy instruments could also be used to address the
major and complex social, environmental and economic challenges confronting the world, sometimes referred
to as the “grand challenges.”43 These are categorized

as major and complex, because they are extremely
intertwined and widespread, but more importantly they
require urgent and coordinated action.44 For example,
global environmental concerns cannot be solved without international, inter-industry and multidisciplinary
coordination. National governments need to agree on
global solutions, companies have to set standards and
best practices along their entire global value chains,
and scientific and technological experts from different
fields – energy, biodiversity or meteorology, to name
a few – need to collaborate to produce new solutions
(see Chapter 3).
To some degree, addressing the grand challenges
requires more than just government-directed policies.45 Several innovation economists argue that
mission-oriented policies will not be sufficient.46 What
is needed are broad, well-funded initiatives that deploy
government policies as one element of the solution,
while acknowledging the need for concerted efforts
from the different stakeholders within the innovation
ecosystem.47 This inevitably requires the participation of private companies, universities and research
institutes, civil societies, individuals and international
communities in order to effect the change globally.
Getting all these elements to work together requires a
mechanism (or several) to help coordinate the priorities
and resource allocation of individual initiatives.
Unfortunately, there is not yet a complete example of a
grand challenge having been successfully addressed
by innovation policies alone. Nonetheless, steps undertaken through international cooperation and agreements highlight the necessity for concerted efforts
worldwide to address these challenges. For example,
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC) or the International Civil Aviation
Organization’s (ICAO) sustainable aviation fuel initiatives show the international commitment to meeting
the goals of reducing carbon emission and addressing
climate change.

1.5
Developing economies
and the direction of innovation
There are arguably two main routes for innovation in
low- and middle-income developing economies, as with
any economy: adapting foreign technologies or creating technologies locally. Yet developing economies,
particularly the poorer states, are unlike developed
ones. The problems needing to be resolved by innovation are substantially different. Developing economies’
ability to absorb or generate technological solutions
with which to address their specific socio-economic
needs depends on their local innovation ecosystem and
how connected it is to global innovation networks.48
In some cases, market and non-market participants
may have in sufficient local innovative capacity either

ecosystem and
how connected
it is to global
innovation networks
to identify, assimilate and learn from new technologies
developed elsewhere or else generate the innovations
themselves. Low purchasing power may make it difficult
to access global innovation to serve their needs. Basic
infrastructure, such as roads, electricity or medical care,
and important institutions, such as an effective financial
sector, may be poor or non-existent, rendering some
foreign technologies less suitable. Innovation may then
need to be low-skilled, generally small in scale and
targeted at specific communities or regions.
In other cases, innovation ecosystem stakeholders
may have access to varying levels of innovative capacity. Such economies – usually those in the middleincome bracket – are able to leverage their scientific
capacity, technological capital and skilled labor to
narrow the technological gap between them and the
most advanced economies. This was the case of the
IT industry in the many East Asian economies – as
further discussed in Chapter 2 – that managed to fully
integrate into the global economy as core and active
participants in international value chains.49 A handful
– including China and India – have become sources of
innovation in several technological fields and participate
actively in global innovation networks by contributing

scientific knowledge, technologies and technologicallyadvanced goods and equipment.50

Adapting foreign technologies
Adapting foreign technologies to the needs of developing-economy markets tends to be incremental, with
limited improvements added to the original technology.
But not all foreign technologies can be easily transposed to developing economies.
Not all innovation from elsewhere is relevant to the
needs of developing economies. Innovations from highly
innovative economies – predominantly Western Europe,
Northern America and East Asia – are conceived for
economies with industries that are typically more
capital-intensive due to relatively higher wages; have
the skilled labor to implement and operate the innovations; have mass-production processes using highquality infrastructure; and, have consumers with higher
purchasing power.51 By contrast, as has already been
noted, developing economies tend to have relatively
abundant but less skilled labor; are segmented with
diverse needs; have weak or absent infrastructure; and
have consumers with relatively low purchasing power.
These differences often make frontier technologies
less appropriate for the needs of poorer economies.52
The adoption of automation in South Africa’s apparel
industry provides an example. South African apparel firms have been shifting toward capital-intensive
production, but uptake of automation technologies
has been limited. Lack of access to capital, the inconsistency of order volume, lack of government support,
low margins and the low profitability of the industry in
general are some of the factors that explain the lack
of automation.53
Even if appropriate for local needs, frontier innovation is often costly. Adapting frontier technologies to
make them affordable requires high levels of technical
knowledge. Since price is one of the main constraints,
most innovation efforts are geared toward reducing
costs, either through using cheaper inputs, such as
local raw materials to substitute for the original ones,
or stripping out features of the technology to leave just
what is necessity. Economists often refer to these as
“frugal,” “jugaad” (an Indian term for non-conventional
innovation) or “bottom-of-the-pyramid” innovations, as
they are produced taking account of local needs and
purchasing power.54
One example of “frugal” innovation is Transsion –
a Chinese mobile phone manufacturer and service
provider based in Shenzhen – which adapted mobile
phones specifically for the African market. While relatively unknown in China, Transsion has captured over
40 percent of the mobile phone market in Africa,
outperforming the likes of Apple, Huawei, Nokia,
31

World Intellectual Property Report 2022

Samsung and Xiaomi, particularly in the lower cost
segment.55 This Chinese company understood the
demand of many African consumers for low-cost
mobile phones, but with a technology that addressed
issues such as weak network signals and coverage
and unreliable access to electricity, among others.
Transsion produced price-accessible phones with an
effective signal reception, long battery life and apps
specifically designed for local market preferences.56

system.59 This private–public partnership – including
a foreign company, a local subsidiary, a local microfinance institution and an established East African
bank – was developed in consultation with market and
non-markets actors, such as microfinance institutions,
NGOs and industry regulators. The Communications
Authority of Kenya, the country’s ICT regulatory body,
was crucial in helping to legitimize the platform and
promote its diffusion.60

Developing economies are also highly heterogeneous,
with a large gap between fast-growing emerging economies and the least developed ones. While technologies from developing economies may be diffused to
others, successful technology transfer depends on the
destination economy’s needs and skills being similar
to those of the source.

Developing economies may also often lack institutions
to facilitate and support innovation, leaving such activities to the informal sector.61 But innovations generated
within the informal sector may have limited scope
to scale up. These types of innovation are often not
documented in scientific articles, technical bulletins or
patents – making them extremely hard to reproduce
and diffuse. They often escape the attention of innovation policymakers, as they are not captured well by the
usual innovation indicators, such as R&D investment,
skilled labor counts or scientific publications and
patents. This is why such local innovations are often
referred to as “under-the-radar” innovations.62

For instance, as an emerging economy known for its
agricultural production and innovation, Brazil’s agricultural technologies could be thought relevant and
appropriate to other developing economies. Several
African policymakers and industrial interest groups
hoped to deploy Brazilian tractors, which are particularly well adapted to large-scale tilled farming areas,
and simple hand-held planters known as matracas,
which can be used on untilled land and in smaller
and scattered farming areas. However, adoption of
the tractors, which require significant maintenance
and training, failed – but the matracas did relatively
well. The characteristics of African agriculture partially
explain these results. It is characterized by small farming areas, relying on low-skilled, abundant labor and
locally-sourced materials, resources and knowledge.57

Solutions must consider
the local perspective
The examples above have a common thread: local
problems require solutions in accord with local conditions. These conditions often include a lack of access to
finance; insufficient energy, transport and telecommunications’ infrastructure; and a scarcity of skilled labor,
to name a few. Innovation in developing economies
must also involve non-market participants, such as
research institutions, government agencies and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), if it is to address
local needs.
An example of a successful innovation adapted to local
social needs is M-PESA, a Kenyan mobile payment
service for people without access to a banking system
and usually operating in the informal sector.58 It leverages short messaging services (SMS) mobile phone
technology to enable secure electronic cash transfer
on almost all mobile phones. The rapid uptake of
M-PESA was due to the innovation being tailored to the
demands of a local market eager to access a financial

Adapting to local needs should not be thought of as
lower-quality innovation. Local adaptation of foreign
technologies can lead to innovations that are equally
valuable for industrialized economies. Such cases
are often referred to as “reverse innovation.” When
U.S. company GE adapted its electrocardiogram and
ultrasound devices for rural consumers in India and
China, it relied on its Indian and Chinese subsidiaries to
re-engineer the technologies to make them smaller and
cheaper. The result was so successful that eventually
GE started selling these adapted units to consumers
in high-income economies as well.63 Other examples
are the Renault Dacia Logan automobile, conceived
for lower-income markets in Eastern Europe and later
successful in France; or Nestlé’s Maggi low-cost,
low-fat dried noodles, first developed for sale in rural
areas in Pakistan and India but which also found strong
markets in New Zealand and Australia.

1.6
The future direction
of innovation
Innovation can certainly assist in solving or at least
mitigating the world’s grand challenges, be it climate
change, inequality, the need for greater food production or better access to water, health and education.
Nonetheless, just raising the general rate of technological change might not be enough. Several of these
challenges resemble public goods, and as a result the
private sector is unlikely to allocate enough innovation
resources to resolving them. Some of the challenges,
notably climate change, cannot be met by private
and public-sector efforts within individual economies
alone. All nations would benefit from climate change

32

World Intellectual Property Report 2022

- related innovation policies, but nobody will benefit if
implemented by only a few. Arguably, the same logic
applies to investment in innovation in any one of the
grand challenges. It would appear, therefore, there is a
strong case to be made for international and multilateral innovation policies that lay down key directions.64
Some hope comes from growing evidence that digital
technologies will prove a new general-purpose technology. A Fourth Industrial Revolution based on these
technologies is likely to produce all sorts of productivity gains across a wide range of industries. They may
prove a springboard for private and public provision of
technical solutions to the health, education and climate
change challenges. They are also likely to transform
how governments design innovation policies and
provide public services in these areas. These questions
are explored further in Chapter 3.

likely to have too little diversity,

These are largely compatible
frameworks referring to a
complex environment of
innovation-related stakeholders.
Edquist (1997), Carlsson et al.
(2002), Bikar et al. (2006), Godin
(2006) and Sharif (2006) provide
comprehensive reviews of the
literature relating to innovation
environments. The main
conceptual frameworks are:
“National Innovation System”
(Pavitt, 1984; Freeman, 1995;
Lundvall, 1988; Nelson, 1993);
“Knowledge-based Economy”
(David and Foray, 1995; Foray,
2018); “New Production of
Knowledge” (Gibbons et al.,
1994); and “Triple Helix”
(Leydesdorff and Etzkowitz,
1996). Founders of the “National
Innovation System” and the
“Knowledge-based Economy”
approaches have discovered a
lot of common ground (Foray
and Lundvall, 1996), once

6

discussion about tacit and
codified knowledge is put to
one side (Cowan et al., 2000;
Cowan and Foray, 1997; Johnson
et al., 2002). Founders of the
“Triple Helix” framework have
suggested analytical similarities
with the “National Innovation
System” and the “Knowledgebased Economy” approaches,
at the same time as claiming a
higher generality (Etzkowitz and
Leydesdorff, 2000; Leydesdorff
and Meyer, 2006).
World IP Report 2019 (WIPO,
2019, Chapter 1) summarizes the
interplay between geography
and innovation. The conceptual
frameworks “Regional Innovation
system” (Cooke, 1992) and
“Local Innovation System”
(Breschi and Lissoni, 2001)
re-conceptualize the innovation
environment geographically
bounded to subnational levels.
The conceptual frameworks
“Sectoral Innovation System”
(Breschi and Malerba,
1997; Malerba, 2002) and
“Technological Innovation
System” (Carlsson, 1997;
Carlsson and Jacobsson,
1997) re-conceptualize the
innovation environment to the
same industries – including
international supply chains – or
to blocks of related technologies.
In the same spirit, the World
IP Report 2017 (WIPO, 2017)
explores how intangible assets
(including knowledge and
innovation) flow within global
value chains.
WIPO’s World IP Report 2019
describes the global innovation
networks that connect the most
innovation-dense hotspots
in the world (WIPO, 2019,
Chapter 1). Several conceptual
frameworks include explicitly the
international aspect of innovation
(see Amable et al., 1997;
Barnard and Chaminade, 2012;
Carlsson, 2006).
Kline and Rosenberg (1986)
define this as “accumulated
knowledge,” to include

10

11

12
13
14
15

16

17

“known science” and “stored
knowledge.” This term
encompasses “the available
knowledge already in the head
of the people in the organization
doing the work.” Schmookler
(1962a) goes further by stating
that “[t]he ‘state of knowledge’
includes not only science
and technology but also any
other aspects of thought,
e.g., art and religion, which
affect Man’s perception of the
material universe.”
Hedy Lamarr developed
several inventions while being a
successful Hollywood actress.
In 1941, she filed a patent for one
of these as Markey Hedy Kiesler,
which was granted in 1942.
Acemoglu (2010) refers
Habakkuk’s claims about the
relationship between labor
scarcity and labor-saving
technologies in the 19th century.
Both Hicks and Marx were
supportive of the notion that cost
of labor and capital – the factor
prices – can induce innovation
(Antonelli, 2009; Dosi and
Nelson, 2010).
See Scherer (1982) and
Schmookler (1962a, 1962b).
See Schmookler (1962a).
See a discussion in
Nelson (2011).
See also Sampat (2015), and
World IP Report 2015 (WIPO,
2015, Chapter 2).
Griliches (1980) found a strong
and consistent relationship
between U.S. companies’
investments in R&D and various
indicators of firm productivity.
Griliches and Lichtenberg (1984)
found a similar result for 193
U.S. industries.
There are the typical caveats
about measuring the direction
of science using large digital
collections of scientific
publications, such as the
Microsoft Academic Graph. In
particular, these collections do
not have a perfect geographical,
language or scientific field
representation. Regarding the

34

25

latter, it is worth mentioning that
the distinctions between different
scientific fields did not exist to
the same extent 200 years ago.
In the 1800s, the publications of
savants readily merged concepts
from modern hard sciences and
humanities. Hence, the figures
are to be interpreted as general
trends and used with caution.
See chapter 3 of the World
IP Report 2015 (WIPO,
2015) for an introduction to
3D-printing innovation.
See Kuhn’s comments to Siegel
(1962) and Multhauf (1959)
about the unprecedented and
increasing closeness of science
and technology since the 1860s.
See Dosi and Nelson (2010), Kline
and Rosenberg (1986) and Pavitt
(1984).
See Pavitt (1984).
Carlsson (1984) documents the
major impact on productivity in
the manufacturing industry made
by this kind of industry.
Joseph Schumpeter (1942)
discusses extensively the
concept of “creative destruction.”
The widening process
corresponds with Joseph
Schumpeter’s early impressions
of new industries composed of
smaller and younger firms. Such
was the case at the inception
of the automotive industry,
when a nascent industry was
nurtured by small, almost
artisanal, workshops competing
to establish their products.
The deepening corresponds
with his later impressions of
the same industries, where
for instance large established
firms characterized the same
automotive industry. Malerba
characterizes these two
processes as Schumpeter Mark I
and Schumpeter Mark II (see
Breschi and Malerba, 1997;
Malerba and Orsenigo, 1993).
“[T]he production of new
knowledge entails significant
externalities that are difficult
to appropriate, thus opening
up a wide gap between social
and private rates of return to
inventive activities. Such a gap,
coupled with acute risk and

the specter of moral hazard
in financing R&D, results in
systemic underinvestment
in R&D, lower than socially
desirable rates of innovation, and
hence slower economic growth”
(Trajtenberg, 2011).
For a discussion on solar panels
in the space industry specifically,
see Chapter 2.
Perez (2003) explores how
in terms of economics
technological trajectories
take the form of long-lasting,
“Kondratiev” waves of
cumulative technology.
See Bresnahan (2010) for a
further discussion on generalpurpose technologies.
Jennifer Doudna and
Emmanuelle Charpentier’s
research on CRISPR (clustered
regularly interspaced short
palindromic repeats) DNA
sequences for the Cas9 protein
provided a platform for genome
editing that revolutionized
biological research. They won the
Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2020 for
their discovery.
Schumpeter (1939) explored the
complexity of the external factors
affecting the interaction between
industrial systems and business
cycles. His considerations are
in line with the systemic shocks
described in this section.
See Gross and Sampat (2020).
The quantity and quality of
R&D resources invested in
different activities are aspects
of the operation of an innovation
system. Integral to the innovation
system concept is how resources
allocated to the advancement
of know-how are organized and
governed (Nelson, 2011).
This adoption-stimulating
mechanism is, of course,
much less direct and certain.
For a discussion, see World
Intellectual Property Report 2013
(WIPO, 2013).
See Arrow (1962) and World
Intellectual Property Report 2011
(WIPO, 2011) for a discussion on
innovation as a public good.
“[I]n the area of policy research
and discussion the last three
decades have been dominated

36

by the argument that market
failures need to be corrected in
order to reach the desirable level
of investments, but where these
investments should go should
not be a concern for policies.
It is much better to leave this
issue to the magical chaos of
the ‘blind watchmaker.’ Any
notion of specialization policy
or top-down strategic initiatives
has become a taboo in policy
discussion, particularly in the
large international policy forums
as well as in the European
Commission” (Foray, 2011).
Ergas (1987) characterizes
these market-neutral policies as
“diffusion-oriented,” in contrast
to the “mission-oriented” policies
discussed in the next subsection.
Ergas (1987: 1).
See Foray (2011), Foray et al.
(2012), Mowery and Nelson (1996)
and Ergas (1987).
See, for instance, the
United States Innovation
and Competition Act of
2021 (USICA) and the Creating
Helpful Incentives to Produce
Semiconductors (CHIPS) for
America Act of 2021.
Mazzucato (2018) proposes
an alternative innovation
policymaking toolkit where
mission-oriented programs
shape existing markets and
“co-create” complementary
markets more than they fix them.
Ergas (1987).
Hertzfeld (2002).
Mazzucato (2018) derives lessons
from mission-oriented innovation
policies. Edquist and co-authors
(Edquist and Hommen,
1999; Edquist and ZabalaIturriagagoitia, 2012) point to
the importance of technological
public procurements. Acemoglu
(2011) predicts that a policymaker
optimizing social returns to
innovation will need to induce a
more diverse innovation portfolio
to generate a growth rate higher
than the market allocation.
See Mazzucato (2018).
Different strands of economic
thought arrive at a similar
conclusion when addressing
issues relating to the grand
35

challenges. But they differ on
how to approach the matter.
See Aiginger and Rodrik
(2020), Rodrik and Stantcheva
(2021), Mowery (2012), Schot
and Steinmueller (2018) and
Mazzucato (2018).
See Diercks et al. (2019), Mowery
(2012), Mowery et al. (2010), and
Schot and Steinmueller (2018).
See Mowery et al. (2010).
Archibugi and his co-authors
(1999) argue that the concepts
of national innovation systems
and globalization of innovative
activities should be analyzed
together, even if they were
developed independently. See
also WIPO (2019).
See also WIPO (2017) and
Kaplinsky (2011) for an
overview of how these less
developed economies were
able to build absorptive and
innovative capabilities.

Parschau and Hauge (2020).
The concepts of “frugal”,
“jugaad” and “bottom-of-thepyramid” innovations tend to
overlap. But there are subtle
differences in the definitions
of these types of innovation.
Scholars define “frugal” as
innovations produced using
locally-sourced and cheaper
inputs, “jugaad” as innovations
meeting the most basic needs
of the poor, and “bottom-of-thepyramid” as those innovations
adapted to the lower purchasing
power of developing economies.
“Jugaad” innovation is essentially
a “frugal” innovation with a
social dimension present. See
Fu (2020), Kaplinsky (2011) and
Martin (2016) for further details.
See IDC (2020) and Deck (2020).
Qumer and Purkayastha (2019).
See Cabral et al. (2016).
M-PESA is a combination of
the Swahili word for cash, Pesa,
while “M” stands for mobile.
M-PESA was launched in March
2007 in Kenya. In its first month
it had registered over 20,000
customers. Two years later, it
had 8 million subscribers with a
network of 13,000 agents. Over

60

61

62
63

64

USD 3.7 billion was transferred
through the platform over those
two years.
The initiative behind M-PESA
came from the British telecom
company Vodafone’s corporate
social responsibility program
to address the United Nations
Millennium Development Goals.
Initial funding for the initiative
came from a public sector
challenge grant, namely, the U.K.
Government’s Department for
International Development (DFID)
Financing Deepening Challenge
Fund in 2003. Vodafone matched
the GBP 1 million award with
in-kind personnel costs. See
more in Hughes and Lonie (2007)
and Onsongo (2019).
ILO (2018) estimates that the
informal sector accounts for
over 85 percent of employment
across Africa.

Chapter 2

What history tells us about
the direction of innovation

During the past century, and in particular after the Second World War, the world has seen numerous
and sometimes abrupt changes in the direction of innovation. This chapter highlights three case
studies that epitomize such periods of change – medical research during the Second World War, the
space race and the initial rise of information technology (IT) industries in East Asia.
The ample data and detailed evidence available for It is important to point out that these case studies differ

on a war footing

As discussed in Chapter 1, economic forces can set
the direction of innovation. The depth and strength
of human curiosity and scientific knowledge act as
guiding compasses for identifying promising avenues.
Market demand also plays a crucial role in incentivizing
the pursuit of certain technological paths. All these
forces can affect decisions about funding and the
allocation of resources.

More than seven decades after the end of the Second
World War, numerous medical innovations developed
to meet battlefield needs are part of standard hospital
practice across the world. Penicillin (see Box 2.1), antimalarial drugs and blood transfusions are examples
of medical innovations spurred on by the needs of the
armed forces but which, in time, became available to
the civilian population and saved millions of lives.

creating and funding the Office of Scientific Research
and Development (OSRD). In particular, it highlights the
efforts of a subdivision of the OSRD – the Committee
on Medical Research (CMR). The OSRD was disbanded
in December 1947, but it has left a strong imprint on
U.S. innovation policy. The formation and expansion
of several current institutions, such as the National
Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Institutes
of Health (NIH), can be traced back to the Second
World War research effort. These efforts produced a
range of technological breakthroughs, including, but
not limited to, radar, the atomic bomb, rocketry, jet
propulsion and radio communications. Finally, the case
study attempts to draw general lessons from these
efforts for innovation in times of crisis.

War demanded cutting-edge technology
It was evident to the U.S Government that the Second
World War was a technological battle and that without cutting-edge military technologies there was no
chance of victory for the United States and the Allied
powers. The OSRD was set up in June 1941 – several
months before the United States formally entered the
war – to mobilize the public and private sectors and
the scientific community to ensure that the military
had access to just such cutting-edge technologies
and knowledge.4

Northern Regional Research Laboratory (NRRL),
a key player in penicillin development, brokered
information-sharing and refereed conflicts that
arose.8 The CMR then assumed a prominent role
in coordinating clinical and field trials. It spent
nearly USD 2 million, about 8 percent of its total
budget, on purchasing penicillin for testing. In
some cases, the Government built the required
production facilities; in others, private firms built
them, confident in the knowledge that there was
a large guaranteed market. Government agencies, including the War Production Board (WPB),
set up to supervise U.S. war production, helped
promote information-sharing and overcome technical bottlenecks in production.9 Antibiotics would
be the biggest selling medical drug for a quarter of
a century after the war10 and the focus of dozens
of follow-on innovations. Throughout the war, the
CMR funded a parallel program to chemically
synthesize penicillin to avoid having to rely on
organic production, which had very low yields.
Although its efforts were unsuccessful, the knowledge developed, as Swann (1983) states, “paved
the way for the general synthesis of penicillin in the
1950s, which led to the development of therapeutically invaluable semisynthetic penicillin.”11

feedback on the performance of their output.
To summarize, the OSRD’s core features included
the funding of largely applied research activities that
focused on crisis resolution, the setting of priorities
in close cooperation with the military and designing
policies (including for patents) to engage the most
capable researchers. Another notable feature was
its willingness to fund multiple rival efforts when it
was uncertain where solutions might lie. This was the
case, for instance, in its malaria and penicillin research.
The OSRD’s involvement was not limited to offering
guaranteed purchases and advance contracts. It also
coordinated decentralized R&D efforts, supporting
not just research but also downstream production
and product adoption and generally prioritizing time
(rapid crisis resolution) over money. In addition to
national efforts, the OSRD was also in charge of
international collaboration, including, for example,
cooperation between British and U.S. scientists in
penicillin research.
44

World Intellectual Property Report 2022

As noted, the OSRD’s influence on U.S. innovation
endured long after the end of the Second World War.
Studies show that overall patenting by U.S. inventors
was 50 to 60 percent higher after the war in the top
OSRD-supported technological categories, compared
with sectors that were not supported. Supported
categories included nuclear, X-rays, communications (e.g., radar and radio navigation), semiconductor
devices (e.g., transistors) and computer hardware and
software.15 In contrast, patenting in France and the
United Kingdom (U.K.), where there was no similar
government support, shows no such trend after the
war. Clearly, the Second World War triggered a marked
shift in the U.S. direction of innovation.

Box 2.3
Vaccines

Role of private sector
From the outset, private firms, particularly in the electric,
chemical and pharmaceutical industries, were highly
engaged in contributing to wartime innovation. The
OSRD and the CMR adopted policies and designed
contracts in a way that was appealing to private firms,
providing funding, reducing the risks of investment
and promoting communication linkages among private
firms. For projects that were not deemed too sensitive
to be made public, the OSRD allowed firms to register and hold patents, although often with the proviso
that they should be licensed to government agencies
when needed.
Nevertheless, at times of crisis, and especially in the
early phases, the scope and boundaries of problems can be vague and evolve rapidly. High levels of
uncertainty may discourage private actors’ involvement. Private-sector participants may hesitate to bear
advanced R&D and physical and human capital costs
without the assurance of a return on their investments.
However, the private sector can also be moved to act
by factors such as altruism or reputational benefits.
During the Second World War, some (though not all)
firms actively sought to contribute out of a sense
of patriotism.18

Even before the Second World War, the U.S.
Government (through the U.S. Army Surgeon
General’s Office and other departments) had begun
research into vaccines for a range of infectious
diseases, including influenza. A particularly virulent
strain of influenza had killed millions of soldiers and
civilians worldwide at the end of the First World War,
with more people dying than during the four years
of fighting. The military performed basic research Participation in wartime innovation efforts could prove

Another critical need during the war was for blood or
blood substitutes to replace blood lost due to injury,
hemorrhage, burns or surgery.23 Substitutes had to
be capable of being easily stored and transported
to distant locations.24 A team headed by the chemist
Edwin Cohen led the research on blood transfusion.
Cohen’s lab isolated the human serum albumin
and tested it in early 1941. By the time of the Pearl
Harbor attacks in December of that year, it was
being used to treat casualties.25 The techniques
refined during the war later became important in
surgical recovery, maintaining blood volumes during
shock, when blood pressure drops sharply, tackling
clotting issues and many other medical conditions,
including treating measles.
Another major figure in this field was Charles Drew,
a U.S. medical researcher. He developed and
improved techniques for blood storage, leading to
the creation of large-scale blood banks in Britain
by 1940.

Hormones
Even before the Second World War, research had
begun on isolating, producing and administering
hormones for a range of diseases and conditions,
from constipation to obesity.26 The CMR ramped
up research on cortical hormones, which helped in
overcoming altitude sickness in aviators and dealing with combat fatigue, treating battlefield trauma
and in surgery.27 After the war, hormone therapy
took off and cortisone became a “miracle” drug
in the decades that followed. Follow-on research
showed that cortical hormones can reduce inflammation and relieve arthritic pain, as well as treating
allergic-type reactions.

Case study conclusions
Crises, such as wars, pandemics and natural hazards,
can be catalysts for technological, market or political
forces that spur innovation. They are a shock to the
innovation system and affect various parameters of the
technological ecosystem. The impact of crisis innovation can be long lasting where demand persists and
the solutions remain applicable. Otherwise, once the
crisis dissipates, so will the impact.
The story of the OSRD is one of crisis innovation, but
with a special characteristic: it had a sole customer –
the military. The OSRD had a top-down, centralized
approach and recruited only a small number of elite
scientists, firms and universities. Other crises, such as
pandemics, might need to cater to a diverse range of
customers. It might then be more appropriate to take
a more decentralized approach and engage a broader
range of collaborators.28

led to them was cumulative and therefore somewhat

Space industry31

A classic case of
mission-oriented innovation
Rapid economic expansion and national security concerns characterized the 1950s and 1960s.
Geopolitical tensions between the United States and
the Soviet Union resulted in military and technological
rivalry. Space programs in both countries were born
out of an ambition to be the first to put a man on the
Moon as a symbol of power and leadership in the
aeronautical and space technology. While the motivation in both countries was similar, their innovation
ecosystems differed. This case study focuses on the
U.S. ecosystem. The Cold War led to an expansion
in U.S. federally-funded R&D, with “mission-oriented”
R&D (such as the mission to the Moon) dominating
the U.S. innovation funding landscape.32 But funding,
although crucial, was not the only essential ingredient
for innovation in the U.S. space program. Technical
ability and organizational capability, coupled with
political will and close collaboration between public,
private and academic entities, were also necessary.
Innovation in space endeavors had two goals. First,
getting into space and, second, being able to function
once there. Technologies developed for the man-onthe-Moon mission had to overcome some special
problems – three in particular. First, there was the question of reducing mass (both weight and volume) (see
Box 2.6); second, there was the need to generate and
store energy (see Box 2.7); and, finally, human beings
and the equipment had to be protected in a harsh
environment. Many of the technologies developed
had later civilian applications that, in turn, gave birth
to completely new technologies. Solar panels, artificial
intelligence (AI) and computer hardware and software
are examples of such technologies (see Box 2.8). These
technologies are also examples of unintended directional change in innovation (see Chapter 1). They are
by-products of intended (mission-oriented) innovation
that later developed in unpredicted ways.

The OSRD’s institutional and administrative approach
to innovation continued to be reflected in the postwar
U.S. innovation system. For instance, the OSRD’s
contracting style, which purchased R&D rather than
specific products – a revolutionary idea for its time –
became the basis for an emerging extramural research
grant program at the NIH.29 The NIH’s postwar, peerreview system was also modeled on the CMR approach.

Role of government
Ever since their inception, space programs in almost
every country have been mainly a national security issue and a symbol of technological progress.
Governments are the main drivers behind two of
the three defining features that set the direction of
innovation in this field – political will and funding. The
third element is the technical ability of, and advances
made by, scientists and engineers in the private
sector and academia. Various U.S. government bodies,
including NASA, the DoD and the Department of
Energy (DoE), have been behind multiple innovations in
the space industry. For instance, the Global Positioning
System (GPS) of satellites, which features in a huge
range of civilian devices, is a U.S. DoD developed,

Box 2.7
Energy storage
Space missions require reliable, consistent and
safe energy sources. Energy-related technologies
and innovations have enabled and enhanced deep
space exploration, human space flight and spacebased terrestrial services. Two energy-related technologies are briefly described below.
Photovoltaics
Modern solar cells that can harness the Sun’s
energy were first developed by physicists at the Bell
Laboratories in the United States in 1953. However,
due to their high price, silicon solar cells could not
find any practical application until the U.S. military
decided, in 1958, that they would be the ideal
power source for Earth-orbiting satellites.36 Since
then, several incremental advancements have been
made to increase the amount of sunlight that the
cells can convert into energy. The percentage of
sunlight converted is known as the cells’ efficiency
(see the graph below).
Despite their ubiquity in space equipment, solar
cells have some limitations. These photovoltaic
systems do not generate energy when in shadow
and their generating capacity declines with increasing distance from the Sun. If a mission requires
continuous, uninterrupted energy, a combination of
energy sources might be more suitable. However, if
interruptions, occasional shutdowns and hibernations are acceptable, solar panels can be an excellent, long-lasting source of energy. The Opportunity
robot rover, one of NASA’s most successful Mars
exploration programs, was launched in 2003 with
an expected lifetime of 92 (Earth) days. It suffered
multiple shutdowns due to dust accumulating on its

owned and operated PNT system. While NASA was
created to conduct all non-military space activity, the
Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), today
known as Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency (DARPA), was set up in February 1958 to
develop space and other technologies for military
applications. Many other space products, such as
remote sensing satellites, which allow, for example, the
remote collection of information about the Earth, have
also stemmed from military needs. Although space
programs have historically had the Government as a
primary customer, there have long been private clients
too. For example, in 1962, a private telecommunications satellite called Telstar, owned and operated by
AT&T, was launched. It even had private insurance
cover and at the time it was famous enough for a
top-selling pop record to be made about it. In recent
years, a new wave of private and commercial markets
have emerged for space products.

solar panels. However, thanks to the winds raging
on Mars, which regularly cleared away these dust
build-ups, the rover operated successfully for over
14 years, 57 times longer than its initial life expectancy.37

conditions. Practical state-of-the-art solar cell efficiency in space is

Nuclear energy
Nuclear power has been seen as a potential energy
source for space exploration since the 1950s. Its
history of performance and reliability seemed to
provide a secure foundation for developing future
uses. However, only a limited set of nuclear energy
technologies have been thoroughly exploited. Several
projects have been terminated due to budgetary and
safety concerns. Radioisotope power systems (RPS)
49

World Intellectual Property Report 2022

are an exception, with hundreds of space applications since 1961.38 The RPS convert heat generated
by the natural decay of plutonium-238 – a radioactive isotope – into electrical power.39 The European
Space Union, the People’s Republic of China, the
Russian Federation and the United States have all
continued to be innovative with RPS technologies,
improving their design and the materials used to
achieve greater efficiency and safety.40

Space private investment booms, but still
outclassed by space public funding
Figure 2.2 NASA outlays and U.S. private
investments on space, 2010–2019

Role of the private sector
Private companies in the United States have always
been integral to space innovation. From the very
beginning, about 80 percent of NASA’s funding has
been spent on contracts with industry. However, as
noted, it is only recently that private companies have
begun to invest in and rely heavily on space systems.
Although private funding has increased drastically in
the 21st century (see Figure 2.2), there is an important caveat relating to private sector investment and
innovation in space technologies. Very few of the
successful “new” space companies operate in a truly
price-driven market. Without sales to governments,
many of these companies would not exist. Space
Exploration Technologies Corp. (SpaceX), which
now designs, manufactures and launches advanced
rockets and spacecraft, had its initial infusion of
substantial funding through NASA’s Commercial
Orbital Transportation Services program in the early
2000s. This provided hundreds of millions of dollars
for a new launch vehicle to resupply the ISS, a collaborative, multinational space station in low-Earth orbit.
SpaceX has been successful in winning very large and
long-term government contracts from both NASA and
the DoD. The company has many private customers
as well. But without the government business, it is
questionable whether there would have been enough
launch business to support these types of products.

also been the main producers of NASA’s astronauts,
with around 40 NASA astronauts being graduates of
MIT, Purdue and Stanford universities.41

Box 2.8
Digital processing, computers and Artificial
Intelligence (AI)
The history of early computers is closely associated with the history of spaceflight. The Apollo
program, launched in 1961 to meet Kennedy’s goal
of reaching the Moon, was the starting point for the
use of computers, microchips and automation in
space exploration.

Role of academia

Microchip technology
Borrowing from aeronautical technologies, space
exploration gradually employed computerized
systems to assist with tasks such as navigation
and guidance. The very high costs of accessing space underscored the need for smaller and
lighter components for onboard technology systems.
Integrated circuits, commonly known as microchips,
have been particularly attractive for spacecraft. They
tend to be notably smaller than traditional electrical
circuits, consume less power, increase operational
speed and offer incremental reductions in costs per
electronic function.42

In December 1958, soon after its creation, NASA
gained control of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL),
a contractor facility operated by Caltech. University
labs have long been one of NASA’s main collaborators.

Most innovations to come out of NASA did not find

However, these innovations proved to be incubators
for several technologies and industries.50 Albeit with
varying degrees of time lag, many of those technologies
have served as the base for derivative, largely unintended and yet immensely important civilian applications. Charged-coupled device (CCD) sensors, which
contain grids of pixels, stemmed from NASA’s goal
to design and build the Hubble Space Telescope,51
a space-based observatory first launched in 1990.
Hubble’s CCD sensors allowed for high-quality deepsky imaging. CCD sensors became a multi-billion-dollar
industry, ubiquitous in everyday products, such as
webcams and smartphone cameras. This is a case
in which the civilian follow-on innovation path that
emerged out of a NASA program was neither straightforward nor predictable.

nature of its development, which means that, as with
IT, some phases can be skipped, facilitating the entry

for smaller developing economies. The next case
study elaborates on these concepts by looking at the
IT industry in East Asia.

2.3
Rise of IT in
East Asian countries
Leapfrogging into the lead
The direction of innovation in East Asian economies
during the past 60 years is intertwined with their
development and economic catch-up stories. These
economies stand out in having nurtured cutting-edge
technological capabilities in several sectors. In recent
decades, the emergence of leading innovators in a
broadly defined IT sector has been a central and recurring feature of the region’s economic development. For
instance, Japan’s industrial rise is closely associated
with its burgeoning consumer electronics industry
in the 1970s and 1980s. The Republic of Korea and
Taiwan Province of China subsequently emerged as
leading innovators and suppliers of semiconductors
and computer monitors. China’s more recent growth
has gone hand in hand with the rise of its communications and Internet-based companies.53
Many of the scientific breakthroughs in and initial
commercialization of products underlying the IT industry took place elsewhere. But the East Asian economies
managed to acquire the knowledge behind these
technologies, “leapfrog” into the latest product cycles
and engage in world-leading product innovation. So
much so that the East Asian region is currently playing
an important role in shaping the direction of innovation
in the IT industry globally.
Characteristics of the IT sector can partially explain
the success of the East Asian region in this sector. It
combines rapid technological change with a short
product life cycle and promises quick and high returns
to investments. Frequent innovation can quickly make
incumbent technologies outdated and therefore lower the
entry barriers for a latecomer. Another prominent factor is
the role of East Asian governments and the development
policies that have nurtured IT innovation in the region.

A return to the Moon is back on the agendas of the
major space agencies, such as NASA and the ESA.
The technical objectives may differ but the competitive pressure – this time from China’s space program
– remains. Moreover, envisioned projects, such as
a mission to Mars or even the creation of permanent human settlements on the Red Planet, require This case study takes a brief historical look at industrial

high-tech investment
East Asia has experienced accelerated growth over
the past few decades, particularly compared to other
regions, notably Latin America and Africa. Although
52

World Intellectual Property Report 2022

initiated at different times, East Asian countries’ steady
growth has been thanks to rapid modernization and
investment in high technologies. Starting with Japan
in the 1960s and 1970s, the main IT products that
East Asian economies produced and exported were
labor-intensive and low-end consumer products, such
as radios, small (analog) calculators, televisions (TVs)
and refrigerators. However, the short life cycle of
high-tech innovation, combined with the interventionist government policies described below, created
windows of opportunity for learning and catching up.
The 1980s saw the East Asians enter the markets for
personal computers (PCs), videocassette recorders (VCRs), audio cassette players and telecommunication equipment, like fixed-line telephone switches and
fax machines. In the 1990s, came memory chips and
wireless cell phones, and the 2000s brought various
digital products, including digital TVs, wireless telecommunication systems and smartphones.
Economists and historians have long tried to explain
the Asian success story through different models,
with the “Flying Geese Model” and the “Best” model54
being the most frequently cited. Japan’s economic
take-off between 1955 and 1975 spilled over into a
similar take-off in the Republic of Korea and Taiwan
Province of China in the 1970s and 1980s. The
“Flying Geese Model” sees Japan as a role model
for economic policy and as a supplier of technology
and finance for the labor-intensive, export-oriented
industrialization in neighboring Asian economies.
This model, however, does not fit the rise of China
after 1980. The size of the Chinese market and the
diversity of industry at various levels of development,
along with the complexity of relations between local
and central governments in China, necessitate two
or more model types.

Despite the variations, the development of all East
Asian economies has common elements. These
include economic catch-up, promotion of the capabilities of private firms and industries, and government measures to reduce the risks involved for firms
entering new industries. This is the “Best” (Beijing–
Seoul–Tokyo) model. Governments promoted their
firms’ capacity building via four avenues. First, they
arranged access to the existing knowledge base and
learning opportunities through, for example, government research institutes and consortiums. Second,
they encouraged export-based engagement with
the global economy as a means of acquiring further
knowledge. Third, they selected industries/technologies for development and promoted import substitution to make their markets less lucrative for foreign
firms. Finally, to avoid companies being restricted to
producing low-margin or low value-added products,
governments encouraged the constant upgrading of
firms’ activities in value-added terms, either within
the same industry or by moving to new, higher valueadding industries. For example, Taiwanese firms
moved from electronic calculators to laptops, because
the old industry had matured and was degrading into
a low value-adding business.

Path-following or path-creating?
Firms can follow different trajectories for catching
up in the IT sector. One way is to evolve from being
a so-called original equipment manufacturer (OEM) –
making components for use by another company – to
being an original design manufacturer (ODM), which
includes both design and production. The final step is
to become an original brand manufacturer (OBM).60 In
the initial stage, a customer – usually a foreign multinational corporation (MNC) – subcontracts the OEMs
to produce a finished product in accordance with
certain specifications. ODMs are more technologically
advanced and can both produce and conduct most of
the product design process, while the customer firm
runs the marketing operation. In the TV industry in the
late 1960s and 1970s, Taiwanese firms were mainly
OEMs. As local Taiwanese engineers working in these
firms mastered the design skills, they left and started
their own original design manufacturing firms.

Looking at strategies for learning and gaining access
to a foreign knowledge base, for example, some
unique Chinese features can be observed. First, there
has been an emphasis on so-called forward engineering, through which new or nascent scientific and
technological knowledge is acquired in university labs
before being applied in a top-down fashion to the
development of commercial products. This is most
visible in the creation of spin-off firms from Chinese
universities, which are discussed further below. This
approach contrasts with the reverse engineering of OBMs work on their own brands, designing and manuthe Republic of Korea and Taiwan Province of China,55 facturing new products, conducting R&D and managing

elements can be considered to comprise the “Beijing”
model, as they have not been explicitly adopted Transition and catch-up can follow the three patterns
by either the Republic of Korea or Taiwan Province listed below.61 First, there is a “path-following” catch-up,
of China.59
which means that the latecomer firm follows the same
53

World Intellectual Property Report 2022

linear path taken by its forerunners, but in a shorter
time. The second pattern is a “stage-skipping” catchup, where the latecomers follow the path but skip some
stages. The third pattern is a path-creating catch-up,
which means that the latecomer firms create their own
path of technological development. For example, in
the 1980s, when Samsung was considering producing
16K-bit dynamic random-access memory (D-RAM)
chips, the technology was going through a period of
transition. Samsung took advantage of this window of
opportunity and skipped directly to the production of
64K-bit D-RAM. In doing so, it jumped ahead of other
firms that, due to inertia, had not yet initiated 64K-bit
D-RAM production.
In general, industrial catch-up processes can be closely
tied to the characteristics of a particular sector. In
sectors where innovations are infrequent and highly
predictable – which is not the case in IT – path-following
or stage-skipping strategies by private firms may be
enough. But in sectors like IT, where technologies are
highly fluid, involve high risks and have large capital
requirements, a successful catch-up may require public–
private collaboration and a path-creating strategy.

Role of government
In the East Asian context, the governments’ role in
steering the direction of innovation is centered on
the development and catch-up phase. Government
policies have aimed at accessing existing knowledge
and reducing uncertainty for local private firms. For
instance, in the Republic of Korea, private firms were
helped during the early days by government research
institutes (GRIs) granting them free or cheap access to
their R&D results. They were also able to participate in
public–private R&D consortiums for their large-scale
and high-risk projects. In 1989, the Korean Government
established a committee for co-development of highdefinition TV, with the participation of 17 institutions,
including private firms, GRIs and universities.
Additionally, Asian governments have provided export
subsidies for local private firms to promote their entry
into the global economy and as a means for them to gain
knowledge. Another notable government intervention
has been through the targeting of industries/technologies for development and by promoting import substitution. They achieved this by controlling the number of
new entrants in a certain sector to ensure that the sector
benefited from stable profits. Entry control has been
one of the key elements of Japanese industrial policy.62

Role of the private sector
The private sector has also been playing a very important role in steering the direction of innovation in
East Asia. Although the timing has been different for

each country, the local IT industry has managed to
catch up and surpass Western IT firms. The transition of Taiwanese private small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) from OEMs to ODMs peaked in
the 1980s in the electronic calculator era. This then
prompted companies like Acer, a Taiwanese firm, and
others to enter the laptop PC and cellphone markets
(see above).63
Korean companies Samsung and LG are among the
leading global technology firms. Samsung started as a
textile and refined sugar company and did not enter the
electronics market until 1969. However, by emphasizing economies of scale, vertical integration and large
investments in R&D, Samsung not only became a large
OEM, but also one of the top global OBMs.
A similar pattern was evident in China toward the end of
the 20th century, with firms like Huawei and ZTE evolving to become leading global OBM firms. In more recent
years, China has successfully generated three giants in
the platform business, where firms harness and create
large, web-based networks of users and resources
that can be accessed on demand. These firms – Baidu,
Alibaba and Tencent – are leading China into the era of
the Fourth Industrial Revolution, and their status and
businesses are considered to be on a par with Google,
Amazon and Facebook.64 Their stellar performance in
the realms of platform and e-commerce businesses is
due to their successful combination of technical ability
and a deep knowledge of China’s large local market.
In other words, they show remarkable agility in both
developing cutting-edge technology and adapting it
to the Chinese context.

Role of academia
East Asian governments have strengthened their
education systems remarkably over the years, from
primary school through universities, which has provided industry with a large pool of skilled labor. In the
early days of technological rise, these governments
supported students going abroad to study engineering and science, but increasingly they have built up
their own strong university systems. This has required
large and ongoing public investments. For instance,
China has put huge emphasis on academia and the
building of basic scientific knowledge. China has also
benefited from a reverse “brain drain,” with many
Chinese graduates from leading Western universities
returning to become professors and/or found their
own companies.65
Many Chinese universities run their own businesses,
which differ from ordinary spin-offs. Not only does
the university established them, but it also staffs,
funds and managerially controls them.66 An example
of a university spin-off is Lenovo, the multinational
technology company, which was founded in 1984 in

of Computing Technology of the Chinese Academy
of Sciences. The first listed software company in
China is also a university spin-off, Dongruan, which is
run by Dongbei University in Shenyang. Universities
and industry have a relatively close relationship in
China, in contrast with the situation in Japan and the
Republic of Korea where historically universities have
had only weak, indirect relationships with industry.
Overall, academia and scientific institutes, at least
in the early stages of development of the East Asian
economies, have not generally been as pivotal in terms
of economic development as government ministries
and the private sector.

Role of intellectual property rights
Intellectual property rights are important in IT technology because products are often made of a slew of
components that rely on a wide range of complex technologies. These technologies are cumulative, rapidly
advancing and have a short shelf life. The technologies
that go into a smartphone, which consists of around
2,000 physical parts, range from semiconductors,
batteries, memory and storage, cameras and sensors
to computer or communication technologies.67
No single firm owns all the patents associated with
these technologies. However, incumbent IT firms tend
to hold large patent portfolios to minimize the need
for third-party patents and to increase their royalty
revenues from firms whose technology might rely on

these patents.68 East Asian economies realized this
early on and promoted patenting by their domestic
firms as they entered and gained a foothold in the
global IT market. For instance, Texas Instruments’
litigation with Samsung over semiconductors in the
1980s spurred the Korean Government and Samsung
to invest heavily in patents. The surge in IT patenting
in East Asian economies is illustrated in Figure 2.3.
Over the past two decades, the geography of standard
essential patent (SEPs) ownership has also gradually
changed, with the emergence of new technologies and
the growth of shared platforms, such as the Internet.
An SEP is a patent that a manufacturer needs to use to
produce a standard-compliant product. SEP holders
commit to license them on fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory (FRAND) terms. SEP holders sometimes
also manufacture the standard-compliant product that
incorporates their own SEPs.69
East Asian economies have come to dominate SEPs in
several new IT technologies, wireless technology being
an example. Several current and future technologies rely
on 5G – the fifth-generation mobile network. Examples
include autonomous vehicles, smart homes and wearable health monitors, which are among those devices
and objects collectively known as the Internet of Things
(IoT). The SEPs necessary for IoT and 5G technologies
are dominated by East Asian companies (for example,
LG, Samsung, Panasonic, ZTE, Huawei, Haier and NEC),
followed by U.S. companies (such as Cisco, Microsoft,
Google/Alphabet, Microsoft, Qualcomm, Apple and
IBM) and European companies (Ericsson and Nokia).

Case study conclusions
Understanding the innovation path that East Asian
economies have taken can provide invaluable insights
for other developing economies. Therefore, it is important to understand the idiosyncrasies, too. First, despite
the rivalry and historical differences among East Asian
economies, technological changes in one have eventually spilled over to neighboring economies. Second,
their technological catch-up has been closely correlated with an upswing of the IT industry in the region.
Technological change in the IT industry has specific
characteristics that facilitate this process. Government
policies were tailored to these characteristics to
promote the building and enhancing of capabilities in
the private sector. Mere replication of these policies
under different contexts in other industries might not
yield the same results. Chapter 1 expands on these
concepts by discussing the current needs of developing countries.

this function cannot be overstated. The main role of
government in both cases was knowledge brokerage –
that is, creating direct channels for communication and
coordination among the participants, which reduced
redundancy and increased efficiency.

A key difference between the three case studies is
the nature of the associated demand. In both the
Second World War and in the space race, the U.S.
Government drove demand as the initial and primary
customer. In the case of IT development in East Asia,
demand was driven by large commercial markets,
both domestic and foreign. The main role of the East
Asian governments was in supporting domestic private
firms with policies that reduced risk and facilitated their
access to cutting-edge knowledge. Another difference
was the speed at which demand had to be met. The
urgency of war meant that innovation needed to be
developed rapidly. While speed was also important

States and the Soviet Union, the timeline of both the

The direction of innovation:
future challenges

As we enter the third decade of the 21st century, new and powerful forces are driving the direction
of innovation in science, technology and medicine. While there are many forces at work, three
stand out.
First, the COVID-19 pandemic generated and, in part,
accelerated demand for new technologies with which
to fight the virus’s spread and treat infection. The
scientific and technological community rose to the
challenge by developing, with significant government
assistance, a range of vaccines in record time. This
global health crisis has profoundly affected how people
work, travel, communicate and entertain themselves.
It is too early to say what the post-pandemic “normal”
will look like, but many changes are here to stay. The
pandemic prompted faster digitalization (discussed
below) and broke many taboos about work and social
life. Innovators stepped in, and will do so further in the
coming years, to supply the technologies needed to
support this new environment.

and their networked character give rise to national
security issues, because of the potential vulnerability of defense systems to hacking, for example.
Governments, in turn, have prioritized the development
of national technological capacity, prompting a new
generation of innovation-oriented industrial policies
around the world.
In light of the forces at work, what directions will innovation take? Most innovation investments set well-defined
end goals, as in the Moon program (see Chapter 2),
which allows predictions to be made about the technological changes to come in the short- to mediumterm. Yet the actual trajectory of innovation remains
uncertain – some end goals will be missed, others
surpassed. In addition, if history is any guide, longterm changes in the direction of innovation and their
socioeconomic consequences cannot be predicted
with any confidence.

Second, fighting climate change has become an
imperative at the top of policy agendas around the
world. Achieving ambitious carbon emission-reduction
targets will depend on innovative technologies and
their adoption. Policy measures and public funding will This chapter examines the three forces outlined

considers the rise of digital general-purpose technologies and how they can trigger the innovations
needed to meet the various challenges highlighted
in this chapter. Section 3.4 distills important insights
from these three case studies to make the case
for governments and policymakers taking an active
role in promoting solutions to society’s challenges,
while at the same time acting to mitigate the possible
disruptive effects of these innovations in areas such
as employment.2 Lastly, Section 3.5 concludes with
some key policy messages.

3.1

The lessons of COVID-19

The spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the early
months of 2020 shook the world. The virus quickly
overwhelmed hospital emergency rooms and intensivecare units and resulted in a high number of deaths
over a relatively short period of time. The World Health
Organization reported COVID-19 responsible for nearly
5.5 million deaths as of January 11, 2022.3 This figure
is widely considered an underestimate.

Public expenditure played a

Governments imposed containment and mitigation measures to stop, or at least slow, its spread.
Lockdowns in many countries saw the temporary closing of offices and factories, other than those providing
key services, and the confinement of people to their
homes. This adversely affected activities requiring a
physical presence, such as those in the services sector.4
Many businesses eventually failed, and many people
lost their jobs. Economists at the World Bank found
that 97 million people were pushed into poverty in 2020
due to the crisis.5 The global economy contracted by
3.2 percent in 2020, arguably the worst recession since
the Second World War.6
The COVID-19 crisis prompted all actors in the innovation ecosystem to urgently find solutions – governments, the private sector, research institutions and
universities, international communities, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), including philanthropic foundations.

Successful public–private collaboration
Concerted efforts by participants in the global innovation
ecosystem led to the development of several COVID-19
vaccines within a short space of time. Less than two years
after the day the first case was reported – December 31,
2019 – 20 COVID-19 vaccines were being administered
globally, 114 vaccine candidates were undergoing clinical
trials and 185 in pre-clinical development.7
The speed at which COVID-19 vaccines were identified, tested and deployed is a record. Chinese scientists published the mapped genetic sequence of the

months later, four companies and one university
had identified their vaccine candidates. On August
31, 2020, the first COVID-19 vaccine, SinoVac, was
approved for use by the Chinese authorities.9 By
early December, the Medicines and Healthcare
Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) had approved
the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine (see below) for use in
the United Kingdom.

Four main factors explain how the vaccines could be
developed so fast.
First, the scale of the pandemic and the fact that it
affected a large share of the global population created
an important incentive for the private sector to find a
technological solution. Market size is an important
factor in innovation, especially in the field of medicine,
because, as noted in Chapter 1, the larger the market,
the bigger the potential reward.10, 11 In assessing whether
to undertake research and development (R&D) investments, innovators have to evaluate the likely costs and
risks of investing against the expected returns.
Second, governments gave significant financial
support to the private sector, including for clinical trials
and for vaccine developers with promising vaccine
candidates, to build large-scale manufacturing capacity. The European Commission (EC), for example,
committed EUR 137.5 million for R&D into diagnostics,
therapies and vaccines and EUR 164 million for startups and SMEs working on solutions to the health
crisis.12 The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness
Innovation (CEPI), a global partnership launched in
2017 to develop vaccines to stop future epidemics,
provided USD 1.3 billion for COVID-19 vaccine R&D.13
In addition, several governments committed to
purchase specific quantities of the vaccine candidates.
These advance purchase agreement (known as APAs)
helped mitigate some of the commercial risks of developing the vaccine candidates. Some of these AMCs
were upfront payments, paid even before a vaccine
candidate had undergone clinical trials.
More public support to address the crisis came in
the form of government-initiated programs, such as
those by the U.S. and U.K. governments, similar to
the mission-oriented policies discussed in Chapter 2.14
These programs were designed to speed up regulatory
assessment, in addition to helping find a vaccine for
COVID-19.15 In the past, even with the most optimistic
outlook, a vaccine would take a minimum 18 months to
develop and market.16 Most took five to 10 years due
to the time needed to find promising candidates and
then gain regulatory approval.17 Box 3.1 looks at the
U.S. Operation Warp Speed (OWS) program of COVID19 vaccine development, while Box 3.2 highlights the
U.K.’s Vaccine Taskforce (VTF).

and the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). Its
purpose was to accelerate the development and
distribution of safe and effective vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics for the SARS-CoV-2 virus,
by coordinating, funding and otherwise supporting vaccine candidate developers, mostly in the
private sector.
The initiative was inspired by the Manhattan Project,
a mission-oriented program which ran from 1942
to 1946.18 The Manhattan Project brought together
scientists and the military, along with concentrated
R&D investments, to create an atomic weapon within
two-and-a-half years. The OWS adopted this same
mission-oriented concerted R&D effort approach,
along with a military operation structure, in developing the COVID-19 vaccine.19
In addition, the OWS program adopted many
of the best practices of the DoD’s Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)
model.20 DARPA was created in 1958 to build up
U.S. technological capacity and compete against
the Soviet Union in a race to the Moon. To do
so, it was prepared to pursue commercially risky
R&D projects. The agency has been successful in
developing important military technologies, some
of which have found a non-military commercial
use (see Chapter 2). The OWS employed DARPA’s
portfolio approach and invested in several vaccine
candidates that relied on different and competing
technologies, albeit with larger R&D investment
and over a shorter and limited duration.21 In doing
so, it raised the chance of funding at least one
successful candidate, while reducing the risk of
overall failure. Firms developing the successful vaccine candidates then competed with one
another to reach the market first.
One novel and innovative aspect of the initiative
was that vaccine developers were able to carry
out the different clinical trial phases concurrently
without compromising the high safety and efficacy standards set by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA). Typically, vaccine and drug
development can only move from one phase to
another once all criteria for progress have been
met. Vaccine developers were also able quickly
to start manufacturing those candidates with the
most promising clinical trial results, as the program
helped build the large-scale manufacturing capacity needed.22
The program was renamed the Countermeasures
Acceleration Group in 2021.

It is a partnership between the Department for
Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) and
the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC)
and includes nine steering group members from
the private sector.

COVID-19. The U.S.’s DARPA was one organization that
had been supporting its development.29 Researchers
were therefore able to re-direct efforts quickly toward
finding vaccine candidates.
Fourth and finally, scientists and researchers that had
never worked with one another started collaborating.30 Some even crossed scientific fields to help with
the endeavor. For example, epidemiologists joined
with sociologists and economists to understand how
the virus spread and how to contain it. In addition,
researchers shared their work openly, even before it
had been peer-reviewed, so as to speed up the diffusion of knowledge between scientists and researchers. This helped in the fast dissemination of the latest
research findings.

The speed of COVID-19 vaccine development shows
how quickly new vaccines and drugs can reach the
market while meeting the high safety standards of
regulators.40 There could be a case to be made for
drug development timelines being shortened from the
industry’s average five to 10 years.
The success of the U.S. and U.K. vaccine development
programs argues for continued public–private partnerships in the prevention and treatment of diseases
such as COVID-19. Both initiatives played pivotal
roles in supporting breakthrough technologies, right
through from theory to practice. They did this by
investing in a portfolio of competing technologies
that were relatively unproven, and by helping build
manufacturing capabilities supporting the application
of those technologies.

Changing medical practice

The pandemic has accelerated the adoption of digital
technologies (see Section 3.3) by medical practitioners
and hospitals. A report by McKinsey & Company in 2021
noted that the biopharmaceutical industry saw more
digital transformation in the first 10 months of COVID-19
than it did in the previous decade.41 Companies in the

The faster the climate changes the greater the impact
on the world will be as there will be less time to adapt
to the changes.
Global warming jeopardizes global economic growth
and, more importantly, the sustainability of life on
Earth. It threatens food security and access to clean
water, and it causes extreme weather events and
rising sea levels. It also hurts plant growth, which in
turn impacts Nature’s ability to regulate CO2 in the
atmosphere. The World Bank estimates the annual
global cost of extreme weather at USD 520 billion in
lost well-being, reflecting the disproportionate impact
of climate change on the poor, with 26 million people
being pushed into poverty every year.45
Governments are coming under increasing pressure
to address climate change. Under the 2015 Paris
Agreement, 196 countries committed themselves to
limiting the rise in global temperatures to less than
2°Celsius (C) by the end of the century and preferably
to halting the rise at 1.5°C.46 Six years later in Glasgow,
Scotland, signatories reiterated this commitment
and a few, including Argentina, China, the European
Union (EU), South Africa, the United Kingdom and the
United States, agreed to stiffen their existing plans
for limiting emissions.47 For example, the EU will aim
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55
percent by 2030 – up from the 40 percent initially
proposed. Many countries – representing 80 percent
of the world economy – have announced targets of
net-zero emissions by 2050, and large emitters such
as China and India have voiced similar goals for 2060
and 2070, respectively.

Progress toward change
Strides have been made by governments and the
private sector alike to direct innovation toward technologies that reduce the adverse impact of economic
activity on the environment. These include in climatechange mitigation technologies for energy, transport
and construction, as well as environmental management and water-related adaptation technologies.
Mitigation technologies aim to reduce greenhouse gas
emission, increase energy efficiency, improve resource
use, minimize waste and improve reuse and recycling.48
Referred to as low-carbon technologies, they generate
relatively lower CO2 emissions than fossil-fuel energy.
In transport, an example would be electric vehicles (see
below). In energy production, examples include solar
photovoltaic (PV) energy, wind turbines and coal-fired
power plants fitted with carbon-capture storage facilities.49 Carbon dioxide removal and capture technologies, for example power plant storage facilities, reduce
CO2 emission by capturing and storing gases either in
reservoirs (geological, terrestrial or in the ocean) or in
products such as wood.50
Governments mostly in developed economies, and
more recently China, are using subsidies, regulations
and standards to promote environmental technologies.
In response, businesses are increasingly investing in
and adopting these technologies. Importantly, governments’ long-term commitment to environmental policies provides an important reassurance to businesses
that they, too, can safely make the necessary long-term
investments in low-carbon technologies.

66

World Intellectual Property Report 2022

Funding for alternatives
Governments have been funding R&D into alternative
energy sources since the 1970s. As part of its Moon
program (see Chapter 2), the United States began
experimenting with solar PV panels and wind turbines
as sources of energy. At the same time, the sharp rise
in oil prices during 1973 and 1979 threatened economic
growth in Europe and North America and raised energy
security concerns. This prompted countries such as
France and Brazil to fund research into nuclear energy
and ethanol, respectively, while Japan initiated energy
efficiency programs.

However, the impact of such policies varies according to the type of incentive – inducement mechanism
– employed (see Box 3.3).58 Technologies at an early
stage of development – basic and/or applied research
stage – tend to be less certain of success and therefore
may require public funding to mitigate the risks.59 For
example, carbon-removal technologies are expensive
both to build and to maintain. While such technologies
have been demonstrated to work, which is known as
“proof of concept,” developing them on a large scale
is risky. Nonetheless, in 2021 more than 100 new
carbon-capture storage facilities were announced with
government backing.60

Governments helped mitigate some of the risks and
uncertainties associated with investing in new, relatively
untested alternative energy technologies. Germany’s
subsidy and feed-in-tariffs policies (see Box 3.3) in
the early 1990s have been credited with creating an
early push in the demand for solar technologies.51 In
addition, government support played a significant role
in developing and demonstrating the practical application of new technologies and, therefore, their potential
for commercialization.

Box 3.3 shows how different inducement mechanisms affect innovation in low-carbon technologies.
Inducement mechanisms are government policies
aimed at producing a specific behavior that may not
have otherwise occurred. In the case of environmental
policies, participants in the innovation ecosystem are
encouraged to work toward developing technologies
(both product and process) that ameliorate carbon
emissions, such as low-carbon technologies and/or
climate-change mitigation technologies (CCMTs).

Studies show that state funding of initiatives positively There are also mechanisms, such as taxes on carbon

away from investments in fossil fuels. According to the
International Energy Agency (IEA), public funding for
fossil fuels declined by almost half in the decade to
2020, from 13 percent down to 7 percent of the total
public R&D spending on energy.55
Box 3.3
Inducement mechanisms and type
of innovation

Standards, rules and regulations
As noted, government standards, rules and regulations play key roles in the adoption of environmental
technologies by both industry and private households.
The number of policies geared to the adoption and
diffusion of environmental technologies has been
growing steadily.56 At the local level, such policies have
included subsidies to install solar panels on rooftops,
construct energy-efficient houses and buildings and
purchase electric-powered bicycles and vehicles. In
response, small communities, farmers, municipalities and environmentally-conscious producers and
households have diversified toward using environmental technologies.57

Studies of climate change policies tend to agree
that the inducement mechanisms which work best
are market based. Carbon-pricing policies, such
as carbon taxes and emission trading systems, are
examples. Firms must price their carbon emissions
into production costs, which they can expect to
rise if they continue to rely on high-carbon technologies. This encourages firms to invest in lowcarbon technologies and facilitates their shift away
from high-carbon ones. Such an investment in
low-carbon technologies helps create a demand
and a market for them. In addition, governments
often receive revenues from carbon-pricing policies, especially in the case of permits. This means
that carbon-pricing policies are less likely to be
67

World Intellectual Property Report 2022

suddenly withdrawn than, say, subsidies, which can
fluctuate with electoral and budgetary cycles. For
firms, the implementation of carbon-pricing policies that penalize high-carbon activities can signal
that a government has a long-term commitment to
carbon-reduction policies.63

CCMT related to energy is the fastest

However, even market-based policies can run
into problems. The German Government relied on
market-based policies to induce investments in
solar PV technology as an energy source. Initially,
it used feed-in tariffs guaranteeing prices for solargenerated electricity higher than those for electricity
generated through conventional fossil fuels.64
But the feed-in tariffs had two major disadvantages. First, they obscured the “real” price of
solar-powered electricity. Second, they did not
necessarily encourage firms to reduce production costs.
Regulators now rely on auctions and other competitive mechanisms in addition to feed-in tariffs. For
example, in Germany’s system of power purchasing agreements or tenders, developers of solar PV
submit bids for new power generation projects,
with the most cost-competitive bids being selected.
Since competition is on price, suppliers and project
developers are motivated to reduce their costs,
which can benefit the whole value chain.

Figure 3.3b Climate-change mitigation

Another instance where market-based incentives
may not work is in the case of renters versus owners
of energy-efficient buildings. If the cost of paying the
energy bill falls on the renter, then the owner of the
apartment or house will have no incentive to invest
in new energy-saving technologies like insulation
or energy-efficient appliances. In this instance,
energy performance standards work better than
energy taxes in stimulating the use of environmental
innovations in buildings.65
Source: Noailly (2022), Popp (2019) and Popp et

al. (2010).

One downside of market-based policies is that they
target technologies and innovations close to commercialization – those that have demonstrated their workability – and do not necessarily stimulate new ideas.
Government support, either through help financing pilot
projects to test ideas or by providing the technological support to develop them, may be better directed
at commercially-risky low-carbon technologies, such
as large-scale carbon-capture facilities. Investment
in new technologies and their development tend to
require government involvement, in cooperation with
universities and the private sector.

Legislation enacted by many countries to induce the

for those technologies. The International Renewable

to develop non-fossil fuel-based sources of energy,
including solar and wind.

Firms in Germany, the United States and Japan were
the early innovators in solar PV. Developments spearheaded by NASA generated important technical progress in solar PV for use in space and eventually on Earth
(see Chapter 2).73 From the 1990s, Germany started
providing large subsidies for solar PV technologies (see
Box 3.3), which, as we have seen, guaranteed higher
prices for energy generated through this method.74
As more countries offered incentives for the production
and consumption of solar PV technologies, production
capacity expanded and more competitors entered the
market. Traditional innovators from Germany, Japan
and the United States found themselves competing
with companies from China and India.75 Today, some of
the largest exporters of solar PV components are firms
from China, the United States, Japan, the Netherlands,
Germany, Hong Kong SAR, the Republic of Korea,
Singapore and Malaysia.76
The expansion of production capacity and the number
of competitors led to significant reductions in the
price of solar PV and boosted market demand for the
technology. The solar PV industry attracted 46 percent
of global investments in renewable energy sources
between 2013 and 2018.77 Over a period of eight
years – 2010 to 2018 – the cost of producing electricity
using solar PV fell 77 percent. Its cumulative installed
capacity had risen by a factor of 100 by 2018 compared
with 2005.78 The IEA forecasts that solar energy will
account for one-fifth of energy supply worldwide by
2050, if solar PV capacity increases 20-fold by then.79
Shortages of solar panel components, due to supplychain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic,
have recently raised the price of solar panels. In addition, trade tensions between the United States and
China may lead to tariffs being imposed on key components. These developments could slow adoption of
solar PV and hurt countries’ decarbonization strategies.

Electric vehicles
The technology for electric vehicles has been around
since the mid-19th century, but their development was
eclipsed by that of petrol-fueled rivals. However, at
the turn of the 21st century interest in electric vehicles
has returned strongly in response to growing concerns
over carbon emission.
Electric vehicles are another example of how governments create early demand for low-carbon technology. Beginning in 2005, the U.S. Government offered

More stringent emission standards have promoted
investments in electric vehicles since the 1990s. By
2030, the EU and the United States are aiming to have
electric vehicles account for 50 percent of automobile
purchases. Moreover, some of their cities, and others
in Canada, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Sri Lanka and the
United Kingdom, have announced a sales bans on
internal combustion engines by 2050.83 These policies
should increase R&D spending in this sector.

Worldwide sale of electric
vehicles is slowly on the rise

Advances in enabling technologies, such as improvements in battery storage capacity, battery thermal
resistance and charging infrastructure, have made
electric vehicles more attractive to consumers. By 2018,

Moreover, clean technologies account for at least half

(see Figure 3.5b).

Figure 3.6a shows how household demand for electric vehicles has been growing. Global market share
of electric vehicle sales has risen steadily since 2011
up to about 4 percent of automobiles in 2019. This is
despite the lower incentives (see Figure 3.6b) provided
by governments, in the form of subsidies for electric vehicle purchases, implying that consumers are
choosing these vehicles regardless. At their peak,
government incentives covered 23 percent of the cost
to consumers of electric vehicles, but had dropped to
10 percent by 2020.

Public and private sectors react,
but constraints remain
Over the last five years, there has been renewed
commitment to addressing climate change from the
private as well as public sector.

Pressure builds on private sector
An increasing number of private and public funds
require investments go into green, low-carbon emission
technologies. Initiatives such as Climate Action 100+,
an investor-led pressure group, and “green” funds try
to persuade the companies they work with to adhere to
climate change goals. There are also initiatives to hold
firms accountable for their green commitments. These
include the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi),
which guides companies in a science-based target
setting, and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial
Disclosures (TCFD), which aims to increase reporting
of climate-related financial information.85

Investments in green funds surpassed USD 178 billion
in the first quarter of 2021, up by nearly 370 percent
from the first quarter of 2020.86 This huge increase
reflects in part the launch during the period of 200
new environmental, social and governance (ESG)
funds – funds that integrate ESG factors into their
investment strategies.
Some public funds are abandoning investments in
fossil fuel companies altogether. The Dutch pension
fund group, ABP, one of the world’s biggest, expects
to sell more than EUR 15 billion of its holdings in fossil
fuel companies by the first quarter of 2023.87
In addition, insurance and accounting companies
are starting to take into consideration clients’ climate
change risk-mitigation strategies when calculating
insurance premiums and values.88 Firms that want to
keep insurance premiums low and values high have
to take climate issues seriously.
71

World Intellectual Property Report 2022

There is also the reputational side to consider. Public
sentiment on climate change has shifted. Younger
generations are much more aware of the issues and
are advocating for change. Companies are taking note.
Traditional fossil-fuel producers BP and Exxon have
climate change activists on their board of directors.

More ambitious government action
Governments are setting more ambitious targets to
meet their climate change commitments. In 2021, the
U.S. Senate approved a USD 550 billion infrastructure
bill to help overhaul U.S. reliance on fossil-fuel energy
for transportation and move toward low-carbon emission technologies. Approximately 13 percent of this bill
will be invested in clean energy transmission through
power grids. It will be the largest investment in lowcarbon emission technology in the country’s history.89
The U.S. Government’s Future of Sustainable Fuels
in American Aviation aims to complement the infrastructure bill by funding and supporting the development of sustainable aviation fuel. It would also require
investments in new technologies to improve aircraft
fuel efficiency.90 In addition, the proposed U.S. Build
Back Better Framework sets aside USD 555 billion for
investments toward fighting climate change.91
In 2019, the EU launched its European Green Deal with
the aim of making Europe carbon neutral by achieving
net zero by 2050.92 The Chinese Development Bank
has set aside RMB 500 billion to fund the country’s
energy sector, of which one-fifth is earmarked to build
clean, low-carbon, safe and efficient energy systems.93
At the intergovernmental level, besides the net-zero
emission targets, the 191 members of the ICAO
endorsed calls to substitute a large share of current
aviation fuels with sustainable fuels by 2050.94
In addition, governments have allied with the private
sector in various public–private partnerships to address
climate change. For example, a private–public partnership between Breakthrough Innovation, a network
established by Bill Gates and several private investors,
and Mission Innovation, a global alliance of 22 countries
and the European Commission, intends to accelerate
the commercialization of critical clean-energy technologies. They include green hydrogen, sustainable
aviation fuel, direct air capture and long-duration
energy storage. The collaboration was established at
the time of the Paris Agreement in 2015 and expanded
at Glasgow in 2021.95
These stronger and deeper commitments from the
private as well as public sectors are likely to encourage further investments to address the climate change
imperative. However, the speed with which these
initiatives translate into significant advances in the

development of low-carbon emission technologies will
depend on many factors. These include political will, the
ability to finance initiatives and access to low-carbon
technologies for countries without the local capacity
to innovate.

Constraints on the uptake of
low-carbon technologies
Our ability to transition to green economies depends
on many factors.
Firms still have a limited incentive to invest in nonpolluting technologies, such as low-carbon technologies,
despite environmental laws and government encouragement. Part of the reason is that fossil-fuel inputs are
cheaper and more widely available. Fossil fuels received
an average subsidy of 10 percent in 2020, which was
passed on to consumers. In 2017, government subsidies
to fossil fuels totaled USD 447 billion. By comparison,
renewable energy technologies received USD 128 billion
and biofuels USD 38 billion.96 Some of this disparity in
subsidies reflects the political complexity of withdrawing subsidies when they are often electorally popular.
Investing in non-polluting technologies is also both
costly and risky, with, as noted, no guarantee of
success. Firms usually take no account of potential
benefits to the economic environment in which they
operate – the so-called “externalities” discussed in
Chapter 1 – or the technical knowledge generated
from investing in low-carbon technologies.97 Firms
tend to focus instead on returns to investment in the
relatively short- to medium-term and not take into
consideration the potentially positive societal implications of low-carbon technology investments for the
environment. This misalignment between private firms’
profit-maximizing objective and society’s overall wellbeing – the private and social returns – is one of the
main arguments in support of government intervention.
By imposing carbon taxes, for example, governments
force companies to factor the costs of their CO2 emissions into decision-making.
Newer, smaller and specialized firms that decide to
invest in low-carbon technologies face substantial
barriers to scaling up their operations. They find it more
difficult to finance their activities than do other small
firms operating in the fossil-fuel business.98 They are
also less likely to be acquired by larger firms.99 An IEA
study followed the development of clean technology
start-ups in 2010 and found that 81 percent failed and/
or exited the market.100 Even those start-ups that do
manage to develop new renewable technologies will
need hundreds of millions of dollars to demonstrate
their commercial viability.101
Firms may hesitate to invest in or shift to low-carbon
technologies, including acquiring firms that specialize

Digitalization is
changing the world
In the summer of 1956, a workshop was organized
at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire,
to discuss how to program machines to gather data,
analyze that data to solve problems and “learn” from
what they had done. The premise of the workshop
was that the process of learning can be described
in sufficient detail for a machine to be programed to
be intelligent.106 Many consider this workshop to be
the birth of artificial intelligence, or AI, a term used
interchangeably with machine-learning technology.
AI is the basis of a new wave of digitalization – digital
general-purpose technologies – that is revolutionizing economic activities. This new wave includes
technologies such as predictive technologies, highly
sophisticated automation and big data.107

The nature of digital general-purpose technologies is
that they are everywhere, spur innovation in complementary fields and can be applied across many
sectors and industries. Previous general-purpose

Digital general-purpose technologies are growing faster than
the average patent filings across all technologies
Figure 3.7 Share of digital general-purpose technologies by category (left), and as a percentage of
all patent filings (right)

Source: WIPO based on PATSTAT.
Note: A patent may refer to more than one category.

As with climate-change technologies, governments will
continue to play a role in the uptake of digital generalpurpose technologies and the spurring of innovation
by investing in enabling infrastructures, such as the
networks needed for 5G wireless technology. 5G technology will deliver data in hugely greater volumes, at
much higher speeds and with much greater reliability,
making possible such revolutionary innovations as the
Internet of Things (IoT) (see below).
In addition, our dependence on digital technologies and
services has increased over the course of COVID-19
pandemic. During lockdowns, consumption patterns
and business activities changed. Consumers made
more home-based purchases and used digital services
for almost everything.111 Businesses able to adopt

technologies in the past four decades, as Figure 3.7
shows. This growth is faster than for IT-related technologies.
However, the influence of these technologies across
economic sectors and countries is uneven. Digitization
of information is an essential component of how these
technologies work. By accessing massive amounts of
information, the technology is able to deduce patterns
from the information provided, and with training learn
to identify specific patterns and trends. But sufficient computing power is necessary to allow for the
processing of large amounts of digitized information.
This requirement could pose further difficulties for
lesser developed economies in competing in the new
economic age.

Innovation becomes a two-way street

Industries that supported remote working, such as
video communication platforms, saw an uptick in their
businesses. Those businesses that did not initiate
remote working, or were unaccommodating, later found
it difficult to get employees back to the office. Many
restaurants and retail stores that required customers
to be on the premises had to shut down.

Digital general-purpose technologies are transforming industries by bringing in new innovators, structures, practices and values. Traditional innovators
face competition from IT-based firms. For example,
traditional automobile manufacturers are having to
compete with Silicon Valley-based technology companies in developing AVs.113

At the heart of these new services are digital platforms,
technology-enabled tools that facilitate transactions
between people (online marketplaces), provide infrastructure to build new products or services (mobile
applications) or create institutional infrastructure (the
database block chain).112

In health, smartwatch manufacturers are measuring
vital health information – daily – which can provide
useful insights during medical examinations. In defense
and logistics, drones are being used for intelligence
reconnaissance and deliveries.114 Even in tourism,
online services and mobile applications (apps) are
ringing the changes, letting people organize travel
in someone else’s car, instead of a taxi, or sleep in
someone else’s house instead of a hotel.

going on – have exploded for digital general-purpose

Improving access to education
Digital general-purpose technologies were already
transforming aspects of teaching. But the global lockdown to contain the spread of COVID-19 quickened
this process. It was arguably the largest educational
experiment ever. The swift shift from in-person to virtual
classrooms prompted changes in how teachers teach
and how students learn. Teachers had to invent ways to
reorganize and create content for the virtual classroom
experience that engaged their students.

Some developing economies may not be ready
to benefit from a Fourth Industrial Revolution (see
Chapter 1).125 The new wave of technological advances
requires major capital investment and a high-skilled
labor force. But low-income economies are characterized by relatively abundant supplies of low-skilled labor
and limited resources for capital investment. In addition, a lack of necessary infrastructure could further
limit the potential benefits of digital general-purpose
technologies in poorer economies.

New research in facial recognition is being tested to
signal to teachers when students are no longer listening, allowing them to adjust their teaching accordingly.
This experimentation will lead to continuous innovation
to provide more personalized education.

As noted earlier, government authorities could use the
huge amounts of data generated by digital generalpurpose technologies to generate important social
returns, such as improving public infrastructure or
tracking the outbreak of diseases in populations.

76

World Intellectual Property Report 2022

But most of the data is held by a handful of large technological companies. These companies collect the
data through the technological services they provide.
Take the example of location apps. A user activating
a location app in Malaysia will be sending information
to servers owned by for-profit corporations headquartered outside the country. The data sent would include
the location, time and the user’s preferred mode of
transport. Public transport agencies and epidemiologists could use the data to help generate analyses
that, in this case, could benefit the Malaysian public.
However, they may not have access to the information, because the data are stored on private servers
in another country.
National security is also a concern in some countries.
The interconnectedness between different digital technological innovations, with devices possibly providing
sensitive information to third parties, calls into question
how secure the technologies are. Governments worry
about the extent to which highly confidential industries
and bodies, such as national defense departments,
should rely on them, given the risks of hacking.
Governments can attempt to direct digital, technologyled innovation in ways that maximize societal benefits,
while safeguarding the interests of the private sector
and markets. For example, governments could seek to
encourage innovations that are job creating or welfare
enhancing rather than job replacing.126 Technologies
that are enhancing include using AI technology to
generate live captioning and simultaneous translations,
which facilitate business transactions, increase productivity and generate economic growth. Technological
innovations that are job replacing could include substituting robots for low-skilled labor, although evidence
that this results in long-term job losses is far from
conclusive. Two studies on high-income economies
find that the adoption of industrial robots – relatively
automated machines integrated within specialized
industrial processes – has led to greater productivity.127
It is unclear whether this findings can be extended to
include poorer economies, where the share of lowskilled labor tends to be relatively higher.
Governments may also have an important role in
data privacy, in particular in deciding what kind of
information is being collected and how it is being
used. Should the data collected from individuals from
different parts of the world – even if anonymous – be
owned by private companies? Could the information
collected be used in a manner that would undermine
market competition? Antitrust authorities in the U.K.,
the EU and the U.S., among others, are investigating
these issues (see Box 3.4).128
The interests of private firms may not align with what
society needs. Could access to private citizens’ data,
collected using privately-owned technologies, be
governed in a way that ensures the widespread societal

benefits of harnessing digital technologies for innovation, while respecting privacy and national security
concerns? There are no obvious answers or solutions
to this question. But the existence of concerns provides
some justification for governments to intervene.

Box 3.4
Big tech firms: anti-trust concerns
Google/Alphabet, Apple, Facebook/Meta, Amazon
and Microsoft own the world’s most frequently used
digital platforms.129 These five IT-based companies
provide different and competing services, including
search engines, social networks, smart devices,
such as wearable devices, cloud computing and
more. Their business models are different. Google
is a search engine that generates revenues by selling targeted advertisements. Amazon is the digital
equivalent of a traditional retailer, selling merchandize through its platform.
The fast pace of technological development and
the integrated nature of the digital market pose
some challenges for competition law and policy.
Their adaptation to new market realities and business models is critical to ensuring competitive and
contestable markets.130
These five providers control substantial market
power, especially in the digital market. Due to their
vertically-integrated platforms, the information
these firms gather from users could be leveraged
to optimize downstream products and services.
From an economic efficiency view, this is a welcome
development. Product bundling, such as the interoperability between apps and payment methods for
the app, is often in the interest of consumers and
app producers alike.
From an anti-trust standpoint, a few firms controlling a large share of the economic system may be
detrimental to further innovation and future economic
growth. It raises competitive issues about whether
leveraging market power in an upstream vertical
segment might stifle competition and innovation
downstream. For example, by using data collected
from past user purchasing patterns on the digital
platform to offer similar but competing products from
the parent company of the digital platform, or selectively displaying those products ahead of others.
There are several economic arguments to counter
suggestions of an anti-trust threat from the digital
platforms. These companies are continuously innovating and competing with one another.131 There is
no barrier to entry in the traditional anti-competition
sense. It is relatively easy for new products or new
competitors to enter the market, and the costs are
77

World Intellectual Property Report 2022

arguably low. Any IT firm can arguably set up its
own digital platform and consumers can switch
from one digital platform to another. Many of these
services are provided at no monetary cost to the
consumer. That said, these big firms may have a
significant competitive edge over new rivals with
regards to their first-mover advantages, such as
with the creation of a product ecosystem and
user lock-in. Users may be reluctant to choose
a different platform, because they are used to
the current one and the costs of switching may
be burdensome.132
Moreover, digital platforms are only as good as
the number of services they offer on their platform,
which in turn is linked to the number of users. More
apps imply more users and more users attract
other app producers to build on the digital platform. Moreover, consumer data has become an
important source of competitive advantage in many
digital markets. So, attracting and having a critical
volume of services and users may in some sense
be considered a barrier to entry.
Several competition authorities are studying digital platforms from an anti-trust perspective.133
Investigations by a select few include focusing on:
– the digital platforms’ search results, because they
are “self-preferencing” of their own products and
services;134
– platforms’ anti-competitive behaviors to preserve
their market power;135 and,
– mergers and acquisition activities to remove
potential rivals.136
But how are competition authorities to address
any anti-trust issues in this market? They may
not have the capacity to deal with these giant
technological firms and the complexities of their
vertically-integrated platforms.137 Moreover, any
judgement may be difficult to implement and could
even harm competition.138

3.4
Public policy can harness
innovation to address the challenges
The process of innovation involves the interdependence
or interaction of different stakeholders in the innovation ecosystem. In climate change, the interdependent
behavior of a variety of actors influences the direction and pace of green technology innovation. These
actors include start-ups specializing in environmental
technologies, firms in the energy sector, government
institutions, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, and universities, as well as intergovernmental
organizations, such as the UNFCCC.

This section focuses on government action.
Governments can get involved in various ways, from
financing research to imposing regulations or setting
targets to change the direction of innovation, as seen
in the discussion of health (COVID-19), climate change
and the rise of digital general-purpose technologies.

Encouraging innovation
for society’s benefit
Governments may wish to influence the direction
of change to maximize societal benefits. There are
generally three arguments in favor of policymakers
doing so.
When the needs of society and the goals of for-profit
private companies are misaligned, governments can,
and probably should, step in. This is particularly the
case, as we saw in Chapter 1, when the social returns
to or benefits from addressing society’s needs – to
contain pollution, for example – far outweigh the private
returns to continuing with business as usual.
In the case of climate change, government programs,
policies, rules and standards are playing an important role in directing innovation toward mitigation
technologies. With digital technologies, governments
may seek to avert or soften potentially negative
impacts, especially when the increased use of AI, for
example, is likely to lead to big job losses, or where
there might be data privacy, competition or national
security issues.
Due to market competition, firms tend to invest in
innovation activities that yield the highest payoff in the
shortest time. Established firms avoid innovation activities that are risky and uncertain. This explains why most
of the climate-change mitigation technology breakthroughs are by new-to-the-industry start-up firms.
In the biomedical field, firms will look to make
investments in activities likely to have relatively
immediate commercial applications.139 This includes
instances where pharmaceutical companies prefer to
re-purpose existing technologies in order to continue
treating diseases rather than invest in vaccines or
new medical cures. For society, investing in medical research with a longer-lasting impact, but which
requires more time and effort to materialize, is far
preferable to re-purposing existing treatments
and technologies.
Governments may need to react to crises with
programs or initiatives. With the COVID-19 vaccine,
the large amount of funding and support provided
in finding ways to mitigate the impact of the SARSCoV-2 virus quickly is justified by the importance of
finding a solution.140 Government support in developing and manufacturing vaccines on a large scale
78

World Intellectual Property Report 2022

was key to their rapid deployment. Both the U.S. and
U.K. initiatives (see Boxes 3.1 and 3.2) supported
vaccine development, from the initial R&D into likely
candidates, through their testing and final approval by
regulatory agencies to the scaling up of production
and distribution of the vaccines. Even those vaccine
investments that led nowhere, because they proved
unviable, cannot be regarded as money wasted,
given the huge uncertainty at the beginning as to
what would work.141
Similar governmental support in addressing climate
change could be important in helping achieve the less
than 2°C global warming target set for the end of the
century. But action is needed at all levels, from the
multilateral down to individual households. A report
by the IEA recommends drastic changes to meet
the goal set by governments in 2015 and reaffirmed
in 2021.142 Investment in low-carbon technologies
should more than triple to around USD 4 trillion a
year by 2030, it says. All sales of internal-combustion
engine passenger cars should stop by 2035 and all
coal and oil power plants be phased out by 2040. In
short, a complete transformation of the global energy
system is needed.143

battery-charging stations to encourage the use of
electric vehicles. The potential benefits of investments made by the United Kingdom and United States
governments in their countries’ capacity to manufacture cutting-edge technology to combat COVID19 could leave them well placed to react to similar
pandemics in the future.
Box 3.5 provides an overview of selected government policies that target specific innovation activities
considered critical for economic growth.

Box 3.5
Selected government policies for building
innovative digital capacities
USICA145
The U.S. Innovation and Competition Act (USICA)
of 2021 is one of the biggest industrial legislative
proposals in U.S. history. It “aims to strengthen U.S.
innovation ecosystems through new investments in
research, commercialization and manufacturing.”
Key policies include:
-

Shaping the direction of innovation
Governments can impose rules and regulations that
drive the private sector toward investing in certain types
of innovation. In the case of climate change, policies
such as carbon pricing are playing a role in inducing
the private sector to adopt low-carbon or carbonmitigation technologies.

-

Similarly, for the new digital technologies, governments can regulate the use of data collected from
users. The EU’s General Data Protection Rules (GDPR)
are designed to prevent the misuse of information
from private citizens, for example, for commercial
marketing purposes or for unauthorized tracking of
a user’s movements. Intellectual property protection policies define what digital general-purpose
technologies may or may not be patented – or rather,
they do up to a point. AI can generate new inventions.
However, in many jurisdictions, patents may only
be applied to inventions made by humans. Those
created by sophisticated computer algorithms are
not covered.144 AI-generated innovation may have to
rely on other IP instruments, such as trade secrets,
to ensure protection from imitation.
State investments in enabling and/or complementary
technologies and infrastructures can facilitate the
uptake of innovations in critical fields. For example,
upgrading electricity grids to enable greater use of
renewable energy sources could quicken the uptake
of climate-change mitigation technologies and reduce
CO2 emission. Governments could invest in building

substantial funding for scientific research and the
production, sale and licensing of specific technologies to consumers in critical fields, such as
AI, robotics, 5G telephony and semiconductors.146
Part of the funding would go to broadening
education in science, technology, engineering
and mathematics (STEM).
ensuring continuity of supply chains for access
to raw materials, for example; and
establishing technological hubs in different parts
of the United States to build capacities in those
regions and stimulate economic growth.

Made in China147
“Made in China 2025” is a 10-year strategic plan,
launched in 2016, to move China up the global value
chain and make it one of the frontier economies in
technologies. It will achieve this by:
-

-

developing manufacturing capability in cuttingedge advanced technologies (namely, digital
general-purpose technologies);
prioritizing technologies relating to 10 fields: IT,
robotics and automation, aerospace and aviation
equipment, maritime engineering equipment and
high-tech vessel manufacturing, rail equipment,
energy-saving vehicles, electrical equipment, new
materials, biomedicine and high-performance
medical apparatus, and agricultural equipment.

Horizon Europe148
“Horizon Europe” is an EUR 100 billion research and
innovation funding program that runs until 2027. It
aims to build, develop and strengthen Europe’s
79

World Intellectual Property Report 2022

scientific and technological knowledge base. It
has four pillars:
-

building the EU’s scientific competitiveness;
investing in research to address societal challenges and strengthen industrial capacities;
fostering the integration of education, research
and innovation to facilitate innovation; and
supporting EU members in building their innovative capacities.

Industry 4.0
Germany’s “Industry 4.0,” announced in April 2013,
is a strategic plan for manufacturing that focuses on
the digital transformation of the German economy. It
covers fields such as industrial integration, industrial
information integration, manufacturing digitization,
the IoT and AI. Its basic mission is to take German
industry into the digital age.

3.5
Conclusions and
policy recommendations
The case studies on the COVID-19 crisis, the climate
change imperative and rise of digital general-purpose
technologies have shown how the direction of innovation has changed and will continue to change. They
also suggest how public policies can steer innovation
in a direction that best responds to societies’ needs.

Policymakers should focus not only on how much
is invested, but also in which areas.
• Policymakers have limited influence over the longterm direction of innovation, because long-term
technological opportunities are unpredictable.
However, through funding of basic science, governments play a crucial role in enabling scientific
and technological breakthroughs that shape the
future direction of innovation (even if in uncertain,
unpredictable ways).
• Government policy shapes the direction of innovation in the short- to medium-term by:
– aligning private innovation incentives with societal needs;
– implementing policies that regulate new technologies (especially digital general-purpose
technologies) and which can shape innovation and the adoption of new technologies.
Examples include data governance, competition and even IP policies. However, a balance
must be struck between facilitating innovation, promoting competition and protecting
privacy rights;
– funding education, health, infrastructure
and other public goods. For example, digital
general-purpose technologies offer a significant opportunity to improve education and
health outcomes.

In the case of COVID-19, governments helped reduce
investment uncertainty and mitigate the risks associated with first discovering and then developing a vaccine.
In climate change, government policies, standards,
rules and regulations are helping direct companies and
households toward greener technologies. Finally, in the
case of digital technologies, governments invested in
and built enabling technologies – and in the case of 5G
are continuing to do so – that facilitated innovations
and their adoption.
It is difficult to say whether similar progress would
have been made without government support. There
is no comparable counterfactual. But there are strong
arguments in support of the positive impact of government action in the speed and direction of innovation.
Moreover, governments are uniquely placed to preempt
any potentially negative impacts of innovation, for
example, on employment, and to create the right
incentives and enabling environment to promote and
harness its potential.
Lessons learned through these case studies point to
several key policy messages:
• The direction of innovation matters, because
resources to invest in innovation are scarce.

of applications. In trying to
distinguish between the two, the
co-authors alternate between
categorizing AI and its related
technologies as digital generalpurpose technology (GPT)
or “invention of a methods of
inventions.” They settled for GPT
IMIs. Nonetheless, these digital
technologies can influence the
direction of innovation over the
long-term.

technologies are extensions of

Technical notes

Patent data

Digital-general purpose technologies

The patent data used in this report are from the
European Patent Office’s (EPO) Worldwide Patent
Statistical Database (PATSTAT, October 2021) and
WIPO’s Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) collections.

The digital-general purpose technologies mapping was
based on the following strategies for subcategories.

The main unit of analysis is the first filing for a set
of patent applications filed in one or more countries
and claiming the same invention. Each set containing
one first and, potentially, several subsequent filings is
defined as a patent family.

Mapping strategies
The patent mapping strategy for each of the case
studies – digital-general purpose technologies and
low-carbon technologies – is based on prior studies
and experts’ suggestions. Whenever possible, each
strategy relied on and was compared to existing equivalent patent mapping exercises. The summary of these
can be found as follows, for more details please see
Noailly (2022), and Trajtenberg, Hamdan-Livramento
and Daly (2022).
The mapping strategies is based on a combination
of patent classifications – namely, the International
Patent Classification (IPC) and the Cooperative
Patent Classification (CPC) – and keywords applied
to PATSTAT data.
