77th Annual Report

submitted to the Annual General Meeting
of the Bank for International Settlements
held in Basel on 24 June 2007

Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is my pleasure to submit to you the 77th Annual Report of the Bank for
International Settlements for the financial year which ended on 31 March 2007.
The net profit for the year amounted to SDR 639.4 million, compared with
SDR 599.2 million for the preceding year. Details of the results for the financial
year 2006/07 may be found on pages 182–4 of this Report under “Net profit
and its distribution”.
The Board of Directors proposes, in application of Article 51 of the Bank’s
Statutes, that the present General Meeting apply the sum of SDR 139.3 million
in payment of a dividend of SDR 255 per share, payable in any constituent
currency of the SDR, or in Swiss francs. This year’s proposed amount compares
to the dividend of SDR 245 per share paid out last year.
The Board further recommends that SDR 50.0 million be transferred to the
general reserve fund, SDR 6.0 million to the special dividend reserve fund and
the remainder – amounting to SDR 444.1 million – to the free reserve fund.
If these proposals are approved, the Bank’s dividend for the financial year
2006/07 will be payable to shareholders on 2 July 2007.

I. Introduction: piecing the puzzle together

The performance of the global economy over the last few years has been
extraordinary, and this includes the period April 2006 to May 2007 under
review in this Annual Report. First, and most importantly, real growth has
been maintained around levels that are among the highest recorded in the
postwar period. The fact that many of the world’s poorest countries have
shared in this growing prosperity has been another welcome feature. Second,
notwithstanding this rapid growth and despite significant upward shocks
to most commodity prices, underlying inflation levels have generally
remained subdued. Third, real interest rates and risk premia of all sorts have
remained uncharacteristically low. And finally, record global trade imbalances
have thus far been easily financed and exchange rates have been generally quite
stable. In isolation, each of these outcomes might be welcomed without further
reflection. However, the combination of developments is so extraordinary that
it must raise questions about the source and, closely related, the sustainability
of all this good fortune.
A variety of hypotheses have been suggested to explain subsets of these
phenomena, but each falls short of explaining them all. For example, the idea
of a global “investment strike” has merit when attempting to explain worldwide
low inflation and low interest rates. However, it is more difficult to reconcile
this hypothesis with the recent record rates of real growth. The idea that
“globalisation” is a positive supply side shock driving down inflation also
appeals, but what have been the forces simultaneously driving up demand and
global growth? Simply asserting that supply creates its own demand, certainly
arguable as a short-run proposition, also ignores an important fact. While
emerging market economies have been the source of a large part of the supply
side shock, it is the advanced industrial countries, above all the United States,
that have accounted for most of the increase in demand. What influences
could have led to this asymmetric outcome, and the associated imbalances
in global trade? Finally, the “credibility” of vigilant central banks might well
have helped explain both low inflation and high real growth for an extended
period of time. But surely this cannot be the whole explanation, given that real
interest rates have remained so low, and the rate of credit creation so high, for
almost all of this decade.
Yet, if individually each of these hypotheses has its shortcomings,
together they might well provide a coherent explanation of the favourable
global performance seen over the last few years. Begin with the investment
strike hypothesis, that is, a deficiency of ex ante fixed investment relative to a
high level of ex ante saving. Arguably, the chief factor behind this shortfall in

BIS 77th Annual Report

recent years has been subdued investment rates in many countries following
earlier boom-bust cycles. Corporate investment has only begun to pick up in
Japan and Germany over the last year or so, and is still showing scant sign of
doing so in Southeast Asia. Moreover, as a proportion of GDP, corporate
investment has remained very weak in the United States in the aftermath of
the “new era” bubble of the late 1990s. Against this backdrop of generally
weak investment demand, the global economy was simultaneously affected
by a significant increase in supply. Globalisation and the re-entry of previously
centrally planned economies into the liberalised trading system were key factors.
But, in addition, increases in productivity associated with technological
advances also played a role, particularly in the IT and distribution sectors. And
the interaction of these phenomena with the credibility gained by central banks
in fighting inflation in the 1980s added still further disinflationary momentum
to the global economy.
In view of the very low levels of inflation arising from these joint
developments, and indeed concerns about deflation in some countries,
monetary policy in the advanced industrial countries has been unusually easy
for a number of years. This tendency was reinforced by the perceived need to
react to financial disruptions in 1997 (the East Asian crisis) and 1998 (the
LTCM crisis), and to the sharp fall in global stock markets in 2001. Such
monetary ease in the industrial countries might have been expected to lead to
lower exchange rates, complemented by a rise in the exchange rates of
emerging market economies. However, with emerging market economies also
facing an environment of low inflation, and with many countries wishing to
build up reserves to “self-insure” against future crises, there was a shared
unwillingness to allow this adjustment to occur. Massive sterilised intervention
was carried out, particularly in Asia, and domestic monetary conditions were
also kept very loose. And, as the accumulated reserves were reinvested,
they supported the US dollar and added to the already ample liquidity in the
financial markets of the industrial countries.
Nor have these been the only forces acting to stimulate global monetary
and credit expansion over the last few years. Analogous to the profound
structural changes affecting the real economy, the financial sector has also
been undergoing a massive transformation. New technologies for managing
risk, new instruments and new players have been increasingly in evidence,
with competition demanding that every possible financial opportunity be
exploited to the full in the search for yield.
These monetary and financial developments have stimulated aggregate
demand to match the increases in global supply. This Introduction will describe
how these individual pressures, the pieces of the puzzle, have contributed
to this success over the last year or so. Yet this success must be qualified by
at least two observations that will be returned to in the Conclusion of this
Annual Report.
First, there is at least a possibility that the massive financial stimulus
provided to spending might have inadvertently tipped the global economy, or
significant parts of it, into a situation where inflationary pressures might again
be resurgent. Second, in part as a by-product of all this monetary and financial

4

BIS 77th Annual Report

stimulus, an ever increasing number of economic and financial variables have
been observed to deviate significantly from what might be deemed traditional
“norms”. In particular, easy financial conditions have led to an unprecedented
drop in the household saving rate in the United States and an equally
unprecedented rise in the investment rate in China. Whether these will
eventually prove sustainable, with new “norms” being generated consistent
with underlying structural changes, or whether they will rather prove subject
to a more traditional form of mean-reversion, remains to be seen.

Demand and supply side considerations
Over the last 12 months or so, the global economy has continued to expand
rapidly, with virtually no region failing to feel the benefit. China and India
continued to grow at breakneck speed, drawing much of Asia along with them,
while oil producers generally set records in terms of national income growth.
With a few exceptions, countries in Latin America and central and eastern
Europe also prospered. Based partly on better macroeconomic management,
but also on higher commodity prices, growth in large parts of Africa was also
maintained at atypically high rates.
The major industrial countries also fared very well, indeed giving further
evidence of a welcome rebalancing as growth in Japan and the euro area
accelerated further and domestic demand growth in the United States began to
moderate. Germany in particular emerged from its long period of torpor with
unexpected vigour. However, as the period under review wore on, concerns
began to mount that the US economy might slow excessively, with potential
implications for growth elsewhere. In the United States, consumption spending
began to falter only after very rapid gains. While some deceleration was then
to be expected, the fact that income and employment growth had not kept up,
and that much consumption was financed through debt and lower saving,
probably also played a role. A particular concern was a possible link with the
US housing cycle, which began to turn down sharply in early 2006.
Throughout this last year, US housing starts fell precipitously as the ratio
of inventories of unsold houses to sales rose to levels not seen since the
early 1970s. While the full impact on employment in the construction sector
has not yet been felt, the simultaneous sharp deceleration in house prices has
begun to have some implications. The capacity of consumers to use higher
house values as collateral to support borrowing and spending has clearly
diminished. Closely related, some borrowers with less than prime credit status
were only able to service their mortgages through similar refinancing. With this
avenue closed to them, many may lose their homes and the inventory of unsold
houses could then rise further. Fortunately, there is no firm evidence to date
that these developments have undermined general consumer confidence in the
United States, even if some greater constraints on the availability of consumer
credit are beginning to be put in place.
Although it had been hoped that corporate investment in the United States
might offset the drag from the housing market, investment fell back near the
end of 2006. To many, this was surprising since capacity utilisation was rising,

US corporate profits were very high and financing conditions were still
supportive. Moreover, there was evidence of resurgent investment and
business confidence, if not yet consumer confidence and spending, in other
advanced industrial countries such as Germany and Japan. Yet investment
must be based on expectations of rates of return, and here perhaps the omens
were less positive. US productivity gains slowed in 2006, the pace of wage
increases picked up and the rate of profit growth in the non-financial sector
decelerated rapidly. Looking forward, a concern that US domestic consumer
demand might falter, just as many of China’s recent massive investment
projects come on line, might also have had a restraining influence on profit
expectations. And, perhaps, not only in the United States.
Certainly, the rising global influence of China and India is becoming
increasingly hard to ignore. Investment spending in China, much of it exportoriented, amounted to almost 45% of GDP last year. Moreover, Chinese firms
continued to move rapidly up the value chain, and are now extending into
service areas which had previously been thought non-tradable. India too
continued to expand its export sector last year. Indeed, evidence emerged that
it was moving more aggressively into manufacturing to complement the IT
services for which it has become well known. Chinese and Indian companies
have both begun to make substantial direct investments in companies abroad,
with the former reportedly particularly intent on ensuring the sustainability of
future commodity supplies.
Rapid productivity growth in China allowed both wages and profits to
increase strongly in aggregate, while maintaining competitiveness, but concerns
were again expressed that wages were not being adequately transformed into
domestic consumer spending. The fact that profits seemed to be increasingly
concentrated, while investment growth was widespread, also raised fears of
excess capacity and further reliance on exports should domestic investment
falter. The Chinese government took administrative and monetary measures
in the course of the year to slow the economy, but growth expectations
nevertheless continued to be revised up during the period under review. In
India, monetary policy was also tightened, but the economy continued to grow
very rapidly.
Against this backdrop, global headline inflation moderated further in the
past year, but with a partial reversal of the earlier spike in energy prices
playing a key role. Core inflation in China, Japan and some continental
European countries was relatively low and stable, although a number of
emerging market economies in Asia and Latin America experienced either high
or rising inflation. In the United States as well, some saw an unwelcome, if
slight, upward drift. Yet in countries, including the United States, where surveys
or financial markets provided information about longer-term inflation
expectations, these expectations remained quite stable. Nor, during the period
under review, did any firm evidence emerge that the recorded decline in
inflation volatility in recent years, as well as in the pass-through to inflation of
cost-push shocks, was beginning to reverse.
It was nonetheless rather surprising that the stable inflation picture in
industrial countries was maintained last year given evidence of shrinking global

6

BIS 77th Annual Report

capacity gaps. By the end of 2006, many Japanese officials considered that the
economy was operating above full capacity, the US authorities estimated that
the country was at full capacity, and the euro area in aggregate was thought
to be approaching full capacity as the result of an earlier sharp fall in the
unemployment rate. While rising and stable unit labour costs in the United
States and many European countries, respectively, might be seen as consistent
with these developments, the continuing weakness of German and Japanese
wages has been remarkable. Finally, it became increasingly doubtful, over
the year, whether the previous impetus for global disinflation coming from the
emerging market economies was being maintained. During the year, both
the Chinese and Indian authorities made reference to overheating at home
and, as noted above, took concrete steps to offset it.
Commodity prices both helped and hindered the continued moderation of
inflationary pressures over the last year. It was certainly helpful that energy
prices fell back, after a sharp run-up in the first half of 2006. Less helpful was
the persistently high level of many other commodity prices, in part reflecting
rapidly rising costs of exploration, extraction and processing. Perhaps least
helpful was the increase in the prices of a number of staple foods, as a result
partly of drought, but also of moves to diversify crops away from food towards
fuel production.

Monetary and financial conditions
Against this backdrop of strong growth but still low inflation and stable
inflation expectations, monetary policy in the industrial countries tightened
moderately. Policy rates in the United States, which had been raised at a
measured pace from early 2004, remained unchanged from June 2006. Policy
rates were increased more substantially by the ECB, in the period under
review, albeit from a low level. In Japan there was an end to the zero interest
rate policy, but the policy rate rose to only 0.5% in February. Real policy rates
(ex post) also rose and are now around the level of estimated potential growth
in the United States and the euro area, but still well below it in Japan.
By some measures, however, overall monetary and financial conditions
remained highly accommodative in the industrial countries. Credit growth in the
G3 peaked at around 10% in mid-2006, and then decelerated only very slightly.
Real long-term rates also rose, but much less than policy rates. Indeed, at the
end of the period under review, they were no higher than they had been in
mid-2004 when the tightening phase began. Some commentators noted that
an inverted yield curve had been a reliable indicator of imminent recession in
the past. However, others preferred a different interpretation: the latest decline
in long rates seemed to an unusual degree to indicate a decline in term (risk)
premia, rather than the expectation of lower future short rates.
This “conundrum” concerning the term premia on long bond rates could
partly reflect the stimulative influence of monetary authorities worldwide,
together with a marked willingness on the part of both the private and public
sectors to accept exchange rate risks. Relatively low policy rates in many parts
of the industrial world, but particularly in Switzerland and Japan, contributed to

BIS 77th Annual Report

a continuing high level of capital inflows into a number of emerging market
economies and also into other industrial countries with higher yields. Outright
“carry trades” involved borrowing in low-yielding currencies to invest in highyielding currencies, but also in countries where asset prices or currency values
were expected to increase. And a variety of other flows played similar roles,
notably large-scale Japanese retail outflows, and household borrowing in
foreign currency to finance mortgages in central and eastern Europe. While
improved macroeconomic fundamentals, in particular trade surpluses, in many
recipient countries were also cited as a factor, others had sharply deteriorating
current accounts and sometimes other negative indicators.
These capital inflows took various forms, adding to the upward pressure
on equity and property prices already being exerted by relatively loose
domestic monetary conditions. For countries that had experienced earlier crises
associated with capital flows, especially in Asia, these developments began to
raise concerns in spite of high reserve levels and current accounts generally
being in surplus. Perhaps reflecting lessons from earlier periods, there was a
significantly greater readiness to allow currencies affected by upward pressures
to appreciate. In this regard, Korea, Thailand and Brazil stand out. Nevertheless,
there was still massive recourse by a few countries to sterilised intervention,
with the global change in reserves in 2006 being twice that of 2005. In addition,
many countries either eased monetary policy, or were loath to tighten it, for
fear of attracting still more capital inflows. In extremis, a number of emerging
market economies turned to administrative measures, either to reduce inflows
and ease the problem of sterilisation, or to encourage capital outflows.
This combination of relatively accommodative monetary policy and a
substantial appetite for portfolio investments – purchases by the private sector
of emerging market securities, and even greater purchases by reserve
managers of bonds issued by the major industrial economies – seems to have
put downward pressure on term premia everywhere. And to this must be
added the influence in the industrial countries of another force. Pension funds
and insurance companies with longer-term liabilities have been purchasing
larger proportions of long bonds to “immunise” themselves against potential
interest rate movements and valuation swings. While it is impossible to
estimate the relative importance of these influences on longer-term risk premia,
they both point in the same downward direction.
Relatively low risk-free rates over the last year or so certainly contributed
to the prevailing view that the world was awash with liquidity – that is, credit
was both cheap and commonly available with weaker conditionality than had
previously been the case. But institutional developments within the financial
sector also contributed to both the perception and the reality of the greater
availability of credit: changes in regulation and technology altered what could
be done, and changes in attitude altered what people wanted to do.
Examples of new practices abound, not least in the area of credit
to households. Mortgage credit has become available on easier terms to
borrowers almost everywhere, thanks both to deregulation in many countries
and to the global extension of the mortgage scoring techniques pioneered in
the United States. Indeed, in the United States and a number of other

8

BIS 77th Annual Report

countries, both mortgage and consumer credit became available to many who
previously would not have had access at all. Until quite late in the period under
review, this was generally considered to be a healthy development supporting
owner-occupied housing. Only in recent months, as noted above, has the
downside to these new practices become more apparent.
Responding to new developments in the financial sector over the course
of the year, supervisory authorities repeatedly urged investment banks to
tighten the credit terms made available to their clients, particularly hedge
funds and private equity firms, and to monitor their counterparty exposures
more vigorously. As the year proceeded, hedge funds themselves became
increasingly involved in the financing of high-risk corporations through the
purchase of collateralised debt obligations, leveraged loans and high-risk
derivative products. And a record level of mergers and acquisitions last year,
driven to an unprecedented degree by private equity firms, ensured a growing
supply of the assets most in demand. One possible motivating force behind
all this activity was a perception that the risks involved had in fact diminished,
given a more benign macroeconomic environment. But a second factor
appears to have been a growing willingness on the part of virtually all
investors, including pension and mutual funds, to take on more risk as a way
of raising returns.
Why this appetite for risk? A first and obvious reason is that relatively low
risk-free rates encouraged such behaviour, particularly on the part of investors
committed for institutional reasons to achieving high rates of return. A second
reason was increased competition among providers of funding. For example,
the rates of return on hedge funds declined last year, and a number of funds
went out of business, compelling those surviving to behave more aggressively.
Indeed, the same factor was even cited in the case of highly profitable banks,
whose competitive behaviour stemmed from concerns that other banks would
be seen to outperform them. Third, and perhaps most important, those
providing credit increasingly follow a business model that involves originating
credit and then transferring the exposure to others via securitisation or
derivatives markets. Clearly, this raises a major principal-agent problem. What
are the implications if originators no longer feel the need for due diligence,
and the ultimate buyers do not have the skills or the information required to
manage the risks inherent in the complex instruments they are buying?
The implications for asset prices last year were more or less the same as
in previous years: that is, they generally moved further upwards, continuing
a trend which had begun around mid-2003 when policy rates in the major
industrial countries were at their lowest. House prices rose significantly in
most countries; global stock markets reached record levels; the spreads on
relatively high-risk instruments, including sovereign debt, stayed at record lows;
and the markets for vintage wine, stamps and fine art rose to unprecedented
levels. In contrast, the price of purchasing access to liquidity, in the form of
options to buy and sell instruments of various sorts, stayed very low.
In spite of this overall positive performance, signs emerged in the course
of the period that a change in the credit cycle might be on the way. The prices
of most financial assets fell back sharply in April and May 2006 before quickly

recovering. There was a further, if smaller, bout of turbulence at the end of
February 2007. While recovery again followed, growing concerns about the
prospects for the US housing market and the broader economy raised
the possibility of future financial implications. Some reflections on what these
and other indicators might portend for the global economy are offered in the
Conclusion of this Annual Report.

Exchange rates, global imbalances and reserve management
Concerns about a disorderly market response to global current account
balances were somewhat alleviated last year by a stabilisation of the US trade
deficit as a percentage of GDP, some rebalancing of global demand growth, a
resumption of the downward trend in the effective value of the US dollar, and
continued low volatility in the major cross rates. Among the other principal
currencies, the further movement in the value of the euro also seemed
supportive of an external rebalancing, even if not wholly welcome for those
directly affected.
Nevertheless, the persistently high level of the US current account deficit,
the growing external debt, and the fact that the real effective value of the dollar
finished the year only 5 percentage points below its 30-year average were less
encouraging. Another counterproductive factor was the continuing effective
depreciation of the yen, in spite of Japan’s large current account surplus and
foreign exchange reserves, which had earlier stabilised around $1 trillion. Other
currencies which either hardly appreciated or even fell on an effective basis
included those of some major oil producers and of China, although the
renminbi did rise at a faster rate against the US dollar. Since these countries
were also registering large and sometimes even growing trade surpluses, this
too was not conducive to a reduction in global trade imbalances.
Another emerging source of concern with respect to the major cross rates
last year was the possibility that major holders of foreign exchange reserves
might change their management policies. As reserves rose still further beyond
levels that might be needed for liquidity purposes, the authorities in a number
of countries announced institutional changes to put more emphasis on
increasing returns, even at the price of accepting more risk. While this could
well affect the price of various asset classes looking forward, in effect extending
the current exuberant phase of the credit cycle, the implications for currency
values are less clear. The reasoning behind this is discussed in the Conclusion.
In the event, the establishment of so-called “wealth funds” by a number
of countries last year was accompanied by reassuring statements that risks
would continue to be carefully managed. Perhaps even more importantly, it
was also suggested that the broader implications for the smooth functioning
of the international financial system would continue to be given serious
consideration by those managing the world’s growing level of foreign
exchange reserves. In the light of history, it is both important and welcome
that creditors and debtors increasingly realise the extent to which their fortunes
are now intertwined.

II. The global economy

Highlights
The strength of the global economy surprised again in 2006 (Graph II.1). This
was due to resilient US consumption in spite of the weakening housing market,
a broad-based upswing in other advanced industrial countries, and continued
rapid growth in emerging market economies. Inflation remained subdued,
with headline inflation receding in the second half of the year. However,
underlying inflation pressures persisted against the backdrop of high, or rising,
rates of resource utilisation in major economies.
The consensus view for 2007 is for a broad-based economic expansion,
easing inflation pressures and gradually receding current account imbalances.
This scenario is supported by growing evidence of a classical recovery in the
euro area and Japan, with exports leading to rising investment, and in turn
to rising employment and consumption. Healthy domestic demand in major
emerging market economies is also encouraging.
Yet the baseline scenario remains subject to significant near-term risks.
The impact of the downturn in the US housing market might not yet have been
fully felt. Admittedly, Europe and Asia appear less dependent on US growth
than a few years ago. Even so, there are questions regarding the strength of
consumption in these regions and advanced industrial countries in general.
At the same time, it is not clear whether inflationary pressures have been
contained. Financing conditions, which have remained supportive to growth,
might also eventually tighten, especially if inflationary risks were perceived
to increase.

Review of the global economy
Overview
In 2006, the global economy again enjoyed a combination of strong growth
and moderate inflation. Total world output expanded at a rate of 51/2%, marking
the fourth consecutive year of growth above 4%. Economic strength was more
broadly based than in the previous years. Virtually all advanced industrial
countries grew at or above trend in 2006, and the major emerging market
economies in Asia and Latin America expanded strongly. Commodity-exporting
countries benefited from an improvement in their terms of trade compared to
2005. Oil prices declined in late 2006, but the prices of many other commodities
rose further (Graph II.2). Despite the robust expansion, however, global
consumer price inflation remained subdued.
The balance of macroeconomic risks shifted in the course of the year. In
the first half of 2006, buoyant growth led to concerns that the global economy
might be approaching a “speed limit”. Oil prices increased by more than 35%
in dollar terms between February and August on the back of persistently
strong demand growth. Moreover, signs that slack was evaporating in major
economies gave rise to concerns about overheating. Long-term inflation
expectations in financial markets rose temporarily in the first half of 2006,
especially in the United States (see Chapter IV), and financial market volatility
increased sharply, if briefly, in May (see Chapter VI).
In the second half of the year, downside risks to economic growth became
more apparent amidst mounting evidence of weakening US growth. At the
same time, concerns about near-term inflation risks eased as oil prices began
to decline. After peaking at more than $75 per barrel in August, spot oil prices
fell by about 25% by the end of 2006. This and the associated fall in petrol
prices supported consumer spending towards the end of the year, especially in
the United States.
The upswing of the past four years has differed in several respects from
that of 1994–97, when the global economy also recorded four consecutive

years of growth at or above trend (Table II.1). First, emerging market
economies, especially in Asia, have contributed 11/4 percentage points more to
global growth than they did a decade ago. To an important extent, this reflects
the buoyancy of the Chinese economy. More generally, however, major
reforms seem to have strengthened growth in many emerging market
economies (see Chapter III). Second, despite relatively moderate rises in real
incomes in the advanced industrial countries, household demand has been a
significantly larger (and corporate spending a smaller) factor behind growth in
advanced economies than in the earlier upturn.
Third, financing conditions have remained much more supportive than a
decade ago. Long-term real interest rates have not risen despite strong global
growth and the progressive removal of monetary accommodation since 2004.
Low interest rates have underpinned valuations of financial and real assets
worldwide (see Chapter VI). In addition, they have been associated with rapid
credit growth and substantial financial deepening (see Chapter VII). As a

BIS 77th Annual Report

13

consequence, credit/GDP ratios have, on aggregate, reached new historical
highs. Finally, structural fiscal deficits have declined during the current
upswing, but to a lesser extent than in the mid-1990s.

A marked shift in global economic activity
The engines driving the global expansion changed in 2006. Output growth in
the United States slowed from an annual rate of more than 4% in the first two
quarters of the year to about 2% in the second half and 11/4% in the first quarter
of 2007. At the same time, demand growth strengthened, or remained firm, in
most other advanced economies, including the euro area, Japan, the United
Kingdom and Canada. Domestic demand growth also continued to play an
important role in major emerging market economies in Asia, central and
eastern Europe and Latin America (see Chapter III).
A sharp downturn in housing market activity was the main factor behind
slower US growth. Housing starts fell by 35% in 2006 and inventories of unsold
houses soared (Graph II.3). Residential investment, which had contributed
about 1/2 percentage point to GDP growth in 2005, on average subtracted more
than 1 percentage point at an annual rate in the second half of 2006.
Nonetheless, the US economy continued to grow at a moderate pace as
consumption appeared to be largely unaffected by the housing slowdown.
The current downturn in the US housing market has been steep, but still
appears shallower than the previous one in the early 1990s. Housing starts
and new home sales have both declined by about 40% to date, compared to
60% and 55% respectively in the previous cycle. Indeed, housing starts and
home sales continued to hover around their long-term average levels in the
first quarter of 2007. Inventories of unsold new homes looked as if they had
peaked, but remained high by historical standards.
Continued increases in household wealth and income limited the impact of
the US housing downturn on consumption. House prices in real terms dropped
in some places that had earlier experienced particularly large rises, but they

did no more than level off nationally. At the same time, the value of US
households’ financial assets continued to grow strongly (see discussion below).
Perhaps even more importantly, unemployment remained low. Even
employment in residential construction, which amounts to about 21/2 % of total
US employment, remained stable. Indeed, it appears remarkably high relative
to the current level of housing starts.
Growth in the euro area exceeded that in the United States in the second
half of last year, for the first time since 2002. The upswing seems to have
followed the classical pattern of rising exports, then resurgent business
investment and employment, and finally, albeit moderately, increased private
consumption. The unemployment rate dropped below the levels seen at the
peak of the previous cycle in 2001. Job creation was especially strong in
Germany, where the unemployment rate fell by almost 11/2 percentage points
in 2006. The recovery of the German economy also supported growth in the
country’s major trading partners in Europe.
The Japanese economy continued to expand at a moderate rate, although
the pattern of demand growth remained somewhat uneven. Corporate
investment continued at a brisk pace, especially in export-oriented sectors,
which were supported by buoyant growth in China and a weak yen (see
Chapter V). Consumption growth remained solid, although it lost momentum
in the second half of 2006, despite cyclically low unemployment.

As a result of these trends, the United States contributed less to the global
economic expansion as 2006 progressed. While aggregate domestic demand
in the G3 economies continued to grow at a rate of about 21/2 %, the United
States accounted for only about 50% of this in the second half of 2006,
compared with an average of 70% over the previous three years (Graph II.4).
The weakening of US domestic demand growth was, however, largely confined

to non-tradable goods: US real imports of goods and services continued to
grow in the second half of the year. Allied with firmer demand elsewhere,
especially from Europe, this helped to sustain strong export growth in the major
emerging market economies. In early 2007, the value of China’s exports to
Europe exceeded that to North America for the first time.
Some developments suggest that the world economy might have become
somewhat less dependent on the US business cycle than it turned out to be
during the last US recession in 2001. In the past few years, industrial
production in major regions has been much less synchronised with the United
States than was the case during the early 2000s. In part, this reflects the fact
that, unlike the current upswing, the earlier cycle was driven by a worldwide
boom and subsequent collapse in IT-related capital goods. This involved a
close co-movement in the production of these goods across regions.
Moreover, the past few years have seen greater regional diversification of
trade linkages. While the openness of economies has generally increased, the
proportion of exports from the major economic regions going to the United
States declined between 2001 and 2006 (with the major exception of China).
Rising emerging economies and growing intraregional trade have reduced this
direct, and possibly also the indirect, export exposure since 2001 (Table II.2).
Much of the change in trade exposures – for instance those of Japan, emerging
Asia and Latin America – has to do with the integration of China into the
global marketplace (see Chapter III).
Another, more recent, indication that dependence on the US business
cycle may have declined is the continued optimism in the corporate sector of
the euro area and other major economies in late 2006 and early 2007. This
decoupling of sentiment bodes well for the near-term outlook, given that
business sentiment tends to be correlated with capital spending.
Yet the likely impact of broader-based or more protracted weakness in the
United States on business confidence among internationally active firms
remains uncertain. For instance, German companies included in the DAX stock
index generate about 70% of their revenues abroad, and the effects of weaker

Yet the linkages

… and financial
markets remain

US growth on their profit expectations and corporate spending might be
considerable. Increasingly global trade linkages, not least through greater
international integration of production processes, underline the potential
importance of such effects.
A closely related reason for caution concerns financial linkages with the
United States. Foreign exposures to a US downturn in the form of holdings of
US assets have surged in the past few years. US external liabilities have risen,
by over $4 trillion between 2001 and 2005. Portfolio debt has increased
especially rapidly, from 28% to about 34% of US external liabilities since 2001.
Moreover, close co-movements of asset prices might spread the impact of a
downturn in US financial markets beyond the holders of US assets. Equity
market returns worldwide are generally highly correlated with those of the
United States. Correlations of US long-term government bond yields with
those in Europe are also high, and have risen during the period of increasing
asset prices and output since mid-2003. International co-movements of asset
prices tend to be even stronger during market downturns.

Improvement in structural fiscal balances
Structural deficits
declined in 2006 …

Fiscal balances in advanced industrial countries finally showed signs of
improvement in 2006. Measures of structural budget deficits, which attempt to
remove cyclical effects from headline deficit figures, decreased in the United
States (by over 1 percentage point of GDP), Germany (by 3/4 percentage point)
and Japan (by 3 3/4 percentage points, largely due to one-off changes in capital
transfers), and increased marginally only in Italy (Table II.3). Changes in US
and German headline balances were even more pronounced, with their deficits
each decreasing by 11/2 percentage points. While in most countries fiscal

outcomes improved due to unusually buoyant tax revenues, in Germany and
Japan expenditure restraint also played an important role.
Recent data suggest that fiscal performance continued to improve in early
2007. The US federal budget deficit is projected to decline to 1.6% of GDP in
fiscal year 2007, about 1 percentage point less than the general government
deficit and the lowest since 2002. In the euro area, most countries under the
excessive deficit procedure are projected to keep or bring down their deficits
below the ceiling of 3% of GDP in 2007, including Italy, where the fiscal deficit is
expected to decline by 2 percentage points. Germany implemented a 3 percentage
point increase in the VAT rate at the start of 2007 with a view to bringing the
headline deficit below 1% of GDP this year. Japan’s draft budget envisages a
reduction in the primary deficit of about 1% of GDP in 2007/08, advancing the
plan to achieve a primary surplus for the government’s budget by 2011/12.
Even so, durable fiscal consolidation remains a distant goal for most
advanced industrial countries. Public debt levels are high in many large
economies, and their reduction is projected to proceed at a snail’s pace over
the medium term. The stubbornly high debt levels in Italy and Japan, despite
low interest rates and, in Japan, above trend growth, are particularly worrying.
Even greater fiscal challenges lie ahead, as the ageing of populations will
affect government budgets and, possibly even more strongly, household
behaviour over the next several decades (discussed below).

Current account positions stabilised, but underlying imbalances persisted
Current account balances broadly stabilised as a percentage of GDP last year.
In particular, the US current account deficit remained at about 61/2 % of GDP
(Table II.4). Lower energy prices towards the end of 2006 were one major
factor behind this: the US oil trade deficit fell by almost $20 billion in the
fourth quarter. For 2006 as a whole, the current account deficit of oil-importing
countries remained unchanged at about 1% of GDP, compared to an increase
of 1/2 % of GDP in 2005. Correspondingly, the surpluses of oil exporters rose
less than in the previous year; the combined current account surpluses of oilexporting countries remained broadly unchanged at 91/4% of GDP, compared
with a jump of almost 3 percentage points in 2005.
Another factor that prevented current account imbalances from rising was
the more balanced global economic expansion. Real exports of goods from the
United States grew by more than 10%, the highest rate since 2000, supported
by stronger growth of its major trading partners. The euro area recorded a small
current account deficit, following an almost balanced current account in 2005
and a moderate surplus in 2004. Emerging Asia (excluding China) and Latin
America recorded small increases in current account surpluses relative to GDP.
Movements in real effective exchange rates in 2006 appear to have been
still too small to lead to any substantial reduction of external imbalances. The
dollar depreciated by 4% in real effective terms, but is still only 5% below its
long-term average (see Chapter V). Correspondingly, the euro appreciated by
about 5%. At the same time, however, the yen depreciated by 61/2 % and
Japan’s current account surplus increased to almost 4% of GDP. In addition, the
exchange rates of many surplus countries in Asia appreciated only moderately

or even depreciated. In particular, China’s currency depreciated by about 1% in
real effective terms. Against this background, China’s current account surplus
rose by 50% (to over 9% of GDP).
Moreover, the major factors behind the domestic saving/investment
imbalances underlying international external payments imbalances seem to be
persisting. Perhaps most importantly, the US household saving rate remained
in negative territory in 2006. The moderate increase in the US national saving
rate was primarily attributable to the lower fiscal deficit. At the same time,
saving rates in emerging Asia stayed at high levels. The national saving rate
in China even seems to have remained at a record level in 2006.
The pattern of global investment remained uneven. Lower residential
investment contributed to a narrowing national savings gap in the United States,
while changing little in other advanced economies. US corporate investment
growth slowed markedly as the year progressed; non-residential fixed investment
actually declined in the fourth quarter of 2006. Corporate investment picked up
in emerging Asia but, as in previous years, this was driven entirely by China,
where investment as a share of GDP reached a new record level. Machinery and
equipment investment elsewhere in the region seemed to remain at a low ebb.

subdued growth of household income. Average annual growth of household
real disposable income was on aggregate somewhat less than 2% in 2003–06,
compared to about 21/2% during the second half of the 1990s and about 3%
from 1975 to 1990. In contrast, consumption grew at an average annual rate
of about 21/2% from 2003 to 2006. As a consequence, consumption as a share
of disposable income, which had been on an upward trend in many advanced
economies since the early 1990s, reached new records in the period under
review (Graph II.5).
The rise in the propensity to consume, and the corresponding decline in
household saving rates, has been broad-based in the past four years. It has
included in particular the United States, but has also been evident in other
countries such as Japan, the United Kingdom, France and Spain. In some
countries, most notably the United States, consumption has exceeded
disposable income in the past few years, implying negative household saving
rates. One major exception to this picture has been Germany, where the
propensity to consume has actually declined since the early 2000s.
Several developments seem to have supported strong household
spending in the face of recent subdued income growth. First, the value of
household assets has risen rapidly. Second, in a related vein, rising collateral
values and the financial innovations of the past decade have reduced the credit
constraints on households. Moreover, low interest rates have helped contain
debt service burdens. Growing household balance sheets seem to have
supported consumption despite large hidden fiscal liabilities.

Changes in household wealth and borrowing
Household assets have experienced a rapid and broad-based increase in value
during the current upswing in most advanced economies. Since end-2002, the
ratio of total assets to disposable income has grown by about 15–20% in the
United States, the euro area and the United Kingdom (Graph II.6). This increment
is roughly equal in magnitude to annual disposable income, and brought the

asset/income ratios in these economies to record highs. One major exception
to this picture is Japan, where the asset/income ratio has barely changed
during the past 15 years or so.
Financial assets have accounted for most of the increase in the United
States (60%) and the United Kingdom (55%). Within this, the bulk of the growth
in financial assets – three quarters in the United States – has come from
capital gains, mainly in equities and the pension and mutual funds that hold
them. Net purchases of financial assets account for the small remainder. In
Japan, rising values of financial assets and falling property values have largely
offset each other.
Increases in the value of non-financial assets have generally also been
considerable. In the euro area, where the share of financial assets is relatively
smaller, increases in the value of houses and durable goods even dominated.
House prices have risen rapidly in most advanced economies in the past few
years (Table II.5). This, rather than accumulation of additional housing or
consumer durables, has accounted for the lion’s share of the growth in nonfinancial assets. For instance, in the United States, net accumulation of
physical assets (including housing) has made up only around 40% of the
measured rise in household non-financial assets since end-2002.
Along with rising asset values, household credit has expanded briskly in
many advanced industrial countries. This has been particularly marked in
countries with booming housing markets, including the United States, the

Table II.5

United Kingdom, France, Spain and several smaller advanced economies.
Correspondingly, the stock of mortgage debt has risen considerably in these
countries (Table II.5).
As both sides of the household sector’s balance sheet have expanded,
overall leverage – the ratio of debt to assets – has changed much less. In the
euro area, debt has increased broadly in tandem with asset values (Graph II.6).
In the United States and the United Kingdom, however, debt has risen even
faster than asset values. By contrast, in Japan both debt and assets have
trended down slightly relative to disposable income over the past decade as
property prices have fallen until recently.
The expansion of household debt has generally been supported by low
retail interest rates. From 2003 to 2006, typical mortgage rates in the countries
shown in Graph II.6 were on average around 3 percentage points lower than
in the 1990s. Retail interest rates seem to be reflecting the low level of interest
rates worldwide and increased credit supply. Relaxation of lending standards
due to greater competition and greater reliance on securitisation has contributed
to a significant increase in lending, including to riskier households.

… but leverage has

Household financial deepening and consumption
These developments might have supported consumption growth through a
variety of closely related mechanisms. First, households simply seem to have
consumed more out of current income in the face of rising asset values. While
it is difficult to isolate this channel from others, empirical studies generally
find a significant impact of wealth on consumption. For instance, simple

22

values …

consumption functions for the United States yield estimated contributions
of higher asset values to consumption that even exceed those of growth of
disposable income in the period 2003–06. Wealth effects in other economies
seem to have been smaller, but still significant.
Second, rising asset values have increased households’ scope for
borrowing. In particular, housing equity withdrawal in the form of borrowing
against rising collateral values has been an important source of cash flow,
especially in English-speaking countries. For instance, in the United States
flow of funds data suggest that housing equity withdrawal was, on average,
equivalent to 41/2 % of household disposable income from 2003 to 2005, and
11/2 % in 2006. At the same time, its direct effect on consumption is likely to have
been smaller than these figures suggest. Surveys conducted in Australia and
the United States show that only about one fifth of the equity extracted from
housing was spent on consumption.
Third, low retail interest rates have allowed households to increase their
average debt outstanding without a similar increase in repayment burdens.
Total interest payments as a share of disposable income have drifted down in
the euro area and, until recently, risen moderately in the United States and the
United Kingdom. Debt service also seems to have remained fairly contained
in the other advanced economies, although there have been exceptions, such
as Australia.
The subdued profile of interest payment ratios also partly reflects the
substitution of lower-cost housing-related debt for consumer debt. As well as
helping to limit overall interest payments, this has lengthened the average
duration of household debt. In addition, at least in the United States, some of
the increase in mortgage debt service has replaced payment obligations such
as rent, as more marginal borrowers have become homeowners. Broader
measures of household financial obligations have therefore not risen as quickly
as mortgage debt interest.
In addition to supporting faster consumption growth, these developments
seem to have helped households smooth spending better than in the past.
The past 10 years have seen the variation of aggregate household income
growth remain at levels similar to the previous decade (Table II.6). At the

same time, however, consumption growth has generally fluctuated much
less, with the notable exceptions of Germany and Japan, where household
balance sheet expansion has been relatively limited. Empirical estimates also
show a decline in the income elasticity of US consumption in the past couple
of years. These observations are consistent with financial deepening reducing
liquidity constraints of households.

How resilient are household balance sheets?
It is not clear how durable the increase in asset valuations underpinning the
expansion of household balance sheets is. Over the past 10 years, there has
not been a serious test of the resilience of balance sheets in the form of a
sharp and simultaneous decline of asset values in the larger economies. The
financial shocks that have occurred have generally only affected one asset
class at a time. The drop in equity prices worldwide from 2000 to 2002
coincided with a fairly fast-paced rise in house prices in most advanced
industrial countries (with the exception of Germany, Japan and Switzerland). In
later years, housing prices declined temporarily in several smaller economies,
but they are still rising fairly rapidly in nominal terms in many others.
The experience of countries where house prices have fallen in recent
years suggests that shocks specific to this asset class can be relatively
easily absorbed as long as other factors affecting the balance sheet are
supportive. Provided macroeconomic and labour market conditions continue
to be strong, a moderate reversal in house prices is likely to result in some
pullback in consumption, but probably not enough to generate a significant
macroeconomic slowdown. However, a more generalised fall in asset prices that
coincided with a macroeconomic downturn – as, for instance, happened in the
Nordic countries in the early 1990s and the Netherlands more recently – might
have more serious implications for consumption. Because sharp equity price falls
often occur in the lead-up to recessions, they are also seen to precede larger
consumption declines more often than falls in house prices alone (Graph II.7).
Another reason for expecting a more benign outcome from isolated
declines in house prices can be found in distributional considerations. In most
countries that have experienced rapid growth in housing-related debt, the
increases have been concentrated amongst mid-career and higher-income
households, especially existing homeowners. These groups generally already
have substantial financial and other resources, and might be less likely than
average workers to lose their jobs in a downturn. They are therefore the most
able to bear the risks of additional debt.
One exception to this pattern might be the United States. Although
relaxations of lending standards to households have been a feature of the
current cycle in many countries, the substantial expansion of the market to
higher-risk borrowers seems to have been particular to the United States.
Subprime mortgage lending accounts for a larger share of new mortgage
lending in the United States than in other major economies, and has been
increasing as a share of the total mortgage market there.
Many of the subprime and other non-traditional loan contracts
incorporated large projected increases in required repayments several years

into their terms, even if market rates did not rise. This has generated payment
shocks for those borrowers who could not refinance or sell for a profit as
planned when the interest payment was reset. The result has been a sharp
pickup in mortgage delinquencies and defaults in the United States since late
2006. Although this has been most evident for subprime mortgages,
delinquencies have also risen noticeably for prime and near prime loans with
variable interest rates and resetting payments.

The role of hidden fiscal liabilities
Growing welfare
payments …

… and lower taxes

Hidden fiscal
liabilities …

Despite a growing awareness of hidden fiscal liabilities, government welfare
programmes and tax policies seem to have provided few incentives for
households to increase saving. Since 1990, the share of government welfare
payments in total household income has increased slightly in nearly all major
industrial countries. This trend has been most apparent in those countries
where population ageing is already boosting the size of the retired population,
such as Italy and Japan. The share of social welfare payments in income is
now slightly higher than at comparable points of earlier cycles in several
countries, including the United States.
Household income has benefited not only from higher welfare payments
but also from falling taxes. Relative to compensation of employees, personal
income and wealth taxes paid declined in the late 1990s. Although this ratio
has begun to pick up in some countries more recently, both as the expansion
matures and as capital gains are realised and taxed, it generally remains lower
than at the start of the decade.
The fiscal liabilities associated with the ageing of the population raise
serious doubts as to whether these two trends can continue. Within the next
10–15 years a dwindling share of workers will have to start supporting a
ballooning share of dependants in all major industrial countries. In order to
maintain current levels of pension, health care and other welfare benefits,

total age-related spending would need to increase significantly over the next
four decades (Table II.7). Clearly, taxes would have to be raised substantially
to finance this spending increase. Alternatively, if the additional spending
were to be debt-financed, then government debt ratios could spiral well above
current ceilings, such as the euro area’s 60% of GDP.
Empirical studies indicate that household consumption and saving might
be quite sensitive to changes in the state of public finances, especially if
the level of public debt is already high. One example might be the weak
consumption observed in Germany since the start of this decade. This has
been partly attributed to households’ worries about their future pension and
health care benefits. The timing of the “wake-up call” for households will
depend on many factors, including their current level of saving. But probably
the most important considerations will be the timing and nature of reforms to
public pension and health care systems.

… might at some

household saving

Prospects for changes in household consumption and saving
The current configuration of record high propensities to consume and
correspondingly low household saving rates in many advanced industrial
countries appears unusual. Its sustainability ultimately depends on whether
expectations of future permanent income underlying current spending
decisions will be validated. A number of factors, including strong global
growth, rising employment in many economies and still low interest rates,
seem supportive to favourable income expectations and asset valuations in
the near term. At the same time, the expansion of household balance sheets
raises important longer-term issues, some of which could also be relevant
over shorter horizons.
A first issue is whether rises in asset prices genuinely imply increases in
the household sector’s wealth. Increases in the value of equity holdings
represent greater aggregate wealth to the extent that they reflect correct
expectations of future output growth. This could include participation in
productivity gains in rapidly growing emerging economies by households
in advanced economies, via international portfolio diversification.
In the case of residential property, rising prices of a given stock of houses
imply a redistribution of wealth, from current and future users of housing

services to existing house owners, rather than a net increase in wealth for the
household sector as a whole. The current higher consumption levels resulting
from this redistribution might in future be offset by higher saving on the part of
future users of housing services. However, the consumption responses of this
latter group could well be some way off.
A second issue concerns the impact of higher leverage on household
spending. It is not clear whether the apparent boost to consumption from
households’ borrowing behaviour will persist. On the one hand, increased
capacity of households to borrow against rising asset values, and enhanced
credit supply to households more generally, might support consumption
growth for a while, especially in an environment of ongoing financial innovation
and heightened competition in the financial sector.
On the other hand, rising debt levels might have increased the sensitivity
of household balance sheets to financial and macroeconomic shocks. At the
aggregate level, debt/asset ratios still appear relatively low, notwithstanding the
increase during the past couple of years in the English-speaking countries. One
key question is what would happen if long-term interest rates were to rise from
the current historically low levels (see Chapter VI). Much would arguably
depend on the factors behind such a rise. If it reflected expectations of stronger
growth, equity prices might also rise because of improved profit expectations.
In contrast, higher interest rates due to increasing risk premia or higher
inflation would probably bring down the net present value of asset classes
across the board. This could also reduce the capacity of households to manage
financial risks and smooth consumption over time.
Finally, as mentioned above, hidden fiscal liabilities pose a hard to
quantify risk for the sustainability of strong household spending. While the
drawn-out nature of demographic trends and the political economy of major
welfare reforms suggest that shifts in household saving and consumption
behaviour are not likely to be abrupt, surprises along the path towards less
generous but more sustainable welfare systems cannot be excluded. Financial
problems surrounding unfunded pension schemes or public health care
systems could affect households’ expectations and increase their propensity to
save in a relatively short period of time.

Inflation developments

Global headline inflation closely tracked movements in energy prices in the
period under review. On the back of rising oil prices, global headline consumer
price inflation rose above 3% in the first half of 2006 before dropping sharply
as energy prices declined towards the end of the year (Graph II.8). In the
second quarter of 2006, headline CPI inflation in the United States exceeded
4%, the highest reading since the early 1990s, before falling back to 2%
towards the end of the year. Energy prices also raised headline inflation in
the euro area to 21/2 % before it receded to a level below 2% by end-2006. The
decline in energy prices caused Japan’s headline inflation to dip into negative

territory at the beginning of 2007. Emerging market economies experienced
similar fluctuations in annual changes in headline CPI, although the impact of
oil price movements was still dampened by administrative measures in some
Asian economies (see Chapter III).
In the second half of 2006, the restraining effect of lower energy prices
was partly offset by accelerating food price inflation. This was especially visible
in emerging market economies, where food typically accounts for more than
30% of the consumption basket, compared to about 15% in advanced industrial
countries. Food prices increased by about 7% in emerging market economies,
primarily due to a drop in supply. For instance, despite easing in early 2007,
wheat prices remained about 25% higher in dollar terms than one year
previously because drought reduced the crop in major producer countries
such as Australia.
To some extent, however, the increase in food prices might herald another
more secular change in relative prices, similar to the observed rise in the prices
of oil and base metal commodities vis-à-vis manufactured consumption goods.
Prices of maize and soybeans have risen sharply because of strong demand
growth. One important factor behind this development seems to be policies
aiming at reducing oil dependence through the production of biofuel. Another
factor which could gain importance over time is that rising income in emerging
economies is lifting demand for high-quality food that is relatively scarce
(such as fish) or whose production requires high feed input (such as meat).
Inflation excluding food and energy seems to have gradually trended
higher over 2006. While this seems consistent with the notion that the passthrough of commodity price increases to the prices of other products
remained fairly limited, it might indicate that underlying inflationary pressures
have risen. In the United States and the euro area, core inflation accelerated
in the course of 2006 and remained elevated into 2007. While some of this
apparently reflected one-off factors – such as the VAT increase in Germany –
there were no clear signs of a reversal in either economy. Core inflation in
Japan remained negative, despite a modest upward trend since mid-2006.

The fourth year of strong economic growth went hand in hand with a further
rise in resource utilisation worldwide. Traditional indicators such as output and
unemployment gaps suggest that economic slack has more or less been used
up in the major advanced economies (Graph II.9). Slack is also thought to be
disappearing in emerging market economies, with unemployment rates
reaching multi-year lows in many cases.
There are some indications that vanishing slack might have increased
inflationary risks. In the United States, various measures of labour
compensation displayed signs of acceleration against the backdrop of tight
labour market conditions. In cyclically less advanced economies like Germany
and Japan, labour unions appear to have become more aggressive in
demanding pay rises. Actual wage increases in the euro area, however,
remained subdued. Similarly, the growth rate of wages in Japan was still
negative in spite of falling unemployment.
Diminishing slack in labour markets was also associated with an increase
in the wage share of total income in some cyclically advanced economies such
as the United States and the United Kingdom, against the long-term downward
trend. Some researchers argue that compensation as a share of GDP can be
seen as a proxy for the real marginal cost of production, which is held to be an
important determinant of inflation. Indeed, together with the wedge between
relatively low import and higher domestic prices, the falling wage share can
explain a significant part of the disinflation experienced during recent decades
(Table II.8).
Yet it appears difficult to draw any firm conclusions about how these
developments affect the inflation outlook. First, measuring levels of resource
utilisation is fraught with difficulties, even in advanced economies with
relatively well developed statistics. Assessing economic slack in emerging
economies is even more challenging, and this makes it difficult to quantify
reliably the amount of slack at the global level. There is also considerable
uncertainty about the level of the unemployment rate below which inflation

might be expected to accelerate. Empirical studies suggest that the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU) in the United States has
declined by 1 percentage point or more since the mid-1980s, owing to various
institutional changes in the US labour market. Estimates of the NAIRU for
the euro area have also been lowered by a similar amount in the past couple
of years.
Second, productivity growth is difficult to assess. It tends to vary over time
and there is a particularly high degree of uncertainty about the interpretation of
the most recent observations, which are often subject to substantial revisions.
For instance, the final revision to estimates of labour productivity growth in the
United States since 2000 has amounted to about 1 percentage point per year.
This is almost half of the total average rate. Moreover, it is always hard to
assess to what extent the most recent changes in productivity growth reflect
structural as opposed to cyclical factors.
Third, and in a related vein, the future evolution of marginal costs of
production appears uncertain. Wage shares in advanced economies have
fallen by about 4 percentage points since the early 1980s. This downward trend
observed across industrial countries cannot be explained by cyclical factors.
Recent empirical studies support the view that technological progress
and globalisation could have contributed to structurally lower wage shares
in advanced industrial countries, possibly by curtailing the bargaining power
of workers.
Finally, there is considerable uncertainty about possible changes in the
inflation process in general. For instance, the sensitivity of inflation to domestic
slack – measured by either the output gap or the unemployment gap – is
reported to have declined across a wide range of countries in the past two
decades. Yet it is not clear how much guidance this observation provides under
changing macroeconomic conditions. One interpretation is that Phillips curves
have flattened and that unemployment might have to rise more than in the past

to reduce inflation. Another possibility is that these estimates might unduly (and
spuriously) reflect recent periods of high growth which failed to ignite higher
inflation. If the reason were unaccounted-for positive supply shocks which
were expected to continue, this would make inflation control easier, not harder.
Against this general backdrop, it is difficult to assess to what extent firms
might pass on higher labour costs to their output prices. High corporate profits
suggest that firms have scope to absorb rising labour costs by margin
compression. This seems to have happened during the cyclical run-ups in
wage shares in the early 1990s and around 2000, as a result of which inflation
remained low and stable. However, a steadily rising number of surveyed firms
in the euro area and the United Kingdom expect to increase output prices. This
might be an indication of an increasing capacity to pass on rising costs to
consumers in an environment of strong demand growth.
Stubbornly low inflation in Japan could be seen as an example of how
the combination of structural and cyclical factors complicates the assessment
of the inflation outlook and the associated risks. Service prices have barely
changed since 1999 – compared to annual service price inflation of 11/2–41/2%
in the United States and the euro area. This appears closely related to weak
wage developments, which have supported high profits and corporate debt
reduction at stable prices. In addition, deregulation has had non-negligible
effects in markets for specific goods (eg mobile telephone charges) and in
labour markets. Lower prices for both imports and import-competing goods
have also been significant. More generally, notwithstanding inflation remaining
close to zero, economic growth and restored financial stability imply that the
potential for a downward deflationary spiral in Japan is much smaller than
might have been the case five years ago.

… but might create

The relative stability of long-run inflation expectations might indicate that
economic agents view current uncertainties as unlikely to jeopardise price
stability. While survey measures of the short-term inflation expectations of the
household sector have fluctuated with energy price developments, those of
long-term inflation expectations have remained remarkably stable in recent
years. In the United States, 10-year-ahead expectations for CPI inflation, taken
from the Survey of Professional Forecasters, have remained virtually constant
at 21/2 % since 1998. In the euro area, five-year-ahead inflation expectations
based on a similar survey have also remained very stable at 1.9% during the
last few years (Graph II.10). A high degree of stability is also found in marketbased measures of inflation expectations, such as break-even inflation rates
derived from long-term index-linked bonds.
However, the reliability of inflation expectations indicators is sometimes
challenged. One line of criticism is related to the quality of surveys, or the
existence of time-varying risk premia and insufficient market liquidity that
limit the information content of market-based indicators. Another, more
fundamental, criticism concerns the limited understanding of the process of
expectations formation. The fact that long-term inflation expectations have
apparently remained well anchored over the past few years might not provide

an indication as to whether, and if so how strongly, these expectations might
eventually be revised. For instance, if expectations are based on past experience,
as argued by some observers, they might still rise quickly if trend inflation
changed appreciably or inflation rates exceeded a certain threshold.

Outlook: a welcome moderation of growth and inflation?
The consensus view for the current year is for a moderation of global output
growth to a sustainable level. The broad-based economic expansion is forecast
to continue in 2007, and into 2008, at a slightly slower pace than in 2006
(Table II.9). Inflation is expected to ease as growth moderates and oil prices
stabilise. A further narrowing of growth differentials is also expected to
contribute to gradually receding current account imbalances.
In many respects, the macroeconomic environment appears favourable.
Financing conditions remain generally supportive to growth. Unemployment
has fallen in major advanced and emerging economies. Perhaps more
fundamentally, the seemingly smooth shift in the balance of growth across
regions during the past few quarters might support the view that the global
economy has become more flexible and resilient.
Nonetheless, the baseline scenario is subject to significant near-term
risks. The full impact of the US housing market downturn might not yet have
been felt. The recent difficulties in the subprime mortgage market could well
deepen the housing market downturn through forced sales of homes and
adverse effects on credit supply. While Europe and Asia appear somewhat less
dependent on US growth than a few years ago, questions persist about the
robustness of consumption growth in some large economies. Moreover,
the exposures to contagion associated with rapidly evolving global trade and

financial linkages are not well understood. Finally, and in a related vein, an
economic downturn might give rise to protectionism.
The inflation outlook also remains uncertain. Energy and other commodity
prices have rebounded since the beginning of 2007. Moreover, underlying
inflationary pressures are still visible in major economies, and it is not clear
whether the projected moderation of growth would be sufficient to significantly
reduce resource pressures. At the same time, capacity utilisation rates also
seem to be rising in major emerging economies. Assessing the impact of rising
wages on inflation might be a particular challenge for central banks in
advanced industrial economies, especially after such a long period of subdued
wage growth.
Macroeconomic outcomes might also depend on how financial markets
adjust to news. A deeper than expected US slowdown, and concerns about
the sustainability of strong growth elsewhere, could lead to rising risk premia.
Equally, any perception that inflation risks are not under control could also
lead to a repricing of risks. The two episodes of heightened financial market
volatility in May–June 2006 and February 2007 are a reminder that negative
surprises with respect to both inflation and growth can unsettle markets. While
on those occasions there was no pass-through to the real economy, such an
impact cannot be ruled out in the future.

III. Emerging market economies

Highlights
Emerging market economies (EMEs) continued to record strong growth,
moderate inflation and current account surpluses in 2006 and into the first
quarter of 2007. Yet inflation pressures raised concerns in some countries, in
part because of robust demand and in part due to uncertainties about the price
of commodities. Despite moderate monetary tightening, credit growth has
remained significant in a number of EMEs. At the same time, fiscal consolidation
and improved debt management have enhanced economies’ resilience.
Following a brief overview of recent developments and a discussion of
inflation risks and fiscal developments, this chapter addresses two important
topics. First, it explores the implications of a balance of payments shift towards
large current account surpluses that exceed net capital inflows. Foreign
investors’ influence on domestic asset markets could be larger than implied by
net capital flows, in part because these investors have boosted their holdings
of emerging market assets. Furthermore, position-taking in emerging market
assets via derivatives transactions might not be fully recorded. Asset prices in
EMEs have surged, but it is not yet clear whether foreign influences have
added to asset price volatility.
A second topic is the emergence of China in world trade. China’s role at
the centre of an integrated production network in East Asia has altered trading
patterns. A significant amount of China’s imports are intermediate goods to be
processed by its export sector; imports of final goods for domestic demand are
much smaller. Commodity exporters have tended to benefit from increased
demand from China. However, the gains to its neighbours and other emerging
market trading partners are not as clear-cut; some countries have lost market
share to China in third markets but have been able to expand their exports of
intermediate and capital goods to the country for use in its export sector. A rise
in the relatively low level of China’s demand for imports to satisfy domestic final
demand would provide further opportunities to its trading partners, and would
also increase the extent to which Chinese growth could offset any potential
slowdown in US demand. Finally, China’s emergence also has mixed
implications for the exchange rate policies of its neighbours.

Economic developments
Growth in EMEs continued to surprise on the upside, rising to 7.4% in 2006
from 6.8% in 2003–05 (Table III.1), and remained strong in the first quarter
of 2007. The latest consensus forecast is for growth to slow moderately in
2007 compared to 2006. A limited slowdown is also expected in some of the
fastest-growing economies (eg China, India and Argentina). In Brazil, where
persistently slow growth has been a medium-term concern, growth picked up

last year to exceed its 2003–05 average, and is expected to rise further in 2007.
Recent revisions to the national accounts revealed a larger contribution by the
services sector, and consequently faster growth than previously estimated.
Current account surpluses increased in Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Middle
East and Russia. In contrast, current account deficits grew in India, Turkey and
South Africa, and remained large in central Europe.
Turning to the components of aggregate demand, net exports continued
to make positive contributions to growth in China and the rest of Asia. On the
other hand, their contribution has fallen (although it remains positive) in central
Europe and has been slightly negative in Latin America over the past two
years. As in previous years, domestic demand once again played a key role in
supporting growth. Consumption demand was important in most emerging
market regions, while investment spending also drove growth in central
Europe, China and Latin America.

Median inflation in EMEs rose to 3.7% in 2006, up from 3.5% in 2005, and
thus remained close to the median for the period 1999–2005. There was,
however, significant regional variation. In Asia, median inflation was still well
below that in other regions in 2006, but was clearly up from the near zero rates
observed in 2002. It also picked up sharply in other EMEs, although it has
tended to fall in Latin America. While inflation trends are hard to read, as
discussed below, there are some significant upside inflation risks.

… and somewhat
higher inflation

Outlook and policy challenges
There are two broad risks to the outlook for EMEs. One is that a marked
slowdown in the US economy could significantly reduce growth. However, the
present discussion will not focus on this risk except to note that the outlook is
mixed. On the one hand, as discussed in Chapter II, the risk of a US slowdown
cannot be entirely discounted, because the full effects of weakness in US
housing markets remain unclear. On the other hand, consensus forecasts are
for continued moderate growth in the United States in 2007. Furthermore, the
risks to EMEs would be mitigated if other economies, including China, Japan
and the European Union, were able to offset any slowdown in US demand with
increases in their own domestic demand.
The focus of this section is rather on another risk, that of higher inflation.
During the past year, concerns were expressed in a number of instances
about elevated or rising inflation. In some countries (eg Argentina, Russia and
Venezuela), the issue was the level of inflation. In other cases (including
Mexico), inflation above the target range was the main concern. Finally,
rising inflation was an issue in a number of countries. For example, in India,
after falling in 2005 inflation rose significantly in 2006 (and now exceeds
the Reserve Bank’s medium-term comfort zone), and there were concerns
about further increases in 2007. In China, headline inflation, which is low
compared to other countries, has recently also picked up noticeably.
Moreover, there is some uncertainty as to whether available measures of
inflation in China accurately reflect underlying inflationary pressures. In
contrast, inflation performance has improved in a number of cases, notably in
Brazil, Indonesia, the Philippines and also in Thailand, where inflation last year
was an important concern. Inflation has also fallen in Russia, although it
remains high.
How likely is it that inflation pressures will persist or even intensify in
some countries? Output gaps, relative price changes and inflation expectations
could all play a role.
Output gaps. Some recent estimates suggest that output gaps in EMEs
have nearly closed or are positive. For example, in Brazil, which has recently
experienced disinflation, capacity utilisation rates in manufacturing have been
comparatively high, in the neighbourhood of 82%. In India, capacity utilisation
is reportedly close to 100%. Moreover, in several countries, growth appears to
be above potential. In part, the strong demand reflects positive terms-of-trade
shocks (among commodity exporters) and favourable global conditions. In
this setting, relatively easy monetary policies (see below) could raise the risks
of future inflation in a number of EMEs.

prices

Oil sector
investment has
lagged

Relative price changes. Oil and non-oil commodity prices have risen
sharply in the last few years (Graph III.1). The oil sector illustrates some of the
issues and potential inflation risks. While oil prices had fallen from their peaks
($77 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate) of mid-July 2006, they have
rebounded since January 2007 (to reach $63 per barrel by mid-May). Although
the growth in global demand for oil slowed from about 4% in 2004 to about 1%
in 2006, the recent rebound in prices has partly reflected strong demand
from non-OECD economies. More recently, and looking forward, supply side
issues assume greater importance. For example, OPEC’s decision to cut back
production starting in November 2006 appears to have contributed to the
recent buoyancy of oil prices.
The impact of oil price increases could be significant; a recent analysis
estimates that a supply-induced doubling of prices would boost inflation in
emerging Asia by as much as 1.4 percentage points above baseline. The
inflation effects would be larger if oil importers had difficulty financing the
resulting current account deficits, and also if subsidies that have hitherto
limited energy price increases were assumed to be further reduced or
eliminated. Subsidies have already been cut back to varying degrees in a
number of Asian countries (eg India, Indonesia and Thailand).
Over the medium term, oil reserves are expected to be adequate to meet
the strong demand anticipated from EMEs, as long as major producers
maintain sufficient investment. However, investment to date has not eased
production capacity constraints in some countries. This has added to
concerns that non-OPEC oil production could soon peak, which would
concentrate production in fewer countries. In the meantime, the short-run
risks of sharp increases in oil prices remain substantial. OPEC spare
capacity falls to low levels from time to time, and sudden shocks to supply
or demand have therefore tended to have a large – and at times persistent –
impact on prices.

Over the past year, such shocks have included disruptions to Nigerian oil
production and to US refinery capacity and the onset of unusually cold weather
in the United States in February 2007, which significantly depleted US
inventories. Continuing geopolitical risks, involving oil producers such as Iran
and Iraq, accentuate the risk of price volatility.
Two additional points can be made regarding commodity prices.
First, because of long lead times in building mining capacity, supply
constraints in the metals sector will continue in the face of strong demand
from China and other EMEs. Second, in a number of countries, such as
China, Mexico and South Africa, higher agricultural goods prices have also
played an important role in raising headline inflation. Such price increases
have shown a certain degree of persistence, and there is particular
concern in some of these countries that they could influence inflation
expectations.
Inflation expectations. Using consensus forecasts as a proxy for
expectations, Graph III.2 illustrates that Asian inflation in 2007 is expected to
stay at less than 3%, still relatively low. Moreover, forecasts of inflation have
recently been stable in Asia. In contrast, inflation forecasts have risen
significantly in other emerging markets after an extended period of decline,
while in Latin America forecasts have fallen in recent years.

Inflation forecasts
point to a mixed
picture …

… but expectations
could influence
wage setting

Expectations could
change suddenly

One reason why inflation expectations are relevant is that they can lead to
higher wage demands. It is generally believed that wage increases have been
dampened due to large additions to the global labour force resulting from the
growing integration of China and, increasingly, India into the global economy.
This effect could be reinforced in countries with large supplies of labour from
their own rural sectors. However, recent analysis finds that, while the wages
of unskilled workers have indeed not risen in some major EMEs (Brazil, China
and India), wages of skilled or non-production workers (white-collar and other
workers involved in supervision or services often perceived as requiring more
skills) have increased rapidly. For example, since the beginning of this decade,
real manufacturing wages have grown at a compound annual rate of over 11%
in China and Russia. Real wages of non-production workers also rose in India
earlier this decade (by about 3.8% a year). The possibility that higher inflation
expectations could feed into wage demands has been a particular concern in
countries where food prices have risen significantly.
Could inflation expectations shift suddenly? An important lesson from the
May–June 2006 episode of market volatility (see Chapter VI) and from recent
run-ups in agricultural prices is that both inflation and inflation forecasts can
suddenly spike upwards and breach targets; Turkey and Mexico are cases in
point. In Turkey, market volatility in May–June 2006 triggered a sharp
depreciation that is estimated to have added 3.5 percentage points to actual
inflation and caused private sector forecasts to jump for both 2006 (to 10%
from just over 7%) and 2007 (to 7.8% from 5.6%). In the case of Mexico,
inflation at the end of 2006 unexpectedly breached the 4% ceiling of the
inflation target (3% ±1%), in part because of a sharp increase in the price of
maize. Global maize prices in US dollars rose 58% between July 2006 and
April 2007, in part due to maize being diverted to the production of ethanol, a
biofuel. Subsequently, inflation and inflation forecasts for Mexico remained
close to or above the target ceiling.
To sum up, notwithstanding generally moderate inflation in EMEs at this
time, there appear to be a number of risks. Capacity constraints are potentially
an issue in a number of countries, and sharp increases in commodity prices are
possible. Accordingly, sudden upward revisions in inflation and inflation
expectations cannot be ruled out.

Monetary policy
Moderate monetary
tightening …

Against this backdrop, monetary policy has tended to tighten since 2004.
However, there has been considerable cross-country variation, and in some
EMEs the pace of tightening has slowed since the second half of 2006
(Graph III.3). A steady raising of policy rates has been observed in India
(175 basis points since December 2004) and in China (81 basis points),
supplemented by other tightening measures (see below). In other Asian
countries, however, since around mid-2006 policy rates have either stopped
increasing or fallen. In some cases, notably Indonesia, the Philippines and
Thailand, this was in response to emerging signs of disinflation. Similar mixed
policy outcomes are apparent in Latin America and other EMEs. Disinflation
has led to falling rates in Brazil and, for a time, in Mexico. In contrast, three

countries with current account deficits that experienced depreciation pressures
during the May–June 2006 episode of market volatility had to raise interest
rates significantly: Turkey by 425 basis points, and Hungary and South Africa
by 200 basis points each. In the case of Hungary, however, the interest rate
rise also reflected concerns about fiscal deficits.
The implications of these policy actions for some common measures of
monetary conditions have varied (Graph III.3, centre and right-hand panels).
Real policy rates began to rise in China and other emerging markets a few
years ago. Median real policy rates have converged to over 2% in other Asian
EMEs and Latin America, and over 3% in China and other emerging markets.
It should be noted that, in China, the real interest rate would be negative if an
interbank rate rather than the bank lending rate were used as the proxy for
monetary conditions. These real interest rates are much lower than the brisk
rates of potential growth in many EMEs, suggesting that underlying monetary
conditions have remained relatively expansionary.
Rapid real private credit growth in a number of EMEs reinforces the
impression of easy monetary conditions (Graph III.4). Since the end of 2003,
when distinct increases in real private credit became apparent in all regions,
the compound annual rate of growth in bank credit to the private sector has
been nearly 9% in China, 5% in other Asian EMEs, 15% in Latin America and
21% in other emerging markets. The fastest rates of credit growth have been
observed in Venezuela (47%) and in India, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey (in
ascending order, ranging from 21 to 31%). In some central and eastern
European countries, rapid credit growth raises special concerns because
household borrowing is in large part denominated in foreign currency.
Credit growth reflects both structural and short-run factors. Among the
structural factors, financial deepening appears to be particularly important.
Indeed, the more rapid rates of real private credit growth have been observed
in countries with lower credit/GDP ratios (Graph III.4, right-hand panel). In

Appreciation
restrains demand …

… but results in
heavy intervention

Graph III.4

some regions, such as central Europe, increased competition in banking and
financial integration have also played major roles in boosting credit growth.
Short-run factors include strong economic performance and, as discussed
below, efforts to contain appreciation pressures.
While policy rates and credit growth indicate relatively easy monetary
conditions, significant real exchange rate appreciation in some countries
suggests some complementary restraining of demand. Between December
2004 and March 2007, real appreciation was over 10% in Korea, Malaysia and
Thailand and exceeded 20% in Indonesia. Outside Asia, cumulative real
exchange rate appreciation over the same period reached 34% in Brazil. By
contributing to disinflation and lowering aggregate demand, real exchange rate
appreciation may have provided scope for a number of countries to lower policy
rates or take other easing measures. In some countries these pressures appear
to have been such as to induce the authorities to reduce interest rates to stem
“unwanted” capital inflows.
While contributing to disinflation, however, appreciation pressures have
raised concerns for at least three reasons. One is their adverse impact on
competitiveness and the tradable goods sector. Another is that, by dampening
interest rate increases, they can encourage non-tradable prices to rise, especially
those related to housing. Finally, appreciation pressures can easily reverse,
which can then require hikes in the policy rate. It is noteworthy that some of
the largest nominal increases in policy rates since the beginning of 2006 were
observed in Turkey and South Africa. These countries experienced significant
depreciation pressures during the episode of market volatility in May–June 2006.
In addition to allowing policy rates to be set at lower levels than otherwise,
appreciation pressures have been met by heavy intervention in foreign exchange

markets. This has resulted in very large and persistent foreign reserve
accumulation (see Chapter V) and the concomitant need to sterilise the
reserves thus created. In a number of countries, including China, sterilisation
through increases in reserve requirements and sales of central bank securities
has proved increasingly difficult or subject to unwanted side effects. Reserve
requirements paying less than the market rate are effectively a tax on banks.
In less than fully integrated markets, moreover, the sale of sterilisation
instruments can actually push up their rate of return to levels that attract still
more capital inflows.
A number of countries have also used prudential measures to dampen
rapid credit growth and address sectoral or financial stability concerns. For
example, in India risk weights were raised for housing loans (from 50% to 75%,
subsequently reversed), commercial real estate (from 100% to 150%) and
consumer credit (from 100% to 125%). The general provisioning requirement
for loans in specific sectors was also raised.
Countries have also sought to lessen the effect of capital inflows by
encouraging capital outflows and by making it easier for domestic residents to
acquire or hold foreign currency. Restrictions on foreign investment or foreign
currency asset holdings were liberalised last year in China, India, Korea and
Thailand. The measures taken included increasing the allowable foreign
currency deposits of corporate residents (Thailand) or permitting larger
purchases of foreign currency (China), providing incentives for residents to
invest in foreign securities and real estate assets (Korea) and allowing more
portfolio investment abroad (China and India). However, the extent to which
these measures have dampened appreciation pressures to date remains unclear.
Difficulties in dealing with persistent appreciation pressures prompted
Thailand to try to restrict capital inflows. Initially, this involved limits on nonresident holdings of securities and non-resident loans to domestic financial

institutions that had no underlying trade or investment function. In December
2006, unremunerated reserve requirements were imposed on short-term
inflows along the lines seen earlier in Chile. While a number of these controls
have since been reduced, in response to a strongly negative reaction in
affected markets, the underlying upward pressure on the Thai baht apparently
eased. More recently, Colombia imposed similar capital controls.
Judging by central bank and market commentary, sterilisation and the
supplementary measures cited above have not been fully effective in curbing
the liquidity associated with the inflows of foreign currency. Indeed, in a cross
section of countries since 2003, reserve accumulation seems to have been
associated with rapid base money and credit growth, and higher inflation
(Graph III.5). While such simple correlations need to be interpreted with
caution, they reinforce the impression that relatively easy monetary conditions
associated with upward pressure on the currency could still lead to higher
inflation.

Medium-term fiscal adjustment and debt management
Debt stabilisation and reduction

Gross public debt
fell …

The resilience of EMEs and their attractiveness to investors depend to a great
extent on the government balance sheet position and the commitment to fiscal
adjustment. Policymakers have actively sought to enhance macroeconomic
stability through the stabilisation or reduction of public debt, and a variety of
debt management operations geared towards improving financing conditions.
Gross public debt (Graph III.6, left-hand panel, the sum of domestic and
external) has fallen not only in EMEs that are net commodity exporters but also

in those that are net commodity importers. The median debt/GDP ratio for all
EMEs fell around 14 percentage points to 33% between 2003 and 2006, with Brazil,
Chile, Colombia, Indonesia, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Thailand, Turkey and
Venezuela showing particularly large debt reductions (exceeding 10% of GDP).
The reductions in gross public debt ratios reflect in part the dynamics of
robust growth and low interest rates and, in countries with significant debt
denominated in foreign currency, the effects of domestic currency appreciation.
However, a more sustainable foundation for the debt reduction is an underlying
improvement in government fiscal balances. As illustrated in Graph III.7,
budget deficits have fallen and public revenues have increased, particularly
among net commodity exporters. These outcomes reflect marked improvements
in fiscal discipline; primary balances (which exclude interest payments on
debt) have risen considerably in recent years (Graph III.7, centre panel) and
have played a role in debt reduction since 2000.
Primary balances are estimated to have increased moderately in 2006,
and there are some grounds for confidence that the fiscal improvements seen
to date can be sustained. For countries with large receipts from commodity
exports or robust growth, the principal concern has been to ensure that cyclical
expenditures do not rise commensurately. In a closely related vein, a number
of countries have created stabilisation funds that would allow smoothing of
government spending during bad times, using revenues accumulated during
good times. Some countries have gone beyond the concept of a cyclical
stabilisation fund to introduce wealth funds designed to support future
generations when the country’s non-renewable resources run out. For
example, starting in February 2008, Russia’s current oil stabilisation fund will
be split into a reserve fund and a fund for future generations. In addition to
taxes on crude oil (which are currently accumulating in the oil stabilisation
fund), the two funds will receive the bulk of revenues from the mineral
resource extraction tax for oil and gas, and export duties for oil, gas and oil

products. The reserve fund will be maintained at a level equivalent to 10% of
GDP. In Singapore, even in the absence of mineral resources, the Government
Investment Corporation has for many years managed the equivalent of a
wealth fund on behalf of the state. It invests accumulated surpluses from
the government and from workers’ contributions to a state-run Central
Provident Fund.
Nevertheless, there are still concerns about fiscal positions. A number of
countries have public debt exceeding 50% of GDP even though current
conditions are unusually favourable. In the past, countries with such high debt
ratios tended to fail tests of debt sustainability (that is, primary balances do
not rise to counter rising debt levels). Even countries which currently pass
such sustainability tests might fail them if economic growth or commodity
prices were to fall sharply, or if interest rates were to rise significantly for an
extended period.

Debt management

… lengthen
maturities and
lower foreign debt

Debt sustainability depends on the composition as well as the size of debt.
Short-duration debt exposes borrowers to interest rate and refinancing risks.
A large share of foreign currency denominated debt creates exposures to
currency depreciation.
To reduce such risks, and to increase resilience to shocks, a number of
EMEs have undertaken debt management operations. These operations, which
are sometimes embodied in formal debt management principles (eg in Mexico),
are aimed at improving the terms of financing, extending maturities, reducing
currency mismatches and making greater use of domestic rather than
international capital markets. For example, in September 2006 Turkey engaged
in a maturity-extending transaction, launching a 10-year global bond in
exchange for short-dated higher-coupon bonds and cash. Other transactions
have focused on replacing external debt with domestic debt denominated in
local currency. While such operations can raise the immediate interest costs of
financing (domestic currency debt typically bears a higher rate than foreign
currency debt), they reduce vulnerability to exchange rate depreciation. To this
end, in August 2006 Mexico bought back $12 billion in external loans and
bonds for peso liabilities. At the same time, EMEs have sought to increase the
issuance of fixed rate debt at longer maturities.
Overall, these operations have served, first, to lengthen the average
maturity of public debt, other than that used in sterilisation operations. This is
reflected in the rise in longer-term debt compared to short-term debt among net
commodity importers (Graph III.6, centre panel). Moreover, the classification
shown does not capture lengthening maturities past one year, which have been
observed in some countries, notably Mexico. Second, the share of foreign
currency debt has fallen, reducing exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. In
Brazil, the share of external or foreign currency-linked debt, net of reserves, fell
from nearly 39% of GDP in 2002 to less than 10% in 2006. In Turkey, the
corresponding ratios fell from 56% to 36%. Aggregate currency mismatches,
a major cause of the crises in the 1980s and 1990s, have been reduced.
With many EMEs running surpluses, both public and total external debt has

fallen (Graph III.6, left- and right-hand panels), increasing the resilience of
these economies.

Foreign currency flows and asset prices in EMEs
One of the lessons of the 1990s crises is that capital flows can matter a great
deal for macroeconomic outcomes. The Asian crisis of 1997 was preceded by
appreciation pressures associated with capital inflows, and easy money which
led in turn to higher asset prices. “Sudden stops” or reversals in capital inflows
were then linked with sharp currency depreciation, collapsing asset prices and
severe downturns. Previous current account deficits and losses associated
with currency mismatches aggravated these problems, sometimes leading to
banking crises.
Some similarities to pre-1997 crisis conditions are apparent in EMEs today,
including appreciation pressures, easy money and higher asset prices. There are,
however, also important differences compared with the earlier period. With some
notable exceptions, appreciation pressures have been associated with current
account surpluses. Moreover, foreign exchange reserves have reached record
levels, exceeding conventional thresholds of reserve adequacy in most EMEs.

Stylised facts
Emerging markets are currently flush with foreign liquidity. One indicator of
this is the sharp exchange rate appreciation in some countries; another is
large foreign reserve accumulation. Foreign reserves in a set of EMEs have
grown rapidly in recent years, to reach $3 trillion, or about 27% of GDP in
these economies by the end of 2006. China’s reserve accumulation accounted
for a large proportion of the increase last year (nearly 44%), although the
shares of Russia (21%), India, Korea and Brazil (5–7% each) have also been
significant (Table III.2; see also Chapter V).
In contrast to the 1990s, the main source of foreign currency inflows in
recent years has been current account surpluses rather than capital flows. The
aggregate current account surplus of the EMEs rose to over $600 billion in
2006. Net private capital inflows have amounted to less than half the value of
current account surpluses on aggregate. Indeed, while net private capital
flows to EMEs in US dollar terms are close to all-time highs, and above
the peaks observed in the mid-1990s, as a proportion of GDP they have fallen
considerably in some major regions. Foreign direct investment (FDI) and
banking flows are now larger than portfolio investment flows (Graph III.8).
Nevertheless, capital flows to some regions (eg the Commonwealth of
Independent States, central and eastern Europe) have been particularly
significant. Capital inflows have also continued to finance current account
deficits in Hungary, India, South Africa and Turkey.
This pattern of international balances has three implications. First, large
current account surpluses imply that EMEs are less vulnerable to shocks and
“sudden stops” in capital flows than in the past. During the 2006 episode of
emerging financial market volatility, it was those countries with large current
account deficits which proved most vulnerable to financial stress. In addition,

pressures

the large share of rather stable FDI in capital flows makes capital flow
reversals less likely.
Second, government policies in a number of countries imply that current
account surpluses could lead to persistent appreciation pressures. Some EMEs
still impose foreign currency surrender requirements on exporters while
restricting capital outflows. This implies that large foreign currency inflows from
current account surpluses, as well as from capital flows, enter the foreign
exchange market. Many countries continue to resist the ensuing appreciation
pressures, with the implications cited earlier.

of emerging market assets. Gross portfolio investment inflows have been
significant in recent years in a number of countries (Graph III.8). For example,
according to one recent estimate, gross capital inflows to emerging Asian
economies, at around 5–6% of GDP in 2006, were close to their mid-1990s
highs (prior to the Asian and Russian crises). As a result, foreign holdings of
local currency debt instruments have risen sharply in a set of EMEs (Brazil, the
Czech Republic, Hungary, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia, South Africa
and Turkey), although outside central Europe the foreign shares are still
comparatively small. Furthermore, the share of emerging equity markets that
is open to foreign investors, based on market capitalisation, is comparatively
high, at around 34% of the total in December 2006 (based on the IFC index).
However, it is hard to detect a trend in foreign access because of the volatility
of equity market indices and the investable (to foreigners) components.
Large funds and institutional investors from developed markets, as well
as hedge funds, account for the bulk of gross portfolio inflows into EMEs.
Pension funds and fixed income funds are gradually diversifying their
portfolios internationally to include emerging markets, while the assets under
management of hedge funds that follow an emerging markets strategy are
estimated to have risen sharply in recent years (see Chapter VI). Moreover,
foreign investors can increasingly take positions in emerging market assets
without this necessarily being reflected in the capital flow data. One way is
through the active use of derivatives, specifically non-deliverable forward
contracts in emerging market currencies.
A number of economic factors appear to be driving increased foreign
participation in the asset markets of EMEs. These include push factors such as
greater risk appetite, continuing low relative returns in developed financial
markets and the recycling of petrodollars to non-oil-producing EMEs. At the
same time, pull factors, such as improved fundamentals, have played a major
role. For example, reduced external or public debt (see above) has been

reflected in higher sovereign ratings, which have attracted foreign investors.
Technological developments have also encouraged investment in emerging
financial markets by making it much easier to monitor developments there.
Growing capital inflows have been masked by large capital outflows,
reflecting the rising stock of private financial assets in EMEs, government
liberalisation of outward investment, and foreign investment by government
entities (including the commodity stabilisation funds or wealth funds cited
earlier). Over the past two years, gross portfolio outflows have been
comparatively high (relative to other EMEs) in China, Korea, Malaysia, Russia
and Saudi Arabia.

Implications for asset markets in EMEs
Returns on
emerging market
assets have risen

Stock market
capitalisation has
also increased

Growing integration with global financial markets appears to have been
associated with a substantial increase in returns on emerging market assets
(Graph III.9). Returns in emerging equity markets have been particularly high
and, in spite of occasional episodes of volatility, they have significantly
exceeded the return on bonds, whether domestic (centre panel) or international
(right-hand panel). The extent to which equities are more volatile than bonds
appears to be greater (Graph III.10). This can have macroeconomic implications.
At the same time, rising asset prices have brought corresponding increases in
financial wealth, raising the possibility that asset price fluctuations could have
a bigger impact on aggregate demand than before.
To illustrate some orders of magnitude, stock market capitalisation ratios
in EMEs have increased significantly in the course of this decade, and now
average 79% of GDP in Asia (excluding Hong Kong SAR and Singapore), 47%
in Latin America and 38% in central Europe. Even so, they remain below the
percentages observed in the United States (124%) or Japan (108%). Recent
research suggests that the long-run marginal propensity to consume out of a

change in the value of equity wealth is still relatively small in the United States:
about 1 cent on the dollar in the short run and 4 cents in the long run (by way
of comparison, the corresponding estimates are from 2 to 9 cents on the dollar
for housing wealth).
Wealth effects in EMEs might, however, be smaller to the extent that
equity market holdings are held mainly by the wealthier segments of the
population and foreigners (rather than more broadly by households, as in the
United States or Japan).
As noted above, wealth effects associated with other assets, notably real
property, might also be important. The experience of the 1990s Asian crisis
suggests that the creation of liquidity associated with foreign exchange market
intervention can contribute to a sharp run-up in property prices and a “boombust” cycle capable of producing considerable economic and financial sector
disruption. Today, this could apply to countries where credit to the private
sector has grown rapidly. Data limitations make it difficult to evaluate risks,
but in 2006 property prices rose significantly (eg at near double digit rates or
higher) in Korea and South Africa as well as in the cities of Manila and
Mumbai. Rapid credit growth suggests that there could also have been price
increases in other markets for which property price data are not available. In
some cases, there has been concern that foreign investors contribute directly to
volatility in domestic property markets through their investments. In China this
has prompted the government to restrict such investments, while in India the
government has recently restricted foreign borrowing in the real estate sector.
There are, however, also reasons to believe that EMEs could be more
resilient to property market shocks than before. First, as noted earlier, the most
rapid growth in credit has been in countries with relatively low credit/GDP
ratios. Second, property price increases in some cases are not widespread. For
example, in Korea the fastest price rises appear to be confined to certain
wealthy neighbourhoods, affecting a limited segment of the population. Third,

many countries have absorbed the lessons of the crises of the 1990s and have
strengthened their financial sectors with a view to containing risks.
Growing foreign participation in emerging financial markets contributes
to greater financial market depth and efficiency. Nevertheless, two concerns
have sometimes been raised. One is that a powerful foreign presence could
increase volatility in small markets, by driving prices away from domestic
fundamentals. The second is that domestic markets might become more
exposed to spillovers or contagion from shocks abroad. As to the first
concern, there is some evidence of “returns chasing” (investment in assets with
already high returns) in Asian equity markets. This could mean that the high
returns observed in those markets have been amplified by the participation of
foreign investors. Furthermore, certain investment strategies, such as carry
trades seeking to exploit higher EME asset yields, have implied persistently
favourable excess returns, in apparent violation of the arbitrage or interest
rate parity conditions implied by efficient markets. Either of these situations
could pave the way for overshooting and prospective volatility. Moreover, and
perhaps even more dangerous, foreign investors might possibly be more
inclined to “cut and run” than domestic residents, introducing greater volatility
in asset markets.
As for increased exposure to foreign shocks, the correlation between
global and emerging market equity returns appears to have risen since mid2004 (when the Federal Reserve began a cycle of tightening) compared to the
2001–04 period (Graph III.11).
Furthermore, this correlation rose even higher during the most recent
periods of global market volatility (May–June 2006 and February–March 2007).
Although such correlations need to be interpreted with caution, they could
indicate that emerging equity markets might now be more exposed to
external shocks than in the past, particularly during periods of high market
volatility.
Nevertheless, there is also some evidence supporting the view that
greater integration with global markets has not been associated with higher

volatility in emerging market financial asset prices. First, higher correlations
between world and emerging market indices apply to equities but are less
apparent for domestic bonds (Graph III.11). Second, price/earnings ratios in
many EMEs do not appear high compared to developed markets. The median
trailing price/earnings ratio in EMEs was recently around 15, about the same as
in the euro area, but less than the US ratio of 18. It should be noted, however,
that the cross-country dispersion in emerging market price/earnings ratios
has recently risen considerably, nearly tripling since mid-2006. As a result,
ratios are much higher in some EMEs, including China, where they rose to
34 by mid-May 2007. Third, as illustrated in Graph III.10, market volatility
has generally fallen since the late 1990s, when foreign participation was
smaller. While prima facie this might indicate that foreign participation has
not heightened volatility, this conclusion must be tempered by the fact that
lower volatility has also been seen in many other markets. This implies
that an increase in global risk aversion might still have significant effects
on EMEs.

China’s international trade: stylised facts and implications
Since its accession to the WTO in December 2001, China’s share in world
exports has doubled to 8% (Graph III.12). At the same time, it has also become
one of the top five destinations for emerging Asia’s exports. Underlying these
changes is the country’s emergence as a global manufacturing hub that
produces final goods by importing intermediate and capital goods. These
developments raise three questions. First, how are the trade opportunities for
China’s trading partners being affected? Second, how has the exposure of
these partners to external shocks changed? Third, what are the implications
for regional exchange rate policies?

Changing trade patterns
China is an
important market
for Asia …

… importing
mainly production
inputs …

China’s emergence in global trade has been characterised by three features.
First, it has displaced some other Asian EMEs in the markets of advanced
industrial countries, but has also provided an important market for their goods.
The share of advanced industrial economies (the United States, the European
Union and Japan) in the exports of emerging Asia has tended to fall
(Table III.3), while the share of China’s exports to advanced industrial economies
has tended to rise (with Japan a striking exception). China’s share in the
exports of emerging Asia has risen, from 13% in 1996–2001 to 22% in 2005–06.
Over these periods, the share of emerging Asia in China’s imports rose from
31% to 35%.
Second, a significant proportion of China’s imports is accounted for by
production inputs, particularly for the export sector. About 70% of Chinese
imports consist of intermediate goods, and 57% of these goods come from
emerging Asia and Japan (Graph III.13, left-hand panel). At the same time,
consumption and capital goods make up 72% of Chinese exports to the United
States and 68% of those to the European Union. This illustrates a growing

vertical integration in the production process in Asia, responding to the fact
that certain countries seem to have a comparative advantage in one or other
stage of production. Chinese exports, therefore, have a comparatively high
import content and China’s value added is correspondingly low. Moreover,
distribution margins often account for an even larger proportion of the final
retail price for Chinese exports. As a result, a doll that sells for $20 in the United
States is estimated to contain only 35 cents of value added by Chinese labour.
As is also apparent in Graph III.13, China’s trading relationships extend
well beyond production networks in Asia. In particular, its imports have
contributed significantly to the demand for raw materials from the Middle East
and Latin America, recently accounting for about 5% and 3.3% respectively
of total exports from those regions. In Africa, the corresponding figure is
7%. Moreover, a substantial proportion of incremental demand for major
commodities can be attributed to China. For example, between 2004 and 2006,
it accounted on average for about 37% of the annual increase in world
demand for oil. China is now the second largest oil importer in Asia after
Japan, and demand is expected to increase by 5–7% a year. The country is
also the world’s largest consumer of commodities such as copper, nickel and
zinc and, given its high demand for such products, has been instrumental in
causing these prices to rise. This demand is likely to continue for some time
as China is still in the early stages of industrialisation, when infrastructure
investment is of particular importance.
Third, China is gradually shifting from exports of labour-intensive and less
advanced manufactured goods to more technology-intensive goods. Between
1998 and 2005, the share of consumption goods in exports of final goods fell
from 48% to 32%, while the share of capital goods rose from 15% to 26% (the
remainder are largely intermediate goods). The share of manufacturing exports
in total exports has also risen, with a growing share for more sophisticated

goods such as machinery (Graph III.14). The incentive to climb the technology
ladder was boosted by an announcement in September 2006 that tax rebates
would be abolished or reduced for certain export products with low value
added, or which contribute to high pollution or high consumption of resources.
The government has also invested heavily to foster research and development
in China, although the lack of adequate intellectual property protection there
remains a potential deterrent to high-tech commercial operations.

Medium-term implications: how has China affected trade opportunities?
China’s entry into
global trade
benefits some …

… but may be a
challenge to others

The preceding discussion suggests that China’s impact on trade opportunities
for other emerging markets is mixed because it is potentially both a competitor
and a new market for goods and services. For some commodity exporters in
Latin America and Africa which do not compete with China, its entry into the
world trading system offers clear benefits from terms-of-trade gains, although
there could also be some offset to the extent that these countries import oil.
Net benefits might also be expected for countries that have been displaced by
China in low value added or assembly operations, but which now supply it with
production inputs. For example, while Chinese competition might displace
PCs assembled in Korea for sale in developed countries, such effects could be
largely offset by increased Chinese demand for Korean PC components such
as semiconductors.
In contrast, countries competing with China in final goods, with no
offsetting sales of production inputs to the latter, will find their trade
opportunities reduced. China has displaced Mexico and Central America as
a supplier of textiles and garments to the US market, and is an emerging
competitor for goods embodying intermediate technology (electronics and
electrical goods, computers and automobile industry parts). Some other
countries have been affected in part because of their own domestic policies. To
illustrate: China is a world leader in sales of apparel in world markets, in direct

competition with India. Chinese imports of high-quality textiles to produce these
goods have grown, but are sourced mainly from Japan and the newly
industrialised economies. China does not import these textiles from India, even
though India is the world’s second largest producer. In part, this has been
due to export restrictions on India’s textile industry imposed by the Indian
government.
The medium-term trade opportunities created by China’s global integration
would be considerably greater if its import demand began to reflect its own final
domestic demand, as well as the derived demand from those to whom it
exports. This is not yet the case. Final consumption goods constitute only 4%
of China’s total imports and calculations suggest that the elasticity of demand
for its ordinary imports (ie those not used for processing in the export sector)
with respect to domestic spending is insignificant. In line with this, China also
appears to be engaged in large-scale import substitution; for example, it has
recently become self-sufficient in steel.
A related medium-term question is whether China’s rapid growth and
demand for commodities and intermediate imports are themselves sustainable.
Its very high rates of investment run the risk of supporting projects with low
or even negative returns. High rates of investment were also observed in East
Asia in the 1980s and early 1990s, culminating in the 1997–98 crisis.
Recent evidence suggests that the easier access to the formal financial
system enjoyed by China’s state-owned enterprises (SOEs) encourages
overinvestment and lowers the marginal return on capital. Indeed, productivity
levels at SOEs are roughly 30% lower than in private firms. It is estimated that
by allocating resources more efficiently, China could reduce its investment
levels by 5% of GDP and raise consumption without sacrificing economic
growth. At present, the authorities are seeking to contain unproductive
investments through a variety of administrative measures, by reducing credit
growth (at times selectively) and by tightening monetary policy. But such public
sector measures need to be supported by market forces that also operate
effectively and quickly to contain unproductive investments. Evidently, the
longer these resource misallocations are allowed to continue, the greater
the eventual fallout.
A related implication of easy access to credit has been a heavy
concentration of bank exposure on less profitable SOEs. According to
government figures, roughly 40% of industrial SOEs make losses. The bulk of
recorded aggregate profits are earned by relatively few enterprises, which fund
themselves primarily from retained earnings rather than borrowing from banks.
This implies that a substantial proportion of lending by China’s banks could
turn into non-performing loans should the country’s economy slow significantly.
Presumably, this would also have sizeable fiscal implications unless Chinese
banks were to become considerably more profitable in the interim.
An additional medium-term concern for more technologically advanced
competitors, such as Korea, is the possibility of their being “hollowed out” due
to an increasing tendency to shift manufacturing jobs to China. There is some
room for optimism in this regard. Although China has attracted the bulk of FDI
flows to emerging markets, its share has fallen, from a peak of 39% in 2003 to

26% in 2006. Furthermore, with the notable exceptions of Japan, Hong Kong
SAR and Taiwan (China), the share of manufacturing production in GDP has
not declined in other emerging Asian economies since 1993. However, this
does not rule out the possibility that employment in the manufacturing sector
could still fall in response to increases in productivity, as appears to have
occurred in the United States and a number of other advanced industrial
countries.

Exposure and resilience of emerging Asia (excluding China) to shocks
Large impact from
a US slowdown …

… or smaller impact
from a Chinese
slowdown

China’s growing prominence in world trade has changed the channels through
which external demand shocks are transmitted to EMEs, and has also
influenced the pattern of co-movement in trade flows. A US slowdown affects
emerging Asia by lowering demand for its exports to the United States (direct
demand effect), but it also has indirect effects coming through the slower US
demand for Chinese exports. For instance, a 10% slowdown in US imports
directly lowers Korea’s exports by 1.5%. However, the same shock also
reduces China’s exports by 2.1%, which causes a further drop in imports from
Korea. Under certain assumptions, these indirect effects lower Korean exports
by another 1.3% (Graph III.15). A US slowdown could also cause the US dollar
to depreciate against Asian currencies, which would further amplify both the
direct and the indirect effects.
The lack of response of China’s imports of final products to changes in
domestic demand, cited earlier, indicates that a Chinese slowdown would have
smaller effects on Asian economies than would a US slowdown. However, this
also suggests that the extent to which China could provide a cushion to the
Asian economies in the event of an adverse global demand shock would also
be more limited.

Implications for exchange rate policies
The development of trade networks is likely to affect exchange rate policies,
but the precise effects will depend on the extent of direct trade competition,
trade through production networks and the resulting business cycle
synchronisation. For example, an increase in US demand for China’s exports
in equilibrium would require a renminbi appreciation against the dollar. The
exchange rate response of China’s Asian neighbours would then depend
on the extent to which they compete with China or form part of a (vertically
integrated) production network with it.
On the one hand, to the extent that its neighbours compete with China in
third markets, they would wish to see their currencies fall against the renminbi.
One indicator of this is the overlap in goods exported: between China and
Thailand, for instance, this measure grew from 50% in 1998 to 55% in 2005;
between China and Korea, it increased from 44% to 56% during the same
period. In contrast, China does not compete at all with most Latin American
countries (except Mexico).
On the other hand, to the extent that its Asian neighbours are linked to
China through production networks, as discussed earlier, demand for their
exports to China is set to grow. To avoid external imbalances or overheating,
these economies therefore have an incentive to allow their currencies to

business cycles resulting from production networks would tend to link East
Asian currencies more closely to China’s. This effect may be dampened,
however, to the extent that trade flows are not sensitive to exchange rate
changes.
China’s emergence as a major trading country has already had a substantial
impact on the global economy. How it succeeds in achieving substainable
growth will have major consequences for the rest of the world in the years
ahead.

IV. Monetary policy in the advanced industrial
countries

Highlights
During the period under review, the stance of monetary policy generally
tightened as central banks in the advanced industrial countries raised policy
rates. The shift largely reflected rising resource utilisation in the context of
expanding global demand and the concomitant threat of inflation pressures.
Elevated commodity prices, especially very high crude oil prices early in the
period, added to concerns that short-term inflation momentum could spill over
to longer-term inflation expectations.
In the United States, the Federal Reserve kept rates on hold for most of
the period, as economic activity moderated and inflation pressures for the
most part were expected to recede. Concerns grew, however, that a desired
moderation of US core inflation would not materialise. The ECB tightened
policy appreciably, basing its decisions on, amongst other things, diminishing
economic slack and rapid growth of money and credit. The Bank of Japan found
itself in a different set of circumstances. With previous structural impediments
to growth largely behind it, the Japanese economy showed more promising
signs of a sustained recovery. The Bank of Japan used its new “two-perspective”
framework for monetary policy to explain two increases in the policy rate,
which nonetheless left it very low at the end of the period.
Other advanced industrial countries generally tightened monetary policy in
the face of a diverse mix of external and domestic forces. The Bank of Canada,
the Bank of England, the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Reserve Bank of
New Zealand tightened in the context of already relatively high policy rates,
but with inflation running in the middle or on the high side of policymakers’
preferences. The Central Bank of Norway, Sveriges Riksbank and the Swiss
National Bank made further progress towards normalising policy rates from a
comparatively low starting point.
Although policy interest rates were raised, and inflation on the whole was
kept low, concerns have been expressed in some quarters about rapid money
and credit growth. These concerns have been shaped in part by the evolving
views about the appropriate role of monetary and credit aggregates in the
conduct of monetary policy. To clarify the debate, the final section of this
chapter assesses the range of views against the backdrop of central bank
experiences over the past 35 years.

5.25% in June 2006, the 17th consecutive 25 basis point increase, and then
held the target rate stable (Graph IV.1). However, this stability belied the
shifting risks that policymakers had to balance as economic and inflation
outlooks evolved. For most of the period, the central question for the Federal
Reserve was whether additional moves, largely oriented towards tightening,
would be necessary to ensure a gradual decline in core inflation and
sustainable economic growth. But, as the year wore on, concerns that output
might significantly overshoot its sustainable path began to wane as economic
activity moderated. Subsequent economic performance proved to be largely
consistent with the Federal Reserve’s view that, in a lagged response to higher
interest rates, the economy, and in particular the housing market, would
decelerate.
Incoming data in late 2006 and early 2007 weighed particularly heavily on
the Federal Reserve’s assessment of the prospects for growth. Several
countervailing forces were at work, raising uncertainties about the appropriate
policy setting. While the ongoing adjustments in the interest-sensitive sectors
contributed to a welcome moderation in economic activity, growing troubles in
the subprime mortgage market led to concerns about a deeper and more
pronounced softening in the housing sector (see Chapter II). Evidence of only
modest knock-on effects on other markets, and on consumers’ willingness to
spend, provided some confidence that the potential fallout would be limited in
the near term. However, against this backdrop, the somewhat atypical
sluggishness in business fixed investment (despite low credit spreads, healthy
profits and moderate expansion of aggregate demand) took on increased
significance in assessing the downside risks to growth.
At the same time, the Federal Reserve expressed concern about the
elevated level of core inflation and the possibility of a pickup in inflation
expectations. While high energy and non-energy commodity prices contributed

to the slowing of economic activity, they also put upward pressure on headline
inflation. Moreover, there appeared to be a gradual pass-through to core
inflation, especially during 2006. Even though energy price pressures were
subsiding by the end of the year, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)
became increasingly worried that core inflation might be running near or
above the upper end of the range most conducive to achieving sustainable
growth and price stability over the medium term. While the FOMC expected
core inflation to moderate, it also attached significant weight to the possibility
that inflation might not decline as much as expected, as a result of which
inflation expectations might become entrenched at too high a rate (Graph IV.2).
This possibility was heightened by labour markets becoming increasingly
tight and wage pressures in some sectors picking up. And, in the light of
evidence implying some flattening of the short-run Phillips curve, reducing
inflation could entail greater output costs than in the past.
The Federal Reserve’s communication with the public also evolved during
the period under review. As the policy outlook became increasingly
data-dependent, the FOMC noted that the public would generally find it harder
to fully anticipate future policy decisions owing to the more contingent nature of
its policy statements. Although this development did not signal a change in the
FOMC’s transparency, it nonetheless left an imprint on financial markets, as
illustrated by swings in six-month-ahead implied policy rates from federal funds
futures in 2007. However, as the implied volatility from options indicated, the
general level of uncertainty remained near historical lows (Graph IV.2).
By the end of the period, markets viewed the near-term direction of the
federal funds rate as being somewhat more uncertain than it had been on
average in the previous few years. On the one hand, as long as core inflation
continued to run at the upper limit of, or even above, the FOMC’s apparent

BIS 77th Annual Report

61

comfort level, the Committee left open the possibility of its needing to raise
rates or extend the period over which current rates would be maintained. On
the other hand, if the FOMC’s expectations of moderating core inflation were
realised without an adjustment in the policy rate, or if the economy decelerated
more sharply than expected, rates would probably be adjusted downwards.
Even so, long-term interest rates remained low, appearing to be somewhat
insensitive to these short-term uncertainties, and traded in a narrow corridor
around 5%.

Euro area
Monetary policy in the euro area was tightened appreciably during the period
under review. The ECB raised its policy rate to 3.75% in five 25 basis point
moves, continuing the process of interest rate normalisation begun at the end
of 2005. Previously, the policy rate had been increased to 2.5% from the
historically low level of 2% that had prevailed for two and a half years
(Graph IV.3). The tightening was largely in response to indications of upside
inflation risks drawn from both the economic and the monetary analyses of
the ECB, even though realised inflation remained well contained. Despite its
actions, the ECB still assessed policy to be on the accommodative side at the
end of the period. Market participants also appeared to expect policy to be
tightened further in 2007, to around 41/4%, about 75 basis points above where
markets had expected the tightening episode to end a year before.
Market participants’ expected path for the policy rate shifted up over the
period under review, in large part because the pace of economic activity and
associated momentum were more vigorous than had been expected, potentially
resulting in heightened inflation pressures. Real GDP growth in 2006 exceeded the
upper limit of the range forecast by ECB staff earlier in the year. Moreover, their
projection for output growth in 2007 was marked up by about 1/2 percentage point.

Headline HICP inflation fell over the period to 1.9% in March 2007,
consistent with the ECB’s price stability objective of below but close to 2%.
Core inflation remained subdued, but drifted up. The ECB projected headline
inflation to be in a range centred slightly below 2% in 2007 and on 2% in 2008.
Nevertheless, it considered the inflation outlook to be subject to upside risks.
The robust advance in output had coincided with a drop in the unemployment
rate to historically low levels, and the ECB expressed concern that wage gains
could pick up as a consequence (see Chapter II). Also contributing to the
assessment that risks were tilted to the upside were the potential for renewed
oil price increases and the possibility of additional upward adjustments in
administered prices and indirect taxes.
The ECB’s monetary analysis confirmed the assessment that there were
upside risks to the inflation outlook. Annual M3 growth picked up to 10.9% in
March 2007, the highest level since the introduction of the euro. Moreover,
unlike in previous years, the rapid rise in M3 did not appear to reflect shifts out
of longer-term investments. Rather, it seemed primarily to reflect efforts by
financial institutions to fund continued robust asset growth. Total credit
extended by monetary financial institutions to euro area residents in March
2007 was 7.7% above its year-earlier level. The continued substantial
increases in euro area monetary and credit aggregates reflected the generally
low interest rates, solid economic expansion and strong property market
developments in many parts of the euro area – a build-up of liquidity and a
constellation of factors that the ECB saw as requiring especially careful
monitoring.
The successes of, and challenges to, ECB communication efforts were
reflected in the response of financial markets to monetary developments. The
Bank sought to be reasonably predictable in its near-term policy actions, and
broadly succeeded. Market participants have been able to anticipate policy
moves quite accurately over the current tightening episode (Graph IV.4). The
probability of a rate rise at the next monthly meeting of the Governing Council,
as implied by interest rate futures, either jumped to essentially 100% or fell to
virtually zero in response to the statements released after each meeting,
remaining close to those values until the next policy decision, which was in
each case correctly anticipated. This predictability of near-term policy actions
could have contributed to the decline of Euribor implied volatilities to
historically low levels. However, similar declines were also seen in a broader
array of financial market measures of uncertainty (see Chapter VI).
On the other hand, the ECB recognises that conveying clearly how money
growth is factored into policy decisions has been challenging. In fact, there is
some evidence that market participants did not pay especially close attention
to M3 statistical releases during the period under review, despite repeated
indications from the ECB that the marked acceleration in M3 was an important
contributing factor to its assessment that there were upside risks to inflation. In
particular, money market interest rate futures did not respond significantly on
the day of data releases pointing to higher or lower annual money growth than
expected by the markets. At the same time, it remains unclear whether this
reflects communication difficulties or a link that, by its nature, is too episodic

Japan
During the period under review, the Bank of Japan maintained a very low policy
rate with the intention of keeping financing conditions accommodative.
Nonetheless, as economic slack shrank and underlying downward price
pressures subsided, it saw the need to raise the rate twice, thereby ending its
zero interest rate policy. The target rate was increased to around 0.25% in July
2006 and then to around 0.50% in February 2007 (Graph IV.5). These moves,
along with expectations of further gradual increases, were seen by the central
bank as consistent with the goal of sustainable economic growth and price
stability.
The end of the zero interest rate policy reflected in large part an
increasingly favourable macroeconomic backdrop, characterised by
strengthening corporate balance sheets, structural adjustments in the financial
system and a pickup in headline inflation in early 2006. The multi-year efforts
of firms to shed excess production capacity, labour and debt appeared to have
come to an end. The financial system had made significant progress in
reducing its chronic non-performing loan burden and was showing clear signs
of more normal lending practices. The Bank of Japan also interpreted the
expansion of broad monetary aggregates and lending as a reflection of growing
public confidence in the long-awaited return of stability to the financial system.
The decision to raise policy interest rates modestly also illustrated how
the Bank of Japan was using its new two-perspective framework. The new
framework was introduced in March 2006 (see the 76th Annual Report ). The
first monetary policy perspective focuses on developments affecting output

and inflation over the one- to two-year horizon. The second perspective
emphasises risks, and their associated costs, over a longer horizon. This
approach implies that policy might be tightened even in situations where the
risks of rising inflation over the short run are judged to be negligible.
The first perspective factored heavily into the July 2006 decision to raise
the policy rate to 0.25%. At the time, the Bank of Japan expected a continued
expansion of domestic and external demand, which would naturally lead to
increased resource utilisation rates and less downward pressure on unit labour
costs. Driven by surging energy prices in early 2006, measures of headline and
core inflation showed both moving above zero and towards the middle of the
Bank of Japan’s preferred inflation range of zero to 2%.
The second perspective also played a role in the decision. The Bank’s
Policy Board was concerned about the possible longer-term implications of
resource misallocations that might arise from holding interest rates too low for
too long. Part of the concern was that firms might embark on projects under the
unrealistic assumption that such accommodative financing conditions would
be maintained, irrespective of the likely paths for economic activity and prices.
While acknowledging that there existed little firm evidence of overinvestment,
the Bank of Japan nonetheless factored this possibility into its decision.
Resource misallocation, if left unchecked, poses serious risks to sustainable
future economic growth. In a sense, the aim was not to cool an overheating
economy per se, but to ensure that the experience of the late 1980s was not
repeated.
The subsequent policy rate move in early 2007 illustrated the importance
of the second perspective even more clearly. On this occasion, the Bank of
Japan noted that the first perspective provided little justification for additional
tightening. Economic activity was gaining traction, but core prices were losing
upward momentum as the short-term deceleration in energy prices took hold.
Indeed, abstracting from energy prices, consumer prices were not obviously

BIS 77th Annual Report

65

rising. Nevertheless, risks of a sustained deflation were no longer a major
concern. In part, this was because the Policy Board continued to see an
upward underlying price trend, primarily due to increased resource utilisation
and the expectation of continued expansion in economic activity. But another
factor was that the associated costs of a modest deflation were now judged
to be much smaller because of the improved economic and financial
fundamentals. In early 2007, output was growing, employee incomes were
rising, asset prices were up, banks were lending, and household and corporate
debt levels had subsided considerably from their 1990s peaks (Graph IV.6).
Moreover, it had become increasingly clear that the recent decline in headline
CPI had its origins in deregulation, globalisation and other positive supply
shocks, and was thus of a different nature to demand-driven deflation.
Instead, the Policy Board was primarily concerned that a policy rate
increase was needed to forestall the build-up of unsustainable conditions – in
other words, the possibility of overinvestment that would prove unprofitable.
In February, the Board was nearly unanimous in its decision to raise the policy
rate target to 50 basis points; still very low, but nonetheless the highest rate in
10 years. In fact, several Board members were already on record as having
voted for a policy rate hike in January. Carry trade issues and some localised
evidence of frothy land prices did not appear to factor prominently into the
Bank of Japan’s decision earlier this year.
These two policy actions were largely anticipated, as financial markets
reacted moderately and nominal long-term interest rates remained stable. The
muted responses were seen by the Bank of Japan as evidence that its newly
adopted monetary policy framework, and efforts to explain it to the public, were
effective in communicating its policy intentions. This was so despite some
short-lived market volatility in early January, when markets had incorrectly
expected a policy move.

At the end of the period under review, the Bank of Japan’s policy outlook
indicated that the very low interest rate environment would continue so as to
foster accommodative financial conditions and that, over time, policy rates
would probably adjust upwards gradually as developments warranted.

Inflation targeting countries

During the period under review, central banks in countries with explicit
numerical targets for inflation raised their policy rates, albeit at different times
and by different amounts (Graph IV.7). This tightening occurred in the context
of a continued expansion of the global economy and high commodity prices.

Domestic economic conditions in general were also strong, with most
economies experiencing rising inflation pressures as productive capacity and
labour markets became tighter. Despite this, inflation on the whole remained
low, owing in part to favourable import price developments for consumer
goods.
To varying degrees, these central banks expressed four concerns. First,
uncertainty about the global economic outlook remained high, even though the
projected outcome was deemed largely favourable. Indeed, it was difficult to
assess with confidence the full impact of rising policy rates in the major
advanced industrial countries. In particular, there was uncertainty surrounding
the implications of higher rates for the ongoing rotation of demand in the United
States, especially as regards housing activity. Second, stronger than expected
domestic demand raised concerns about higher price and cost pressures,
against the backdrop of generally elevated energy and other commodity prices.
Third, robust broad money and credit growth in some countries, especially
when associated with buoyant equity and house prices, continued to point to
two possible outturns. For the near term, strong domestic demand might
increase inflation pressures. For the longer term, the risk of a sharp reversal
in asset prices raised questions for some central banks about sustainable
economic growth. Finally, global imbalances remained large and capital flows
associated with carry trades persisted, posing the danger of disorderly
adjustments affecting both exchange rates and economic activity.
Against this backdrop, the central banks that started the period with
relatively high policy interest rates – those of Australia, Canada, New Zealand
and the United Kingdom – felt the need to tighten monetary policy further.
The Bank of Canada raised its policy rate by 25 basis points on two
occasions early in the period under review, to 4% in April 2006 and 4.25% in
May. It then kept its policy rate stable, despite an uptick in headline inflation
in early 2007, as economic activity evolved in line with projections and
inflation risks were seen as roughly balanced.
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand raised its official cash rate to 7.5% in
March 2007 and to 7.75% in April, after having kept it unchanged at 7.25%
since December 2005. This was the highest policy rate in the economies
covered in this chapter. Strengthening domestic demand was supported by a
resurgence in housing markets and expansionary fiscal policy. There was a
risk that inflation would be elevated over the medium term, and the Reserve
Bank noted that it might need to raise rates further.
The Reserve Bank of Australia raised its policy rate from 5.5% to 6.25% in
three 25 basis point moves in 2006. Income and spending were buoyed by high
commodity prices, spare capacity was limited, and the labour market remained
tight. Both headline and underlying CPI inflation ran at or above the Bank’s
medium-term target for most of the period. While the former had come back
into the target range at the end of the period, medium-term inflation risks
were still thought to remain significant.
The Bank of England raised its repo rate from 4.5% to 5.5% in four moves
between August 2006 and May 2007. Strong domestic demand squeezed
spare resource capacity further as CPI inflation swelled to just above 3%,

necessitating a letter of explanation from the Bank to the Chancellor of the
Exchequer. Policymakers also became increasingly concerned that rapid
growth in broad money and credit and buoyant asset prices were indications of
building inflationary pressures. Nonetheless, headline inflation was projected
to return slowly to target under the influence of tightening policy.
The central banks of Norway, Sweden and Switzerland began the period
with relatively low policy rates compared to the other inflation targeting
countries. Even though none of these central banks anticipated inflation rates
exceeding their targets over the next one to two years, continued economic
growth and the prospect of gradually rising inflation encouraged them to
remain firmly on the path of policy normalisation.
Starting in May 2006, the Central Bank of Norway lifted its sight deposit
rate from 2.5% to 4% in six 25 basis point increases. Even though inflation
remained well below the Bank’s target, the Norwegian economy had been in
a clear upswing since the summer of 2003, and its limited spare capacity was
dwindling further. Employment rose rapidly in the period under review and,
amid signs of higher wage growth, underlying inflation was expected to pick
up gradually. The central bank indicated its expectation that its policy rate
would move up to 5% by the end of 2007, and still higher thereafter.
Sveriges Riksbank raised its repo rate from 2% in June 2006 to 3.25% in
February 2007 in five consecutive moves, in response to brisk economic
activity. However, inflation remained near the Riksbank’s 2% target due to
downward price pressures from abroad, including falling energy prices in the
second half of 2006, and a stronger krona. Moreover, inflationary pressures
were expected to remain relatively limited. Nevertheless, the Riksbank
expected another potential 25 basis point hike before a possible pause on a
path of generally rising rates.
From June 2006, the Swiss National Bank raised the target range for
its policy rate in four consecutive 25 basis point moves, from 0.75–1.75% to
1.75–2.75%. Switzerland continued its economic recovery, with both external
and domestic demand, and especially private consumption, contributing to
above potential growth. Capacity utilisation rose considerably in 2006 and
unemployment was expected to fall further in 2007. After the dampening
effect of the drop in oil prices in the second half of 2006 wore off, inflation was
expected to begin to drift up in mid-2007 but to remain well within the Bank’s
inflation objective of below 2%.
Over the past year, many of these smaller advanced industrial economies
had to factor into their policy decisions the implications of strong capital flows,
in part associated with the so-called carry trade (see Chapter V). Capital
generally flowed from countries with low interest rates such as Switzerland
(and Japan) to those with relatively high rates such as Australia, New Zealand
and the United Kingdom (and some emerging market economies). This tended
to weaken the currencies of the former and to strengthen those of the latter.
These developments had a variety of implications for monetary policy, not least
the need to address the consequences of exchange rate movements for
aggregate demand and inflationary pressures. The downward pressure on
longer-term interest rates in the recipient countries also tended to offset

BIS 77th Annual Report

69

desired restraint imparted by higher policy rates, and the possibility of a sharp
adjustment from the current situation added risk to the outlook. By way of
example, the risk of a disorderly unwinding was one reason why the Reserve
Bank of New Zealand was more cautious in tightening monetary policy than it
might otherwise have been.
In early 2007, the Riksbank began publishing its projection of the future
policy rate path, following similar decisions by the Reserve Bank of New
Zealand in 1998 and the Central Bank of Norway in November 2005. The
interest in publishing forward-looking paths for policy rates has been growing in
recent years. It is seen by some central banks as a way to be more transparent
about the policy outlook, thereby improving the effectiveness of monetary
policy as well as leading to more accountability.
At the same time, these efforts are not without risks. Success is generally
thought to depend critically on whether the public truly understands the
conditional nature of the published forward-looking paths. If not, deviations
from an announced path could lead to a loss of monetary policy credibility. In
addition, it is important that central bank announcements of the expected future
path of policy rates do not adversely affect the quality of financial market
information, which central banks often use for cross-checking purposes. Such
an outturn could arise, for example, if financial market participants responded
to the paths by significantly reducing their own efforts to assess the
consequences of macroeconomic developments for their interest rate outlooks.
Finally, there is the risk that financial markets might take the published path as
a foregone conclusion and make one-way bets, leading to excessive risk-taking
in the financial system. The experiences of these central banks will provide
valuable lessons with which to judge the effectiveness of these newer
monetary policy approaches.

Monetary and credit aggregates in the conduct of monetary policy
A close look at how central banks behave, and how they communicate,
indicates that there are different views about the appropriate role of monetary
and credit (“quantitative”) aggregates in the conduct of monetary policy. These
views combine, to varying degrees, three conceptual perspectives on the role
of such aggregates in the economy. The first perspective reflects scepticism
about the reliability of aggregates in helping to chart the course of economic
activity and inflation, especially at short horizons. It would therefore not assign
a prominent role to them in policy frameworks. The second stresses the central
role of money as a causal driver of inflation. In particular, it emphasises the
special information content that monetary aggregates can have for mediumterm trends in inflation. Thus, it would assign a prominent role to these
aggregates in policy frameworks. The third, more recent, perspective stresses
the information content that unusually rapid increases in monetary and,
particularly, credit aggregates can have, especially if observed in association
with a surge in asset prices and unusual spending patterns. It regards these
increases as a potential sign of the build-up of financial imbalances and hence
of a prospective boom-bust cycle, with implications of significant economic

costs over time. Like the second perspective, this view would assign a
prominent role to quantitative aggregates in policy frameworks, but primarily as
indicators of medium-term risks in the form of recession, financial instability
and unwelcome disinflation.
This section provides a brief overview of past experiences and the history
of economic thought which form the backdrop for these different perspectives,
examines the extent to which they have been incorporated into current
monetary policy frameworks, and considers the challenges ahead. The stakes
in the debate at this policy juncture are high. As noted above, monetary and
credit aggregates have been rising sharply even though inflation has, so far,
remained quiescent (Graph IV.8). The question is: should this rapid growth be
a source of policy concern or not?

The changing role of money and credit prior to the 1980s
Quantity theory

Conceptually, emphasis on the key importance of money goes back to the
origins of the quantity equation in the 19th century. This theory states that
the quantity of money used in transactions multiplied by the number of times
it turns over in a year must be equal to all nominal transactions. This approach
became a key strand in modern macroeconomics, with nominal GDP being
used as a substitute for transactions. The distinction between money and
credit was, at least at the beginning, not clearly drawn. But, at the cost of some
oversimplification, credit tended to be more immediately associated with the
ability to obtain external funding to carry out transactions and to be regarded
as one potential source of the “supply” of money, via bank lending.
In the highly regulated financial systems of the 1950s and early 1960s,
credit growth took centre stage in policy implementation in many countries.
With various types of controls on interest rates and lending, credit availability
was regarded as a key channel to influence economic activity. At the same
time, however, little attention was paid to either money or credit as predictors
of inflation. Accumulating empirical evidence convinced many economists
and policymakers that inflation was largely determined by the level of the
unemployment rate. Indeed, the existence of this relationship (the Phillips

BIS 77th Annual Report

71

curve) was taken by many to mean that the level of output and employment
could be permanently increased by simply accepting a little more inflation. In
pursuit of this objective, monetary and credit aggregates were allowed to
accelerate, as this was not initially treated as a source of concern.
The subsequent unwelcome rise in inflation, and indeed its tendency
to accelerate as inflation expectations ratcheted up, was seen as a direct
indictment of the prevailing wisdom. The experience illustrated just how
unstable the Phillips curve could be if monetary policy actions were aiming at
an unemployment rate below the natural rate. Compounding the seriousness of
the charges, the monetarists, amongst many, had already challenged this view
from a theoretical perspective. They had warned that the pickup in money
growth would only stoke the flames of inflation, without any permanent effect
on economic slack (Graph IV.9). In the light of the subsequent inflationary
outturn, these views gained increasing influence within the central banking
world, encouraging central banks in the 1970s to seek to enhance their control
over inflation and the economy by using monetary aggregates as intermediate
target variables.
This was when the quantity equation experienced a renaissance.
Postulating that the ratio of nominal GDP to money (“velocity”) was stable, at
least over medium-term horizons, and that money did not affect output in the
long run provided the intellectual basis for central banks to control inflation
through their influence on the money stock.
Industrial countries across the board adopted the new approach to
monetary policy in the mid-1970s, although in differing degrees. Germany and
Italy were first in 1974; Canada, Switzerland and the United States followed
a year later, and Australia, France and the United Kingdom in 1976. To be sure,
the practices adopted varied widely. For example, Germany and the United
Kingdom chose broad measures of money as intermediate targets while the

United States and Canada chose M1. Whatever the differences in practices,
however, the goal was the same: to squeeze inflation out of the system. The
experiences of Germany, Switzerland and Japan in the 1970s were the first to
illustrate that attention to monetary aggregates could help to tame inflation.
The experience of the United States in the early 1980s, with inflation being
quickly reduced from double digits to about 4%, pointed in the same direction.

Various fixes tried

Against this backdrop, it might seem strange that monetary targeting fell out of
favour. Two factors, however, undermined it. First, in part, the policy eventually
became a victim of its own success. High and variable inflation is generally the
result of excessive and volatile monetary stimulus. But at lower rates, inflation
can, in the short run, be significantly influenced by many real factors that are
less amenable to control through monetary aggregates. Second, financial
deregulation and innovation over time changed the financial environment
sufficiently to reduce the reliability of monetary aggregates as a guide. In the
United States in the early 1980s, for example, M1 velocity veered sharply off its
trend and became more unpredictable. The lifting of interest rate ceilings on
transaction accounts and the introduction of a wide array of deposit accounts
complicated monetary control. Rapid financial innovation had similar effects
elsewhere. Even monetary targeting stalwarts such as Germany and
Switzerland were not immune to such developments: more liberal capital
flows across their borders became a significant complication in the tracking of
the relevant aggregates.
With the targets for monetary aggregates being missed, in many cases
systematically, central banks faced increasing difficulties in explaining their
actions (Graph IV.10). Naturally, attempts were made to “fix” the problems
arising from the changing circumstances, such as by adjusting the target bands
and redefining the monetary aggregates of choice. Even so, sceptics and
supporters of quantitative targeting alike became increasingly concerned about

the inconsistency between the rhetoric of monetary targeting and practice,
thereby raising questions about the framework as a credible medium-term
nominal anchor.
Given these difficulties, by the early 1990s short-run monetary targets had
largely been abandoned in the advanced industrial countries in favour of using
monetary aggregates as less prominent information variables about potential
inflation, particularly over medium-term horizons. This led a number of central
banks to adopt official, and sometimes unofficial, monitoring ranges for the
aggregates (see the 67th Annual Report for a chronology of such regime
changes for the advanced industrial countries). For some, the ranges were for
narrow and broad monetary aggregates as well as credit aggregates. But even
these were not without their challenges, especially as financial developments
continued to adversely affect the stability of velocity for extended periods of
time (Graph IV.11).
For completeness, however, it should be noted that the change in
approach was not universal. Germany continued to target the growth rate of
money from year to year (switching from central bank money to M3). Moreover,
in the 1990s Switzerland switched to a novel medium-term strategy based on
a three- to five-year average monetary growth rate.

Inflation targeting in the ascendancy
Arguably, the nadir of the formal use of monetary and credit aggregates
for monetary policy was reached with the adoption of inflation targeting
frameworks by a number of the smaller advanced industrial economies in the
late 1980s and early 1990s. These frameworks essentially involved targeting
the forecast of inflation one to two years ahead, by adjusting a short-term
interest rate (as the policy instrument). In making such forecasts, measures of
economic slack acquired greater prominence. To be sure, in principle nothing
ruled out the use of quantitative aggregates as important information variables
in forecasting. However, for all practical purposes, at many of these countries’

central banks the aggregates did not play any such role. After all, many of
these central banks adopted inflation targeting in the first place precisely
because monetary targeting strategies had failed them.
In the subsequent decade, the importance of quantitative aggregates
waned further. In practical policymaking, this reflected the rapid spread of
inflation targeting frameworks to an increasing number of countries, not least in
the emerging market world. In academia, the downgrading, if not outright
obsolescence, of quantitative aggregates reflected the development and rise to
benchmark status of new macroeconomic paradigms which effectively ignored
the role of money and credit altogether, focusing exclusively on interest rates
and measures of slack.

A recent revival?

Some empirical
evidence supports
this approach

The establishment of the ECB helped breathe new life into the debate about
the role of quantitative aggregates. From the start, the ECB chose to follow
developments in money closely, along the lines of the monetarist tradition
of the Bundesbank, making monetary analysis an important pillar in
assessing developments and conducting monetary policy. The formal adoption,
subsequent reaffirmation and consistent use of the two-pillar framework has
been very significant. Indeed, the ECB has consistently relied on its monetary
analysis as a means of cross-checking, from a medium-term perspective,
the signals of inflationary pressures that emerge from a more conventional
economic analysis focused on a shorter-term horizon. The Bank has also
conducted extensive research that has generated considerable empirical and
theoretical support for its approach.
The type of empirical evidence employed to support this perspective has,
until recently, very much focused on the money-inflation link stressed by
the quantity equation. A few examples can be noted. First, the existence of the
long-run link has been argued to survive the various changes in the economic
and financial environment (Graph IV.12). Second, horse races between

Table IV.1

measures of output gaps and money have sometimes found a complementary
role for monetary aggregates (as illustrated in Table IV.1), pointing to their
potential usefulness as additional information variables. Moreover, empirical
analysis has underlined how the information content of monetary aggregates
for inflation appears to rise, and that of measures of economic slack to fall, as the
horizon lengthens, supporting a cross-checking role at medium-term horizons.

Credit back from the wilderness
At the same time, in the early 2000s another perspective emphasising the role
of quantitative aggregates, and especially credit, began to emerge. This
perspective had distant roots in those theories of business fluctuations from the
early part of the 20th century which had stressed the self-reinforcing processes
that led to occasional booms and busts. It also borrowed from the intellectual
tradition that highlighted the role of credit and speculative behaviour as a
cause of financial instability. Finally, it retained elements of the more recent
advances in economic theory, which emphasised how credit imperfections
could amplify business cycles.
The backdrop for these evolving views was the observation of a number
of recent economic and financial booms that had ended in quite severe busts
with costly consequences. The Japanese downturn that had begun in the early
1990s was a dramatic example. The expansionary phase in this case was
characterised by rapid credit growth, rising asset prices and unusually high
levels of domestic capital formation, and, of particular significance, overt
inflation during the boom was not a problem at all, probably because of
favourable supply side developments (Graph IV.13).
Moreover, research increasingly revealed that these types of “credit
booms gone wrong” had been seen in other advanced industrial countries and

Policy implication

emerging market economies and in other time periods. While the performance
of inflation had not always been uniform across episodes, inflation had not
generally been a particularly worrisome consideration. Examples include
the banking crises in the Nordic countries in the late 1980s to early 1990s,
the Southeast Asian crisis of 1997–98 and, to a certain extent, aspects of the
business cycles in the United Kingdom and United States which had ended in
recessions during the early 1990s. Others looked back further in history to note
that the run-up to the Great Depression had exhibited similar non-inflationary
characteristics. This suggested that the economic mechanisms and human
behaviour which contributed to this type of cycle had persisted in the face
of major changes in the structure of economies, their level of openness and
regulatory regimes.
This perspective found some support in more formal statistical work which
indicated that real-time measures of the coexistence of unusually rapid credit
and asset price increases could help to provide information about financial
distress, output weakness and disinflation beyond the traditional one- to twoyear horizon normally used in policy frameworks. More generally, econometric
work began to find a significant role for quantitative aggregates, both money
and credit, in boom-bust economic fluctuations of this kind, with property prices
playing a key role.
The main policy implication of this perspective was that it might be
desirable for monetary policy frameworks to allow for the option to lean against
a perceived build-up of financial imbalances even if the near-term inflation
outlook is benign. This would act as a form of insurance, limiting the risk and
costs of a potentially disruptive unwinding of the imbalances further down the
road, either because they collapse under their own weight, or because delayed
inflationary pressures eventually emerge, forcing the central bank to tighten.
In fact, in the context of the low-inflation environment, the disinflationary
consequences of a bust could translate into deflation risks, along with the

BIS 77th Annual Report

77

complications arising from real debt burdens and the zero lower bound for
nominal policy rates. Operationally, a pre-emptive tightening would call for an
extension of policy horizons beyond the usual one to two years, thereby
allowing for a more structured assessment of tail risks to the outlook.

Factoring monetary and credit developments into policy decisions
Central banks have adopted various perspectives on the role of quantitative
aggregates in current policy frameworks.
Many central banks have found it hard to extract sufficiently reliable
information from monetary aggregates as indicators of inflation and, as a
consequence, have been reluctant to assign them a prominent role in
controlling it. The Federal Reserve and the bulk of inflation targeters fall into
this category. Some of these central banks, however, have begun to question
whether a benign neglect approach to the monetary aggregates is justified,
particularly in economies where the quantitative aggregates have been rising
fast. The Bank of England and, to a greater extent, the Swiss National Bank
are two such examples. By way of contrast, from its inception, the ECB has
consistently emphasised the role of monetary aggregates in cross-checking the
evidence from short-run determinants of inflation.
In recent years, the intellectual climate among central banks has become
somewhat more receptive to the perspective which highlights the potential role
of quantitative aggregates in signalling financial imbalances. For example, the
ECB has extended and nuanced the interpretation of the monetary analysis
pillar to reflect the role of credit and asset prices. Similarly, the second
(medium-term) perspective of the Bank of Japan’s new monetary policy
framework can accommodate these factors. And several inflation targeting
central banks now allow for the possibility of extending the normal policy
horizon in the light of the potential build-up of financial imbalances, as is
consistent with this perspective (eg the Bank of England, Sveriges Riksbank
and the Central Bank of Norway), or else have stressed the importance of a
medium-term horizon to start with, as in the case of the Reserve Bank of
Australia.
The years ahead are likely to see a further intensification of the debate
over the extent to which monetary and credit aggregates should be given
prominence in policy frameworks. Indeed, the current rapid expansion of these
aggregates in various parts of the world may lead some central banks to ask
soul-searching questions about the appropriate policy response. As noted
above, the stakes are high. Attaching too much weight to the aggregates runs
the risk of overreaction and of possibly confusing the public concerning central
bank strategies and priorities, especially in economies where near-term
inflation pressures remain subdued. Discounting their signals runs the risk of
reacting too little and too late. Either way, ultimately, the credibility of central
banks lies in the balance.

Highlights
Over most of 2006 and the first four months of 2007, the US dollar depreciated
gradually on a nominal trade-weighted basis while the euro appreciated. The
yen depreciated to a greater extent than the US dollar. Many other European
currencies, including the Czech koruna, the Swedish krona and sterling, also
appreciated over 2006, both in trade-weighted terms and against the euro, but
have weakened somewhat since. The main exception has been the Swiss
franc, which broadly depreciated throughout the period under review. Some
currencies in the Asian region, most notably the Thai baht, appreciated in
trade-weighted terms. The appreciation of the renminbi against the US dollar
picked up pace in the second half of 2006, but was considerably more
moderate when measured in trade-weighted terms.
Overall, foreign exchange markets were characterised by high levels of
trading activity and historically low volatility. There were, however, two
episodes of higher volatility. The first was in May and June 2006: in this
episode, the most significant consequences were generally felt by emerging
market currencies, such as the Brazilian real, and the currencies of countries
experiencing a combination of high interest rates and large current account
deficits, such as the Australian and New Zealand dollars. The second episode
started at the end of February 2007: a broad range of currencies experienced
an increase in volatility, which began to recede in mid-March.
Three main factors influenced exchange rate developments during the
period under review. First, reflecting the macroeconomic outlook and its
implications for monetary policy, interest rate differentials continued to affect
movements in a number of currency pairs. Against the background of low
exchange rate volatility, the continuing build-up of carry trades was an
important mechanism through which interest rate differentials played a role.
Second, consistent with a trend that started in the late 1990s, the accumulation
of official foreign exchange reserves increased significantly in 2006, limiting the
effects of upward pressure on currencies in the Asian region and in a number
of oil-exporting countries. In some cases, notably China, Korea, Malaysia and
Thailand, changes in capital controls were also introduced with a view to
easing this upward pressure. Third, global imbalances remained a feature of
the environment in which exchange rates were being determined. Large fiscal
or current account deficits may have affected the extent to which some
currencies responded to episodes of increased volatility across financial
markets. At the same time, the US current account deficit seemed to attract
less attention from market participants as an explanation of developments in
the US dollar than in previous periods.

The final section of this chapter explores some trends in reserve
management practices which potentially have significant implications for
financial markets, including foreign exchange markets. A number of factors
underlying these trends are discussed, including the large accumulation of
reserves by some countries, advances in financial technology and the
development of financial markets, and changes in the external governance
environment in which central banks operate. The section then discusses some
of the challenges posed by these changes.

Developments in foreign exchange markets
Over 2006 and the first four months of 2007, most currencies followed broadly
unbroken trends. However, there was evidence of a distinct break in the
prevailing trend for some currencies at the beginning of 2007.
In 2006 and the first four months of 2007, the US dollar broadly
depreciated, falling almost 6% in nominal effective terms. Against the euro, it
depreciated by around 15%, losing most of the ground it had gained over the
course of 2005 (Graph V.1). During 2006, the US dollar also depreciated
against several other European currencies (most notably sterling), the
Australian dollar and the currencies of a number of emerging economies in
Asia. In contrast, following a sharp depreciation in May 2006, the US dollar
appreciated against the yen over the remainder of the year. In general, there
appears to have been a break around the beginning of 2007 in the behaviour of
US dollar exchange rates: in some cases the earlier trend appears to have
reversed, while in others the US dollar appears to have stabilised somewhat.
European currencies generally appreciated in nominal effective terms
over 2006. The euro gained almost 5%; the Czech koruna, the Swedish krona
and sterling also posted strong gains (Graph V.2). In addition, the Hungarian

early 2007, some of these trends reversed. The Swiss franc was a notable
exception, as it remained relatively stable in nominal effective terms in
the first half of 2006 but depreciated over the remainder of the period
under review.
Currencies in the Asian region followed divergent paths and tended to
move less synchronously against the US dollar and in effective terms than in
previous years. The yen depreciated in nominal effective terms over 2006 and
into 2007, as did the Hong Kong and New Taiwan dollars, although the yen
appreciated somewhat in May 2006 and March 2007. In contrast, the Philippine
peso and the Thai baht appreciated significantly (Graph V.3). Although the
Korean won did not appreciate to the same extent as some other Asian
currencies in 2006, it remained at a high level following an appreciation of

15% in nominal effective terms over the previous 18 months. In the first four
months of 2007, however, the won depreciated by a little over 1%. The pace of
appreciation of the renminbi against the US dollar roughly doubled between
the first half of 2006 and the period end-June 2006 to end-February 2007, to
an annualised rate of almost 5%, but was more muted in trade-weighted
terms. In March and April 2007, the renminbi was broadly stable against the
US dollar, but depreciated by over 1% in trade-weighted terms.

Exchange rate levels from a longer-term perspective
One way of assessing the prevailing levels of exchange rates in a longerterm context is to compare real effective exchange rates with their long-term
averages. Over the period under review, the position of most currencies
against this benchmark did not change substantially. On average over the first
four months of 2007, the real effective exchange rates of the US dollar and
euro were within 7% of their long-run averages (Graph V.4). Several currencies
in Asia, most notably the New Taiwan dollar and the yen, were more than 10%
below. The same was true for the Swedish krona. At the other end of the
spectrum, the New Zealand dollar and sterling were significantly higher.

Conditions in foreign exchange markets
Overall, foreign exchange markets were characterised by high levels of
turnover and historically low volatility, consistent with a broad downward trend
in volatility across all financial markets (Graph V.5; see also Chapter VI). There
were two episodes of higher volatility in foreign exchange markets, which also
coincided with more general increases across financial markets. The increase
in volatility during these episodes was, however, modest in size and not
widespread.
During the first episode in May and June 2006, both implied and realised
volatility in the yen/dollar and yen/euro markets picked up briefly. Volatility
displayed a particularly pronounced spike for some emerging market
currencies, such as the Brazilian real and the South African rand, and
increased, though to a lesser extent, for currencies of countries with high

interest rates and large current account deficits, such as the Australian and
New Zealand dollars. The prevailing trends of exchange rate appreciation
were interrupted temporarily. The second episode occurred in late February
and early March 2007. The volatility of a number of currency pairs rose as
volatility again picked up markedly across financial markets more generally,
and foreign exchange market turnover increased.

Determinants of exchange rate movements
There have been three main drivers of exchange rate developments over the
past year or so: the macroeconomic outlook, with its implications for monetary
policy and interest rate differentials; exchange rate policies and associated
intervention, particularly in emerging market countries in Asia; and global
external imbalances. In addition, commodity price movements have influenced
the dynamics of specific currencies.

Interest rate differentials and the role of carry trades
Interest rate
differentials were
an important driver
of exchange rate
movements

As in previous years, changes in actual and expected interest rate differentials
reflecting market participants’ assessment of macroeconomic conditions and
their implications for monetary policy appear to have had a major influence
on exchange rate movements. The behaviour of the dollar/euro rate is an
important example. Evidence from implied forward rates, derived from interest
rate forward contracts, suggests that markets expected the ECB to continue
normalising interest rates throughout the period under review but considered
the Federal Reserve to be close to the peak of its tightening cycle (Graph V.1).
This is consistent with the trend appreciation of the euro against the dollar over
2006 and early 2007.

In addition, low volatility and large interest rate differentials underpinned
significant cross-currency flows in the form of carry trades. Conventionally, the
label “carry trade” is used to describe speculative activities by financial players
such as hedge funds and commodity trading advisers. These trades involve
simultaneously going short the funding currency and long the target currency,
typically through the derivatives market. They are profitable as long as
the gains from interest rate differentials are not offset by exchange rate
movements. Consequently, they are sensitive to increases in exchange
rate volatility or sudden changes in interest rate expectations. The investors
involved are often highly leveraged, and could be forced to unwind positions
very quickly in response to changing market conditions. This might have a
large impact on exchange rates, especially in smaller markets. The sudden
collapse of the dollar against the yen in October 1998 suggests that even
large market segments can be affected by a sudden unwinding of carry
trade positions.
In order to assess the role of carry trades, it is useful to distinguish them
from two other types of cross-currency flows that present some similarities.
One such flow is generated by domestic retail investors purchasing
higher-yielding assets denominated in foreign currency. An example that has
attracted much attention is the purchase of foreign currency bonds by retail
investors in Japan, which has arguably been supported by a growing tolerance
for risk accompanying faster domestic output growth. Given that Japanese
retail investors hold the bulk of their wealth in yen, they are not as sensitive to
the risk of a sudden rise in the value of the yen as leveraged investors who
short the currency. They are therefore less likely to unwind their foreign
currency investments during episodes of exchange rate volatility. Indeed,
market commentary suggests that Japanese retail investors took advantage of
the yen appreciation associated with the most recent rise in volatility to
increase their exposure to high-yielding overseas assets. However, even

changes in these exposures can potentially have a significant impact on
exchange rates, if they occur on a sufficiently large scale.
Indirect evidence suggests that, over the period under review, retail
investors’ purchases of foreign currency assets were substantial. Data on foreign
currency bonds purchased by Japanese individual investors reveal ongoing
outflows from Japanese yen to high-yielding currencies over 2006, particularly
to the Australian and New Zealand dollars (Graph V.6). Market reports pointed
to official but informal estimates for Japan suggesting that Japanese retail
investors’ exposure to foreign securities could be around $150 billion.
A second cross-currency flow with similarities to the carry trade involves
residents of a high interest rate country borrowing in a low-yielding currency to
purchase domestic assets. Market commentary over the period under review
focused on households in central and eastern Europe funding mortgages in
euros and Swiss francs. The resulting currency mismatches can make the
domestic currency vulnerable if they are large enough, as the Asian crisis of
1997–98 highlighted. However, the available evidence suggests that these
investments are not that large and, unlike leveraged carry trade activity, are not
likely to be unwound quickly. Moreover, most lending in central and eastern
Europe is, in any event, carried out by banks from western Europe with
diversified exposures.

During the period under review, market commentary pointed to the yen
and Swiss franc as the main funding currencies for carry trades, and the
Australian and New Zealand dollars, sterling and some emerging market
currencies – including the Brazilian real, Hungarian forint and South African rand
– as the main target currencies. Carry trades arguably supported appreciating
trends of the target currencies. In May–June 2006 and February 2007, however,
an unwinding of these strategies might have contributed to the weakening of
the target currencies and the strengthening of the funding ones (Table V.1).
Given that the increase in volatility was fairly modest and short-lived, this
effect was small and temporary, and did not spread to other currency markets.
Measures designed to capture the ex ante or ex post performance of carry
trades highlight that, for most of 2006 and early 2007, these strategies were
generally profitable on a risk-adjusted basis. Carry-to-risk ratios, for example,
which measure interest rate differentials adjusted for the expected risks implied by
currency options, suggest that carry trades funded by the yen were particularly
attractive in 2006, benefiting from sustained interest rate differentials and low
exchange rate volatility (Graph V.7). Profitability fell in May–June 2006 and
February 2007, however, in reaction to a rise in the perceived risk of carry
trades during periods of heightened financial market volatility.
Estimating the size of carry trades and assessing their impact on
exchange rates is notoriously difficult. In the absence of publicly available data
on positions in foreign exchange markets, several alternative indirect measures
are typically used. These include: data on the open interest of speculators in
currency futures; different variables capturing trading activity in foreign
exchange markets; style analysis of hedge fund returns; and the BIS
international banking statistics. Overall, when matched with measures of carry

trade profitability, they all suggest that these strategies could have played a
significant role in exchange rate developments during the period under review.
A widely used measure is derived from data on open positions in foreign
exchange futures traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. These
distinguish between commercial and non-commercial (speculative) traders, as
well as long and short positions. Data on net non-commercial open interest –
particularly net short open interest in the yen and net long open interest in
sterling and the Australian dollar – are consistent with carry trade volumes
rising sharply in 2005 and 2006 but falling at the end of February 2007, at a
time when exchange rate volatility increased (Graph V.6). There is less
evidence of an increase in speculative net short positions in the Swiss franc in
the course of 2006. At the same time, these conclusions should be treated with
caution for a number of reasons. First, data from the BIS Triennial Central
Bank Survey of Foreign Exchange and Derivatives Market Activity suggest that
only a small fraction of foreign exchange trading goes through futures
markets. Second, the classification of currency trades into commercial and
non-commercial is somewhat arbitrary. Third, some of the trades identified as
speculative might not result from carry trades.
Data on turnover in foreign exchange markets support the conclusions
derived from an analysis of futures markets. The strong growth in foreign
exchange turnover in the Australian and New Zealand dollars, as well as a
number of emerging market currencies, is consistent with the growth of carry
trade activity targeting these currencies over the course of 2006 (Graph V.7).
The high levels of aggregate turnover following a sharp contraction in the carryto-risk ratios appear to be a reflection of the unwinding of carry trades in
response to a rise in exchange rate volatility. At the same time, these turnover
data can provide only indirect evidence since they do not identify the nature
of the trades or the counterparties involved. OTC derivatives market surveys
conducted semiannually, which suffer similar limitations, also provide some
evidence on the rising activity in several carry trade target currencies, as well
as funding currencies such as the yen and Swiss franc.
An alternative approach to assessing the role of carry trades, based on a
style analysis of a large set of hedge fund returns, also broadly confirms the
importance of carry trade strategies for a number of currencies. Style analysis
is based on regressions of returns from a panel of hedge funds on measures of
the payoffs from specific carry trade strategies, controlling for the performance
of broad market indices. Applying this technique to the past two years of data
for a few hundred hedge funds helps to assess whether returns were sensitive
to such payoffs. The results indicate that carry trade strategies involving
currencies such as the Australian dollar or the Brazilian real have some
statistically significant, albeit modest, explanatory power for the performance
of different types of hedge funds. While this style analysis may be useful in
highlighting the broad significance of carry trade strategies for hedge funds
in the medium term, it is difficult to infer with any precision what happened
to these investments during episodes of heightened volatility.
BIS international banking statistics provide more mixed evidence on the
importance of carry trades. These statistics can be useful to the extent that

BIS 77th Annual Report

carry trades are implemented, at least in part, through outright borrowing and
lending. A change in claims on residents in financial centres as opposed to
other locations could be interpreted as indicating a change in carry trade
activity, given that many hedge funds or proprietary trading desks are located
in those centres. These data actually show a fall in the stock of outstanding
yen-denominated claims in 2006, including a drop in credit to residents of the
United Kingdom and offshore centres. This finding seems consistent with a
decline in carry trade activity involving the yen as funding currency. By contrast,
Swiss franc claims grew in the first half of 2006, suggesting an increasing role
of the franc as a funding currency, although claims on borrowers in the United
Kingdom and offshore financial centres remained relatively small. These
results also have to be interpreted with caution, since global claim flows
respond to a variety of influences other than carry trade activity.

Exchange rate policy
As in previous years, a sizeable accumulation of foreign exchange reserves
indicates that intervention was an important factor in foreign exchange markets
in 2006. Official foreign exchange reserves held by monetary authorities increased
by around $850 billion, double the amount recorded in 2005 (Table V.2). The
accumulation mainly, but not entirely, reflected intervention in foreign exchange
markets in response to upward pressure on exchange rates due to strong inflows
into domestic capital markets, often combined with large current account surpluses.
Valuation effects arising from significant exchange rate movements together
with income flows are also likely to have boosted reserves measured in US dollars.
In addition to the growth in official foreign exchange reserves on central
banks’ balance sheets, there has been significant growth in the foreign
exchange reserves managed by sovereign wealth funds. In some cases, these
funds have been set up to neutralise the effects of volatile commodity prices
on the domestic economy, and have therefore increased with high and rising
commodity prices. For example, the Government Pension Fund in Norway,
which is one of the most transparent sovereign wealth funds, has tripled in
size since 2002 with the increase in oil prices. Other sovereign wealth funds
are an alternative destination for current account surpluses in economies with
managed exchange rates. The ongoing accumulation of official reserves, and
the recent announcement that some of China’s official foreign reserves would
be used to create a separate investment-oriented fund, suggest that reserves
managed by sovereign wealth funds will grow further.
China continued to show the largest accumulation of foreign exchange
reserves in absolute terms, despite moving to a more flexible exchange rate
regime in 2005. Russia registered the second largest increase, double that of
2005. Brazil and India also recorded large increases in foreign exchange
reserve accumulation, mainly as a result of exchange rate intervention.
Foreign exchange intervention was not sufficient to offset upward pressure
on exchange rates in a number of Asian countries, with the result that some
exchange rates still appreciated significantly (Graph V.3). In many cases,
including China, India, Korea, Malaysia and the Philippines, intervention was
supplemented by a liberalisation of capital outflows. For example, Korea eased

restrictions on overseas investment and provided incentives to invest in foreign
securities and real estate assets. In China, further measures to encourage
capital outflows included raising limits on corporate and individual purchases of
foreign currency, allowing banks and insurance companies to invest in offshore
fixed income assets, and permitting qualified managers to accumulate foreign
currency funds and invest offshore. In contrast, to meet the same objective, the
Bank of Thailand increased controls on capital inflows, following several other
attempts to curb the appreciation of the baht (see Chapter III).
In addition to the rapid accumulation of reserves, changes in their
currency composition and their potential impact on exchange rates also
received some attention. However, it is hard to detect any firm evidence for
them having any effect. There were several announcements about actual or

BIS 77th Annual Report

89

possible changes in the currency denomination of foreign exchange reserves
throughout 2006. They mostly pointed to a switch towards euro- and
sterling-denominated reserves and out of the US dollar. To the extent that
these announcements had an effect on exchange rates, it was short-lived,
possibly because the size of the reserves involved was generally not large.
This explanation is supported by aggregate data from the IMF. While partial,
these data indicate that the shares of official foreign exchange reserves
denominated in US dollars and euros remained more or less stable between
2005 and 2006, at two thirds and one quarter of the total, respectively. The
only trend change in composition of any significance has been an increase in
the share of sterling and a decline in the share of the yen. It should be noted,
however, that the currency composition of reserves is not available for all
countries, most importantly China, which limits the usefulness of these
statistics. In addition, these data do not cover sovereign wealth funds, and little
is known about the currency composition of their assets.

Global imbalances
The trends in global current account imbalances stabilised somewhat over
2006, but there were no strong indications that they would reverse substantially
in the near future (see Chapter II). While the US current account deficit
widened further over the course of 2006, it narrowed marginally in early 2007
relative to GDP. Overall, the current account surplus for the Asian region
edged up relative to GDP, while the surpluses in net oil-exporting countries
stabilised as oil prices fell in the second half of 2006. The region that
experienced the most pronounced deterioration in its current account position
was central and eastern Europe.
External imbalances did not appear to have a first-order effect on G3
exchange rate movements. While it could be argued that the trend depreciation
of the US dollar reflects markets’ underlying concern about the large US
current account deficit, the substantial depreciation of the yen is not consistent
with the Japanese current account position. This suggests that interest
differentials have been more important than longer-term considerations over
the period under review, as discussed above.
Large current account deficits did appear to make the currencies of some
smaller economies vulnerable to an increase in risk aversion, particularly
during the episode of volatility in May and June 2006. At the same time, there
is a strong negative correlation between the ratios of current account balances
to GDP and the levels of domestic interest rates (Table V.1). In particular, a
number of carry trade target economies have large current account deficits.
Regressions of exchange rate volatility on both these factors over the past six
years indicate that interest rates have been more important. If so, this could
suggest that vulnerability to a reversal of speculative flows, rather than
structural imbalances, has been more relevant over the period under review.
Whether recent experience is a reliable guide to what may happen to
exchange rates if external imbalances persist is an open question. Financial
market volatility has been very low by historical standards: even in episodes where
volatility has increased, the peaks have been modest. This suggests the possibility

Exchange rates of

exporters followed

Over the period under review, the exchange rates of commodity-exporting
countries in nearly all cases reflected developments in the relevant commodity
prices, which were less synchronised than they had been in the recent past. The
exchange rates of energy exporters such as Canada and Norway closely mirrored
developments in crude oil prices, appreciating in the first half of 2006 and
depreciating in the second (Graph V.8). Both countries’ currencies appreciated
again over the first four months of 2007, following the recovery of oil prices. The
exchange rates of a number of other commodity exporters depreciated following
the dip in most non-oil commodity prices during the market turbulence of May 2006.
However, the exchange rates of diversified commodity exporters such as Australia
and Brazil recovered relatively quickly. Moreover, they remained around
historically high levels as the confluence of tightness of supply and strong demand
conditions led many commodity prices to rebound, in some cases to new peaks.
The Russian rouble benefited both from the strength of oil prices in the first half
of 2006 and from Russia being a diversified commodity exporter in the second.

Reserve accumulation and reserve management practices
Changes in reserve
management
practices potentially
affect financial
markets …

The size and concentration of official foreign exchange reserves after years of
continued expansion, especially since the Asian crisis, have led to renewed
interest in the way reserve management decisions are taken and in their
possible impact on financial markets. For example, a heated debate has been

BIS 77th Annual Report

91

taking place surrounding the effect of official purchases of US dollar debt in
holding down US government bond yields (see Chapter VI). Looking forward,
questions can also be asked about the possible market implications of any
further significant changes in the asset composition of reserves, perhaps as
part of broader efforts to increase returns.
Foreign exchange reserve management practices have evolved
substantially over the past decade or so, reflecting changes in both the
economic and the broader institutional environment. These changes have
affected the foreign exchange reserve management practices of a wide range
of central banks, the entities primarily charged with performing this function,
well beyond those managing the largest portfolios of official reserves. While
some of these changes have been remarked upon, others have attracted less
attention.
Against this background, this section documents some of the main
changes in foreign exchange reserve management practices, considers the
main drivers behind them and explores some of the challenges ahead, with a
particular eye to those that could have a more significant impact on financial
markets. For present purposes, the reasons for the accumulation of net
reserves are taken as given, as they relate to broader policy decisions.

… and have
evolved significantly
in recent years

Main trends in foreign exchange reserve management
When considering the evolution of reserve management practices, at least
three trends deserve particular attention. Similarly to what has happened for
monetary and supervisory policy, these trends pertain to the objectives,
instruments and accountability of central banks. While admittedly varying
across economies in terms of intensity and timing, their incidence has been
quite general. The trends are: an increased focus on returns; the adoption of
a more structured approach, underpinned by a strengthening of internal
governance and risk management; and a greater degree of public disclosure.
The increased focus on returns has perhaps been the most visible trend,
and has been manifested in a variety of ways. In some cases, separate
sovereign wealth funds with a stronger mandate to focus on returns have been
created. In a number of central banks, existing reserves have been subdivided
into separate tranches, such as a liquidity and an investment portfolio, or
mandated to external managers so as to permit a more specialised type
of management. More generally, central banks have broadened the range of
instruments they invest in to include assets, such as “spread products”, which
promise a yield pickup over more traditional ones, either because of their
liquidity characteristics or due to lower credit quality.
The more structured approach to reserve management decisions has
taken three highly complementary forms. They relate to the degree of vertical
tiering and horizontal separation in the management processes and to the
supporting risk management functions.
The first way of imposing structure has been the adoption of a more topdown, vertically-tiered framework to ensure the appropriate design of the
portfolio and its effective implementation. At the strategic level, much effort
has been devoted to determining the appropriate risk-return trade-off for the

portfolio (“strategic asset allocation”). This has been seen as part of a broader
decision about the acceptable risk-return trade-off for the institution in the light
of the other functions it performs (see below). In most central banks, the
definition of this strategic trade-off has formally become the responsibility of
the executive level. The decision is then articulated by selecting a benchmark
portfolio and defining the tolerance ranges within which the actual allocation is
allowed to vary. In many central banks, a tactical asset allocation layer has
been introduced between the strategic asset allocation and the portfolio
managers’ position-taking, with a view to centralising decisions aimed at taking
advantage of shorter-term market developments.
The second way has been to introduce a greater degree of horizontal
separation in the organisation of the activities involved in reserve management.
The objective has been to strengthen the integrity of the process, not least by
limiting potential internal conflicts of interest. In particular, different activities,
such as asset management, performance measurement, compliance with
investment guidelines and settlement functions, have generally become more
segregated, in terms of both their functional organisation and their reporting
lines.
The third way has been to strengthen risk management processes. This
has been seen as a necessary step to support an expansion in the investable
universe and to implement a more disciplined approach to investing. As
regards financial risks, a greater use of risk measurement and management
tools has helped to design the benchmark portfolio, measure and evaluate
performance, limit execution risks and ensure compliance. There has also been
a trend towards greater centralisation in the management of operational risk,
while its prominence within the organisation has been raised by assigning
responsibility for it to higher management levels.
A greater degree of external disclosure has affected several aspects
of foreign exchange reserve management activities. An increasing number of
central banks are now publishing more information about the institutional
framework, the assets in the investable universe and performance. Some
central banks also report on the currency composition of their reserves,
although those that have done so have not generally held sizeable shares of
world reserves. The main exception is Russia’s central bank.

Main factors behind the trends
Three main driving
forces:

the large
accumulation of
foreign exchange
reserves …

The trends in central bank foreign exchange reserve management identified
above have been underpinned by several key developments in the economic
and institutional environment. The most important among these are: the large
accumulation of reserves by some countries; advances in financial technology
and the development of financial markets; and changes in the external
governance environment within which central banks operate.
The large accumulation of foreign exchange reserves in several countries
in recent years has naturally shifted the balance towards more return-oriented
strategies while at the same time putting a premium on the processes
necessary to manage an increasingly large fraction of an economy’s resources.
While measuring the “adequacy” of reserves with any precision is quite hard,

BIS 77th Annual Report

93

in several economies the stock of reserves does appear to be well above
standard measures of adequacy based on liquidity considerations alone
(Table V.3). This has especially been the case in economies where the main
factor driving reserve accumulation has ceased to be a conscious effort to
build up a war chest, but has rather become a by-product of attempts to lean
against the appreciation of the domestic currency.
Advances in financial technology and the development of financial
markets have been important, more general factors behind the main trends
in reserve management practices. Much as in the private sector, advances in
financial technology have provided central banks with the tools necessary for
a more structured approach to risk measurement and management and,
arguably, have also helped to reduce the need for pure liquidity balances. The
development of financial markets has increased the range of assets that
provide an acceptable level of liquidity while offering more attractive yields,
such as various mortgage-backed securities. Financial markets have also
improved the capacity of central banks to obtain funds at short notice by
posting collateral. Increasingly, central banks have also begun to use derivative
products to support their investment decisions. Prospectively, derivatives
markets could also support a further broadening of the investable universe. For
example, the emergence of deep markets for credit default swaps could allow
central banks to manage more effectively the risks associated with entry into
corporate bond markets.
Finally, the impact of changes in the external governance environment
has been far-reaching and multifaceted, helping to explain the cross-country
breadth of the observed trends. In particular, the global shift towards greater

central bank independence has increased the emphasis on accountability and
transparency. This has been one of the factors motivating a greater degree of
external disclosure in reserve management and a strengthening of internal
governance processes. In some countries, it has also added pressure to obtain
higher returns on reserves. At the same time, there has been more focus on
the importance of reputation and credibility for effective policymaking. This has
heightened the sensitivity of central banks to the need for sound investment
processes, in terms of both the effectiveness and security of the operations,
and the management of the potential conflicts of interest involved. The role of
many central banks as regulators and standard setters for the private sector,
and hence their need to lead by example, has merely added to such incentives.

Challenges
How challenges
are addressed can
affect financial
markets

How should the
numeraire currency
be chosen?

How reserves are
assumed to be
used matters in
this choice

The major trends in reserve management just identified have presented central
banks with significant challenges. While some of these challenges have
implications that are largely confined to the internal organisation and running
of the institution, others can have more immediate implications for financial
markets and exchange rates. To illustrate this second point, it is worth
exploring in more detail three issues: the choice of “numeraire” for the design
of the portfolio; the definition of the appropriate risk-return trade-off for the
reserves; and the appropriate degree of public disclosure. In none of these
areas is there a one-size-fits-all solution or, indeed, any such thing as a
“correct” answer. Rather, difficult trade-offs need to be struck between
competing considerations. Even so, the way in which these issues are resolved
can have potentially significant implications.
At a strategic level, the choice of the numeraire currency, or basket of
currencies, underlying portfolio allocation decisions – which may differ from
that used for public accounting purposes – is particularly influential for the
currency composition of reserves. If it is assumed that expected returns are
equalised across currencies over the long term – a common assumption when
deciding on the strategic asset allocation – the choice of numeraire influences
the currency composition of the benchmark portfolio primarily through its
impact on the measured variability of returns. Specifically, the currency
composition of reserves will be heavily tilted towards currencies with higher
covariance vis-à-vis the numeraire. The adoption of a more structured and formal
approach to reserve management and the availability of more sophisticated
financial tools have recently highlighted the importance of this choice.
In principle, the choice of numeraire presupposes a careful analysis of the
intended uses of the reserves and of the broader institutional environment
which helps to define the risk tolerance of the reserve holder. Traditionally,
when reserves were held primarily for intervention purposes, an obvious
candidate for (the largely implicit) numeraire was the most liquid currency
used for interventions, notably the US dollar. Similarly, when capital account
transactions were less important than today, the currency denomination of
imports presented a natural alternative choice of numeraire. Subsequently, in
cases where reserves came to be seen primarily as a hedge for external liabilities,
the currency composition of those liabilities could have gained relevance.

BIS 77th Annual Report

95

More recently, two trends suggest that the domestic currency might be
becoming increasingly attractive as the numeraire. First, especially in countries
where reserves exceed liquidity needs and the investment motive dominates,
the domestic currency might be seen as a better guide to whether portfolio
wealth is being maximised or not. In addition, central banks may have become
more sensitive to losses, insofar as they are perceived as possibly undermining
their reputation and operational independence (see below), not least by
eroding their capital base. If so, this would tend to increase the relevance
of the exchange rate regime in influencing the currency allocation, tilting
it towards the currency, or basket, against which the domestic currency is
more stable.
The specification of the appropriate risk-return trade-off for the reserve
holder is a particularly challenging task. It would be challenging if the
reserve management function were considered in isolation; it is even more so
when considered as part of the package of functions performed by central banks.
The way in which this issue is resolved has implications for the breadth of the
investable asset universe and for the degree and nature of active management.
While the shift towards a greater investment orientation in the
management of reserves has naturally promoted a more return-oriented
approach, there are no obvious criteria for establishing what the right balance
between risk and return should be. In part, this reflects difficulties in estimating
the true opportunity cost of the funds. For example, in a proximate sense, all
reserves are “borrowed”, be it in domestic or foreign currency, and so the
immediate financing cost is easily measured. However, an assessment of the true
opportunity cost to the economy cannot shy away from general equilibrium
considerations, involving a view about the counterfactual configuration of
exchange and interest rates in the absence of reserve accumulation. This, in
turn, would naturally depend on the alternative uses to which reserves could be
put, such as infrastructure investments or reductions in taxation.
The bundling of foreign reserve management with other functions
complicates matters further. Central banks, in particular, because of their
heightened sensitivity to reputational risk, are generally also highly sensitive to
the credit and operational risks associated with investment activities, arguably
well beyond their direct impact on portfolio returns. And, as reserves grow
relative to the overall central bank balance sheet, concerns about losses could
paradoxically increase, and hence risk tolerance decline, reflecting the greater
potential for a large, negative impact on the institution’s capital. The desire to
avoid such outcomes can also have implications for the “location” of the
reserve management function within the public sector. For example, these
considerations provide one reason why special investment funds, not on the
central bank’s balance sheet, have been established in some economies
judged to have reserves in excess of liquidity needs. At the same time, the
experience of Norway suggests that some of these constraints on risk
preferences are highly dependent on the specific institutional environment
within which the central bank operates. There, the central bank manages its
own reserves as well as the Government Pension Fund along broadly similar
lines.

More generally, questions can be asked about how far a more returnoriented approach should be pushed in the first place. In an increasingly global
marketplace, the shared responsibilities of public authorities for public goods
such as well functioning markets and financial stability set limits on this
orientation. For example, when responding to individual incentives, it is only
natural for private sector agents to engage in a search for yield or, at times of
turmoil, to retrench and withdraw from markets. But, in the aggregate, such
behaviour, if taken too far, can contribute to financial instability.
Despite the trend towards increased transparency, considerable
controversy surrounds the question of the appropriate degree of public
disclosure of information on foreign reserves. In the past, much of the
discussion about disclosure was concerned with the overall level of reserves
and the intervention that results in changes to that stock, not its composition.
However, as reserves have grown, attention has switched to their composition
and the implications that changes in it could have for financial markets. This is
information that central banks have traditionally been less inclined to provide.
External governance arrangements aside, and at the risk of some
oversimplification, the optimal degree of disclosure has been seen as involving
a trade-off between the efficiency-enhancing effects of providing additional
information to financial markets on the one hand, and the loss of tactical room
for manoeuvre for the reserve manager on the other. Differences of opinion,
therefore, hinge on differences in perspective on how well markets function and
on how far disclosure actually constrains the authorities’ ability to pursue their
objectives.
Factors that could reduce the willingness of reserve managers to be
transparent include the size of the reserves and the nature of the exchange
rate regime. If foreign exchange reserves are very large (Table V.3), then the
assumption that the central bank is an atomistic player in foreign exchange
markets and in the instruments it invests in is less likely to hold. Tactical
considerations could play an even bigger role if information about changes in
the currency composition of the reserves were interpreted as foreshadowing
changes in a managed exchange rate regime. Information on currency
composition could also reveal information on intervention activities by helping
to identify, ex post, changes in the level of reserves due to valuation effects.
More generally, changes in the currency composition of reserves technically
amount to sterilised intervention on the part of the authorities whose currencies
are being exchanged, and views about the impact of such transactions on
exchange rates diverge considerably.

VI. Financial markets

Highlights
Prices of risky assets continued to rise throughout most of 2006 and early
2007. Two sharp sell-offs during the period proved to be short-lived corrections
to the rally rather than prolonged downturns. As a result, a number of equity
markets reached historical highs, while various credit spreads touched new
lows. This occurred despite indications that global growth might have peaked,
and as the weaker economic outlook in the United States and the effects of
past interest hikes started to weigh on investor sentiment.
In this environment, bond yields in the advanced industrial economies
levelled off around mid-2006 and then began to edge downwards. The United
States, in particular, saw long-term bond yields falling during the second half
of the year, reflecting investor concerns about US growth prospects and
expectations that monetary policy would be easing. The economic outlook for
Japan remained more positive, lending some support to bond yields, while
the outlook for the euro area brightened progressively, and eventually brought
about rising euro bond yields.
While declining bond yields may have supported equities at times during
the period under review, a more important ingredient was continued strong
earnings growth. Moreover, ongoing changes in capital structure boosted
equity markets, as share buybacks rose further while merger and acquisition
activity grew substantially. Adding to this, high and rising risk appetite among
investors underpinned the rally in equities.
A combination of improving economic performance and a growing
willingness among investors to take on risk also impacted favourably on
corporate credit spreads in developed markets. Healthy corporate profits and low
leverage pushed down the market’s assessment of the likelihood of default to
very low levels. Similarly, gains in emerging markets coincided with improved
credit ratings and generally strong macroeconomic conditions. However, as in
other markets, increasing risk appetite probably helped fuel the downward trend
in spreads, both in developed corporate markets and in emerging markets.

Diverging growth prospects swayed yields
A gradual rise in long-term yields that had been under way in developed
country government bond markets for some time came to an end in May 2006,
when global financial markets suffered a sell-off. While prices of risky assets
began recovering soon thereafter, bond yields did not regain their upward
momentum. Instead, G3 long-term yields began to fall around mid-2006, as
investors revised downwards their outlook for economic growth, particularly
for the United States (Graph VI.1). Market expectations of policy rate cuts by
the Federal Reserve, evident during much of the period, contributed to this

decline. While the growth outlook was somewhat more upbeat in Japan, this
generated little upward pressure on Japanese bond yields, although it probably
limited the declines. In the euro area, the positive economic momentum gathered
pace progressively, eventually resulting in rising bond yields. Between early
May 2006 – ie before the sell-off – and 18 May 2007, 10-year US government
bond yields fell by around 35 basis points to 4.80%, while corresponding euro
area yields rose by some 30 basis points to around 4.30% and those in Japan
declined by close to 25 basis points to 1.65%.

… while rates rose
in Japan and the

The US Federal Reserve’s 17th consecutive rate hike on 29 June 2006 was
followed by a prolonged wait-and-see period, during which shifts in investors’
expectations of future policy moves contributed to declining yields at both long
and short maturities. While at first investors expected further tightening, albeit
at a slower pace, they gradually shifted towards the view that the Federal
Reserve would remain on hold for an extended period of time, and eventually
to anticipations of possible cuts in policy interest rates. At the time of the June
2006 rate hike, the difference between 10-year and two-year US yields stood
at close to nil. By 18 May 2007, the slope of the two- to 10-year segment of
the yield curve was little changed compared to the June 2006 levels, while
the short end of the US implied forward interest rate curve had inverted
considerably (Graph VI.2). This was in line with expectations of an easing of
US monetary policy over the near to medium term.
While rates were kept unchanged in the United States, continued
tightening of monetary policy in Japan and the euro area brought flattening
yield curves in these economies (Graph VI.2). Japan saw the end of the zero
interest rate environment and its first rate hike in six years in July 2006; this
was followed by another rate increase in February 2007. The ECB raised key
interest rates by 25 basis points five times between June 2006 and May 2007
(see Chapter IV). Meanwhile, long-term bond yields fell somewhat in Japan
and rose only moderately in the euro area, resulting in reduced term structure
slopes. Between early May 2006 and 18 May 2007, the difference between

10-year and two-year bond yields fell by around 55 basis points in the euro
area, and by about 45 basis points in Japan.

Diverging growth prospects and moderating inflation expectations
As always, decisions on policy rates reflected evolving assessments of
macroeconomic conditions and the outlook for the future, which also largely
shaped developments in long-term bond yields. Arguably, the most important
factor driving market expectations and the pricing of government securities
during the past year was the expected speed and magnitude of the slowdown
in economic activity in the United States. Investors’ perceptions about the likely
trajectory of future US growth became gradually less optimistic during 2006, as
worries about the fallout from the rapidly cooling housing market, a prolonged
rise in oil prices and past interest rate hikes began to take their toll. Reflecting
this, survey forecasts of US economic growth for 2007 were continuously
revised downwards, with a brief interruption in the first few months of 2007
(Graph VI.3, left-hand panel).
While changes in the outlook for US economic activity also had an impact
on bond yields outside the United States, expectations of economic growth
in the euro area and Japan certainly played an important role in yield
developments in these economies. The euro area, which saw accelerating
growth figures and gradually more optimistic expectations of future economic
activity, initially experienced smaller declines in bond yields than the United
States, followed eventually by a gradual rise in yields. In Japan, bond yields
fell less than in the United States during the period under review, as the view
formed among investors that the economy was returning to normality and that
growth was on track for a solid performance.
In addition to the outlook for growth, investors’ perceptions about future
inflation developments contributed to bond yield movements during the past
year. In the first half of 2006, inflationary pressures had been seen as gradually
increasing, in particular in the United States, while in the second half they
seemed to be easing, following past monetary policy tightening and a decline

in oil prices that lasted until the end of the year. Consistent with this, survey
forecasts for 2007 inflation began to moderate after a gradual rise in the first
months of 2006 (Graph VI.3, centre panel). However, signs in the first half of
2007 that inflation was easing off at a slower rate than previously expected led
to a partial reversal of these forecasts. Long-horizon US inflation expectations,
as approximated by the difference between nominal and real forward bond
yields, largely reflected these developments (Graph VI.3, right-hand panel).
Meanwhile, corresponding inflation measures in the euro area were more
stable, indicating a perception in markets that price pressures emanating
from improving economic activity would be counterbalanced by gradually
tighter monetary policy.

Lower term premia contributed to falling bond yields
While bond yield developments over the past year were partly shaped by
expectations of the economic outlook, other factors also had an impact. In
particular, the lack of significant upward momentum in euro area yields during
most of 2006 seemed, to some extent, at odds with the strong economic
performance of the region. Instead, declining term premia appeared to play an
important role, and also added to the downward pressure on US Treasury yields.
Term premia embedded in the term structure of interest rates represent
compensation to investors for bearing risks associated with uncertain future
interest rate developments. Estimates of such premia for the United States
and the euro area indicate that they remained low by historical standards
(Graph VI.4, left-hand panel). Moreover, while term premia seem to have
increased somewhat between late 2005 and mid-2006, they began to fall again
afterwards. Estimates show that from mid-2006 to May 2007, the nominal
10-year term premium fell by around 25 basis points in the United States. This
represented about three quarters of the total decline in the 10-year yield during

1 Model-implied expected average short-term interest rate over a 10-year horizon, calculated as the nominal
10-year yield minus the estimated 10-year term premium (shown in the lower part of the panel). The estimates
are based on the approach described below. 2 Ten-year nominal, real and inflation risk premia in yield terms,
estimated using a modified version of the essentially affine macro-finance term structure model in P Hördahl
and O Tristani, “Inflation risk premia in the term structure of interest rates”, BIS Working Papers, no 228,

the output gap and survey expectations of three-month interest rates and inflation.

this period. The remaining 10 basis points were attributed to expectations of
lower average interest rates going forward. In the euro area, the 10-year term
premium fell by around 40 basis points in the second half of 2006, before
recovering most of this decline in the first five months of 2007.
If the estimated term premium component is stripped out from 10-year
bond yields, a picture emerges that seems to better reflect the contrasting
economic developments over the past year in these two economies. The implied
path of expected average nominal interest rates over the next 10 years
continued to rise uninterruptedly for the euro area, while it levelled off and edged
downwards around mid-2006 for the United States (Graph VI.4, left-hand panel).
Some information about the underlying determinants of the estimated term
premia may be gleaned from modern term structure models. Term premia in
nominal bond yields can, loosely speaking, be decomposed into two elements,
namely an inflation risk premium and a real risk premium. The first component
reflects compensation required by investors for uncertainty surrounding
inflation, and the second reflects compensation required to take on risk
associated with changing real interest rates. By jointly modelling the dynamics
of nominal and index-linked bond yields as well as key macro variables, one
can obtain an indication of how these premia have evolved over time.
Admittedly, such estimates involve a considerable margin of uncertainty.
Moreover, the results can be affected by liquidity conditions in the various
markets, as well as by institutional factors. For example, institutional demand
factors and heavy purchases of government securities by foreign central banks
and other state institutions may have exerted downward pressure on bond
yields for some time (see Chapter VI in the 76th Annual Report ).

102

BIS 77th Annual Report

Decomposition of
term premia …

… shows that the
decline was largely
due to falling real
premia

Even so, the evidence appears to suggest that high-frequency changes in
nominal term premia were due largely to fluctuations in the real component
of these premia in the euro area, and virtually entirely so in the United States
(Graph VI.4, centre and right-hand panels). At the same time, estimates of the
euro area inflation risk premium displayed a gradual decline throughout much
of 2006, while for the United States they remained essentially flat.

Implied interest rate volatilities continued to fall

Implied swaption
volatilities fell
further

The decline in estimated term premia may, to some extent, have been due to
perceptions among investors that uncertainty associated with future interest
rate moves had fallen. Indeed, as proxied by implied volatilities on swaptions
(options on interest rate swaps), there is some evidence that the perceived
degree of interest rate uncertainty may have declined. For example, the term
structure of implied swaption volatilities for 10-year US swap rates continued
to shift downwards during 2006 and early 2007 (Graph VI.5, left-hand panel),
and similar falls were seen for other swap rates. The sharp sell-offs in global
financial markets that took place in May–June 2006 and late February–March
2007 had little impact on swaption volatilities in general, although near-term
volatility on short-term rates displayed a brief surge during the second
episode.
While changes in the required compensation for volatility risk – ie the
volatility risk premium – may have influenced swaption volatilities as well, there
are some indications that they may have played a smaller role. The volatility
risk premium can be proxied by the gap between the implied volatility and the
corresponding volatility expected by investors. One way of measuring volatility

expectations is by using forecasts obtained from time series models. Such
estimates indicate that the fall in swaption volatilities, while quite sharp, was
nonetheless mainly due to expectations among investors that future volatility
would continue to drop. Specifically, the decline in implied volatility during the
past few years was in large part mirrored by lower (out-of-sample) forecasts of
volatility generated by a model that allows for changes in the perceived longrun level of volatility. Moreover, the observed fall in implied swaption volatilities
coincided with a downward trend in realised long-term interest rate volatility
(Graph VI.5, centre panel).
Given that the swap spread over US Treasuries has remained quite stable
in the recent past, the steady decline in the volatility of swap rates since mid2003 has been largely matched by falling volatility on 10-year US bond yields
(Graph VI.5, right-hand panel). In turn, there is some evidence suggesting that
this decline might have reflected greater perceived stability of macroeconomic
fundamentals. In particular, the inflation compensation of nominal bond yields
has become less volatile, which, together with steady inflation risk premia, is
consistent with less volatile long-horizon expectations of inflation. This might
reflect greater central bank credibility, or perceptions among investors that
future inflationary shocks hitting the economy are likely to be smaller than in
the past. A general reduction in the variability of the estimated term premium,
mostly due to a less volatile real risk premium, may also have contributed to
lower interest rate volatility.

the index increasing by 19% between end-March 2006 and mid-May 2007,
outpacing US and Japanese share price growth of 17% and 2%, respectively
(Graph VI.6, left-hand panel). Shares were on the whole stronger throughout the
emerging markets, with prices in Latin America, Asia and Europe rising by 37%,
28% and 10%, respectively (Graph VI.6, centre panel). Episodes of heightened
volatility surrounding the sell-offs were also brief. As a result, share price
volatilities were close to historical lows in late 2006 and were still well below
global long-term averages in May 2007 (Graph VI.7, left-hand and centre panels).

Strong earnings buoyed markets

… supported by
strong earnings

A key support for global equity prices was provided by strong earnings of listed
firms in developed country markets. Even as GDP growth cooled in the United
States in the third quarter of 2006, this initially had a minimal effect on
corporate earnings, which showed signs of slowing only towards the end
of the year. To be sure, stagnating house prices did affect the profitability
and performance of sectors such as home construction in 2006 (Graph VI.6,
right-hand panel). Earnings growth in Europe was also generally strong,
with robust economic activity in the United Kingdom, Germany and France
helping equity markets shrug off continued tightening by the Bank of England
and the ECB. Japanese profit performance lagged after the acceleration in
early 2006.
Gains in equity prices in emerging markets coincided with generally
favourable macroeconomic conditions (see Chapter III) and a strong appetite
for risk among global investors. Sharp appreciation in the materials sector
(Graph VI.6, right-hand panel), which includes metals and mining, partly
reflected high growth in industrialising emerging markets such as China. In

BIS 77th Annual Report

105

addition, contagion effects from political unrest in individual markets, such as
those in Hungary, Thailand and Ecuador, were quite limited. Even so, shares
in the energy sector stagnated after mid-2006, in line with lower oil prices, as
did share prices in oil-exporting Russia, which suffered particularly severe
declines at the start of 2007. In contrast to developed country markets,
earnings growth in emerging markets did not keep up with equity prices, and
earnings multiples rose sharply (Graph VI.9, centre panel), consistent with
increasing risk appetite for emerging market assets.
Global stock markets incurred heavy losses in May–June 2006 and late
February–March 2007, with the global MSCI index falling from peak to trough
by 13% and 7%, respectively. The mid-2006 sell-off appeared to be driven
more by a weakening in investor appetite for risk than by a reassessment
of fundamentals (Graph VI.7, right-hand panel); as a result, emerging market
equity prices experienced the most significant retreat, falling by 26%. By
contrast, the early 2007 sell-off coincided with concern over US macroeconomic
weakness (particularly in the housing market). Although a sharp correction in
the Chinese stock exchange occurred at the beginning of the sell-off, emerging
markets did not underperform developed country shares as much as in
mid-2006. Compared to mid-2006, the global sell-off was also brief, and the
increases in volatility measures and decrease in risk appetite were mostly
retraced within a month (Graph VI.7).

Risk appetite
fuelled emerging
market returns …

Merger and acquisition activity supported the market
Current and prospective changes in capital structure also helped to support
equity prices. Share buybacks continued to increase, as S&P 500 companies
purchased more than $430 billion worth of their own shares in 2006, well above
the record levels scored just the previous year. In addition, the volume of
leveraged buyouts (LBOs) surged to $753 billion, with takeover bids by private
equity investors in 2006 exceeding (in constant dollars) those achieved in the
peak year of the LBO explosion in the late 1980s. One highly noticeable
difference between the latest and earlier booms was that the targets were no
longer overwhelmingly US corporations; in fact, European targets constituted
31% of the announced value of all deals, as opposed to less than 10% in 1988.
Targets in emerging markets and other countries also accounted for a
significant proportion (Graph VI.8, left-hand panel).
The more general category of merger and acquisition (M&A) activity grew
substantially from the elevated levels of 2005, with $4.1 trillion in announced
M&As in 2006, the highest level (in real terms) since 2000. M&A activity was
particularly strong in Europe, growing by 52% in 2006. This expansion pushed
the value of all deals to $1.2 trillion, a level approaching that in the United
States (Graph VI.8, centre panel). The unprecedented activity in the market for
corporate control was probably one reason for the strength of the European
equity market. In December 2006, buoyed to a significant extent by news of
potential corporate takeovers, the main European share index posted positive
returns on 10 consecutive days, the longest such rally since 1997.
The volume of initial public offerings (IPOs) was higher than in any year
since 2000. A particularly large number of deals originated in Asia, where the

Valuations
P/E ratios fell in the
United States and
the euro area …

… and rose in
emerging markets

Against the backdrop of such robust earnings, resilient share prices did not
lead to increasing valuations in developed country markets, at least on the
basis of several popular measures. Rather, revisions to profit forecasts
generally outpaced price increases. The S&P 500 remained around 15 times
one-year-ahead forecast earnings in 2006, a multiple slightly above that for the
euro area MSCI. Both levels were in fact slightly below their long-term average of
16 over 1988–2005. In Japan, although price/earnings (P/E) ratios had increased
sharply in the second half of 2005 and early 2006, they remained substantially
below the levels of the previous decades (Graph VI.9, left-hand panel).
In contrast, emerging market valuations were quite buoyant, as they
continued to rise sharply from 2005 (Graph VI.9, centre panel). This appreciation
was most pronounced in Asia, although valuations in emerging Europe have
grown more rapidly over the past five years. Despite the recent advances,
valuations were still well below those of the late 1990s (before the equity
downturn) in each of the major emerging market regions.
To be sure, valuations in developed countries looked more stretched when
based on historical measures of profits rather than short-term forecasts. As
discussed below, in the United States profits as a share of GDP were close to
historical highs in 2006 (see Graph VI.15). The ratio of US real equity prices
to a 10-year moving average of real earnings smooths cyclical variation, and

end of 2006, this P/E ratio was well above its historical average at around 25,
compared to an average of just below 20 since the early 1980s (Graph VI.9,

Credit spreads hovered near historical lows
Yield spreads on all types of debt tightened during the period under review,
although spreads on riskier debt contracted the most. The rally in credit
markets was twice interrupted by periods of market turbulence, which turned
out to be relatively brief in duration. Sound corporate fundamentals, as well as
strong investor demand for structured credit products and greater investor risk
appetite, seemed to be important forces behind the rally.

High-yield debt outperformed
The rally in riskier credits took spreads to new lows in some markets
(Graph VI.10). By late May 2007, an index of spreads on US high-yield corporate
bonds, at just over 250 basis points, had fallen below its previous low reached
prior to the sell-off in credit markets in the second quarter of 2005, and was
within a few basis points of its low of 235 in October 1997. Similarly, spreads on
European high-yield bonds fell below 190 basis points, more than 40 basis points
less than the previous low reached in March 2005. Spreads on US and European
investment grade corporate bonds remained within a relatively tight band
and, in late May 2007, were only a few basis points wider than in March 2006.
The first temporary repricing of credit risk took place from mid-May 2006.
From 288 basis points on 12 May 2006, US high-yield corporate bond spreads
widened by 47 basis points by the end of June. The high-yield credit default
swap (CDS) index would have widened significantly more in June and July

were it not for the automobile sector: CDS spreads on General Motors and
Ford narrowed by more than 300 basis points between end-June and endAugust. Spreads on risky assets remained elevated through August, but
resumed their downward trajectory in late September. In May and June, flows
from high-yield credits into safer assets left spreads on more highly rated
borrowers less affected. For example, spreads on A-rated corporate bonds
in both the United States and Europe widened by less than 10 basis points
during this episode.
A second bout of turbulence in credit markets occurred in late February
and March 2007, although this turned out to have a smaller overall impact. On
27 February, amidst a global sell-off in equity markets, spreads on US highyield bonds jumped by more than 20 basis points, and continued to rise for
around four days thereafter. While equity markets had, for the most part,
recouped their losses within three weeks of the sell-off, credit markets were
somewhat slower to recover. US high-yield bond spreads did not approach
their late February low until the second half of May.
Contributing to market uncertainty was growing concern over the US
subprime housing market. Delinquency rates on subprime loans, which had
hovered near 10% for much of 2004 and 2005, reached 13% by end-2006, with
much of the increase occurring in the fourth quarter (see Chapter VII). This led
to a series of bankruptcies of subprime lenders, and to a significant widening
from November 2006 of spreads on non-investment grade tranches of home
equity loans (Graph VI.11, left-hand panel). Following HSBC’s announcement
on 8 February 2007 that more funds would have to be set aside to cover bad
debts in its subprime lending portfolio, and New Century Financial’s downward
revision of its 2007 loan volume forecast, spreads in this market segment
widened by no less than 200 basis points in the space of two days.
Whether and how the problems in the US subprime mortgage market may
spill over into other markets remains unclear. In part, the risks are limited

because of the relatively small size of the subprime market. Loans to these
borrowers constituted only 21% of total US mortgage lending in 2006, and
14% of the total mortgage loans outstanding at the end of the year. That
said, investors have become increasingly concerned about the effect that a
continued deterioration might have on valuations of collateralised debt
obligations (CDOs) backed by asset-backed securities (ABSs). Exactly where in
the CDO market the risks posed by subprime and Alt-A mortgages (which also
do not have prime borrower status) are concentrated is difficult to measure.
Estimates based on individual CDO deals indicate that ABSs account for
approximately one third of the total collateral backing cash CDOs (Graph VI.11,
centre panel). Industry estimates suggest that a substantial share is backed
by subprime and Alt-A mortgages. Spreads on tranches of CDOs backed by
mezzanine tranches of ABSs began to widen in late January 2007, signalling
that investors assigned a higher probability to a significant deterioration in the
underlying collateral pool (Graph VI.11, right-hand panel).

Greater investor risk appetite
While generally healthy corporate balance sheets (see below) buoyed
valuations in credit markets, there is also evidence that changes in investors’
risk appetite contributed to the downward trend in spreads on risky assets.
A simple estimate of the price of a “unit” of risk in a particular credit market
segment is obtained from the ratio of default probabilities derived from credit
spreads to those derived from underlying balance sheet information, in this
case Moody’s-KMV estimated default frequencies (EDFs). The higher this ratio,
the higher the compensation demanded by creditors for bearing a given level
of default risk. To be sure, EDFs may themselves contain some element of
market sentiment because they in part reflect equity prices and volatilities.
That said, they are a reasonable approximation of market participants’ view of
fundamental default risk.

Broadly speaking, these indicators suggest that investors’ risk appetite
increased through much of 2006. Clearly, strong corporate performance
contributed to the low level of both EDFs and CDS premia during the period
under review. However, CDS premia have declined relatively more, suggesting
that changes in investor risk appetite, above and beyond changes in
fundamentals, were a significant factor behind the movement in high-yield
credit spreads (Graph VI.12). The estimated price of credit risk, which peaked
in late 2005, declined during much of 2006 and early 2007, only briefly
interrupted by the May–June 2006 sell-off. The most recent available data
indicate that the increase in high-yield spreads in late February and March
2007 was largely due to increases in the price of risk.

Soaring issuance of structured credit products
Record CDO
issuance …

The downward trend in high-yield credit spreads coincided with a period of
robust issuance of structured credit products, causing some observers to raise
the possibility that the growth in the CDO market since 2004 has contributed to
spread compression. Global issuance of US dollar- and euro-denominated
cash CDOs in 2006, at $470 billion, was the highest on record, with particularly
strong activity in the fourth quarter (Graph VI.13). Similarly, issuance of
synthetic CDOs (or CDOs of CDSs) was also much higher in 2006, at
$524 billion, as was trading in CDS index tranches ($1,736 billion).
There are at least two channels through which the issuance of structured
products may exert downward pressure on credit spreads. At a general level,
issuance of cash CDOs enlarges the investor base – and hence demand – for
corporate debt securities. Investors targeting highly rated securities can
indirectly obtain exposure to non-investment grade corporate debt by
purchasing the senior tranches of CDOs. In addition, issuers of synthetic CDOs
and other structured credit products generate returns by selling default

protection in the CDS market, which can improve liquidity in both the derivatives
and cash markets. Indeed, the supply of protection generated by structured
issuance could be even larger than that suggested by the notional values of
the CDOs. For example, the hedging of single-tranche CDOs, where only a
particular interval of the default distribution is sold off to investors, requires
that arrangers sell protection amounting to a multiple of the notional value in
order to offset the high price sensitivity of these tranches. The multiples of
more complex products, such as constant proportion portfolio insurance
(CPPI) and constant proportion debt obligations (CPDOs) can be even higher.
While structured issuance can, in principle, exert downward pressure on
spreads through either channel, the available evidence suggests that it may not
have been a decisive factor in 2006, at least in the high-yield markets. Less
than 1% of the total issuance of cash CDOs had bonds as the underlying
collateral, and a large proportion of these were rated investment grade.
Similarly, issuance of synthetic CDOs, index tranches and CPDOs related
mainly to investment grade entities. While aggregate CDO issuance coincides
with tighter high-yield CDS premia, simple regression analysis suggests that
this relationship is weak and only marginally statistically significant at a
monthly frequency.
That said, there does appear to be some evidence that the growth in
synthetic CDO issuance may have contributed to the decoupling of spreads on
investment grade bonds and their corresponding CDS premia (Graph VI.10,
right-hand panel). From the end of the sell-off in credit markets in March 2005
to late February 2007, US dollar and euro investment grade CDS spreads
tightened continuously, at a time of particularly high structured issuance. By
contrast, investment grade asset swap spreads changed little overall.

Healthy corporate

With spreads near historical lows, credit markets were arguably vulnerable to
a repricing. The episodes of market turbulence during the period under review
may have reflected market participants’ latent nervousness that the balance of
risks tends to be skewed towards the downside when times are good.
In the near term, however, few market participants appear to be overly
concerned about a sudden and widespread deterioration in credit quality.
Speculative grade corporate default rates fell below 2% in 2005, and have
remained near that level since, consistently coming in below rating agencies’
forecasts (Graph VI.14). Even so, the fact that spreads on short- and mediumterm instruments have narrowed more than those on longer-maturity debt
does suggest that market participants generally expect default rates to rise.
A slowdown in corporate profitability could be one factor leading to a
reassessment of credit risk. Although overall corporate profitability in the
United States in 2006 was the strongest on record (see above), profit growth
slowed markedly in late 2006 and early 2007. While positive surprises on
earnings announcements again outnumbered negative ones in the fourth
quarter, they did so by a much smaller margin than in previous quarters.
Positive surprises rebounded somewhat in the first quarter of 2007, although
this largely reflected lower expectations rather than a higher rate of profit
growth.
The impact of slowing corporate earnings on the overall default rate may,
for a time, be mitigated by the healthy state of corporate balance sheets.
Indeed, broad measures of corporate health suggest little cause for concern
(Graph VI.15). In the aggregate, corporate leverage levels in the United States
and Japan stayed well below those seen at the height of the dotcom boom, and
have been falling in the euro area. Similarly, the ratio of liquid assets to total
debt remained just below its recent peak in the United States, and continued
its upward trend in Japan and the euro area. Finally, corporate profits as a

percentage of GDP were high in 2006. At least in the United States, the current
situation appears quite different from that prior to the turning of the credit
cycle in the late 1980s and late 1990s, when corporate profits were lower and
leverage was somewhat higher than today.
At first sight, the downward trend in corporate leverage appears to be at
odds with the increasing volumes of M&A activity and other shareholderfriendly actions documented above (Graph VI.8). However, shareholder-friendly
activity is still not particularly large relative to the corporate sector on a national
accounts basis. Even in the United States, the total value of LBOs amounted
to approximately 3% of the total market value of equity in 2006, and it was
relatively widely spread across sectors.
That said, LBO activity can lead to a substantial rise in the indebtedness
of individual firms, increasing the risks of large firm default and sectoral
distress. The majority of recent M&A deals have been paid for in cash, often
raised in debt markets. Equity-financed deals accounted for only 12% of the
total announced deal value in 2006, down from 19% in 2004 and 26% in 2002.
Cash-financed acquisitions tend to result in greater indebtedness than equityfinanced deals. Figures from a major rating agency indicate that the average
debt/cash flow ratio for companies acquired by private equity firms reached a
record high of 5.4 in 2006 (see also Chapter VII). Losses to existing debt
holders upon unanticipated changes in the capital structure have been high;
according to some calculations, the five largest LBOs of public companies in
2006 resulted in mark to market losses of around $2 billion for the owners of
the target companies’ outstanding bonds.
Sooner or later the credit cycle will turn, and default rates will begin to
rise. Strategies that earn handsome profits when spreads are low could

suddenly turn out to be riskier than anticipated. In particular, it is not clear
whether the current level of spreads is high enough to compensate for a return
to even modestly higher default rates. Calculations by an investment bank
suggest that the current low level of credit spreads in the US dollar high-yield
market would not have compensated investors for the actual defaults
experienced since the mid-1970s by any cohort of five-year corporate bonds.

Strong demand for emerging market assets
A rally in emerging
markets …

… was based
on strong
fundamentals …

Asset prices in emerging markets followed a similar pattern to that in mature
markets. Emerging equity markets, in particular, continued their unusually
strong performance of previous years (see above). Spreads on emerging
market external sovereign debt continued to narrow, albeit at a slower pace
than in 2005, with the EMBI Global falling to new lows (Graph VI.16). Spreads
on this debt fell below those on US corporate debt with the same rating. As in
developed country credit markets, spreads widened only temporarily during
the two sell-offs that occurred during the period under review. Yields on local
currency debt rose sharply in the first half of 2006, but declined thereafter.
The strong performance of emerging market assets was underpinned by
yet another year of vibrant economic performance. Emerging market
economies continued to experience rapid growth, and many countries further
improved their fiscal and balance of payments positions, contributing to limited
issuance of external debt (see Chapter III). In addition, some countries
continued their policy of replacing foreign currency debt with local currency
bonds. At $6 billion, net issuance of international bonds by emerging market
governments was higher than in the previous year ($5 billion), but remained far
below the levels recorded in the late 1990s (close to $50 billion per year). Nongovernment debtors took advantage of the favourable financing conditions in

2006, with $130 billion in new issuance, almost four fifths of which was by
financial institutions. Equity issuance also reached new highs, with several very
large IPOs from the financial sector, primarily in China and Russia.
While isolated political and economic events also contributed to volatility,
they had little lasting effect overall. For example, spreads on Ecuador’s
external debt soared from less than 500 basis points in the summer of 2006 to
more than 1,000 basis points in January 2007, over concern about an
Argentine-style debt restructuring, although they later retraced much of this.
A military coup in Thailand and riots in Hungary led to a general widening of
spreads in September 2006, but this reversed within days. In December 2006,
the imposition of capital controls in Thailand to stem the appreciation of
the baht led to a 15% drop in the Bangkok stock exchange on the day of the
announcement, and a depreciation of the baht by 4% over the following days,
but had little impact elsewhere. However, stock prices in Thailand recovered
most of their losses over the next few months after the authorities exempted
many transactions from the controls. A widespread nationalisation programme
introduced by the Venezuelan government in early 2007 drove up credit
spreads and led stocks to plummet, but had little effect on other markets.
Similarly, a political crisis in Turkey around the same time had little impact on
emerging markets as a whole. Despite these events, average political risk
across 22 emerging markets, based on a widely used measure, declined
noticeably in the first half of 2006 and remained stable thereafter, as increasing
risks in some countries were offset by declining risks in others (Graph VI.16,
left-hand panel).

… and largely
unaffected by
political events

Are emerging market assets going mainstream?
Investing in emerging market assets used to be the domain of specialised
investors. This is no longer the case. According to one limited set of data, the
participation of “high-grade” investors, or investors whose primary mandate
is investments in highly rated assets, increased to just under 40% of client
turnover in 2006, from 7% 10 years ago (Graph VI.17, left-hand panel).
Specialist emerging market investors, such as dedicated mutual funds or
specialised hedge funds, remain significant, although their strategy appears to
have shifted from investing primarily in external sovereign debt to local
currency assets.
High returns, and the perceived benefits of portfolio diversification, have
led non-specialist investors to channel funds into emerging market assets.
According to a standard portfolio model estimated over the period January
2002–March 2006 (admittedly a period of high returns), investing in US dollardenominated sovereign emerging market bonds would have considerably
improved the risk/return characteristics of a portfolio relative to a benchmark
containing no emerging market investments (Graph VI.17, centre panel). On an
ex post basis, adding emerging market equities and local currency debt would
have shifted out the portfolio frontier even further.
While exposures to emerging markets could in principle increase the risk
of sharp losses at times of stress, this was not the case during the two
relatively mild sell-offs during the period under review. For example, a portfolio

with a large proportion of emerging market assets would have performed worse
than a similar portfolio of developed economy assets only during the sell-off in
May–June 2006, in particular if it contained local currency bonds. However, the
difference in performance between these portfolios would have disappeared
within weeks of this episode as markets recovered. In February 2007, a higher
share of emerging market investment would even have had a stabilising effect
on the value of a portfolio.
While emerging market assets have clearly become more popular among
institutional investors, it would be premature to consider them a truly
“mainstream” asset class. One obstacle to greater participation by foreign
investors is the presence of capital controls in many emerging market
economies. Such restrictions might explain the much lower rates of
participation by foreign investors in Asian local currency bond markets
compared to those in central and eastern Europe or Latin America, where
capital controls are less common. That said, foreign investors can to some
extent obtain exposure even to restricted markets, indirectly through nondeliverable forwards (see Chapter III). These instruments are traded offshore
and settled in foreign currency. Thus, they replicate the payoffs of local
instruments without involving any transaction in the currency of the target
market.
A second obstacle to more foreign investment, in particular in local
currency bond markets, is the limited availability of instruments to hedge
exchange rate and interest rate risk. While hedging currency movements over
a few months is generally feasible, it is much more difficult to obtain protection
against fluctuations in exchange rates over longer periods of time. The problem

is even more acute when it comes to trading interest rate risk. Only a few
countries, namely Korea, Singapore and, to a lesser extent, Mexico, have a
liquid market for bond futures (Graph VI.17, right-hand panel), although
derivatives on short-term interest rates are more widely available. The absence
of a liquid futures market could also detract from the development of a market
for interest rate swaps, as swap dealers often use futures to hedge their
positions. While far from comprehensive, the available BIS data show sizeable
interest rate swap positions only in the Hong Kong dollar, although local
sources of data indicate activity in several other currencies.
A third obstacle could be that the resilience of emerging market assets
remains unproven under less benign global conditions. Since the default by
Argentina in late 2001, there has been no major disruption in emerging
markets. This is in sharp contrast with the experience of the 1980s and 1990s,
when investors at times incurred heavy losses on their investments in these
markets.

VII. The financial sector in the advanced
industrial countries

Highlights
Overall, the financial sector in the advanced industrial countries registered a
good performance in the period under review. Building on the strengths of recent
years, financial firms continued to improve profitability against a backdrop of
generally favourable economic conditions and strong capital market activity.
However, compared to the recent past, the picture was less uniform across
institutions. In certain segments, clear signs emerged that excessively optimistic
expectations might have been boosting the recent growth in activity.
The more sizeable risks to financial stability appear to lie in the medium
term. Given the strong position of balance sheets and current profit levels,
financial systems are well positioned to cope with likely near-term sources of
strain. The potentially more important sources of vulnerability are indirect and
remain linked to broader macroeconomic developments. The implications of
past risk-taking, in the form of exposures related to property investments and
to the leveraged financing boom, will depend critically on the future path of
interest rates and the economy as a whole. A turn in the credit cycle, or a more
general worsening of macroeconomic conditions, including a weakening in
household spending, remain key sources of longer-term vulnerability.
Financial globalisation has been a major structural trend with important
implications for the organisation of banking firms, the nature of their business
strategies and their risk profiles. Banking firms seeking growth through crossborder mergers and exposures outside their home markets have created a
network of international capital flows which offers profit and diversification
opportunities. At the same time, these strategies carry a number of risks that
relate to the performance of both individual institutions and national economies.
As a result, the internationalisation of banking also has implications for
prudential structures and for the calibration of policy instruments.

The performance of financial firms
The sound overall performance of financial firms continued to be supported
by largely the same factors that have driven the positive results over the past
several years. A favourable macroeconomic environment has provided the
foundation upon which firms have built, taking advantage of the increased
scope for diversification through new risk transfer instruments, the rapid pace
of innovation in financial markets, and continuing efforts to control costs. The
sector’s general optimism about the rewards from risk-taking has so far been
supported by a benign credit environment and generous revenues from
expansion into new areas. The financial system as a whole has been able to

BIS 77th Annual Report

119

deal effectively with problems that materialised with individual firms or specific
markets, indicating the existence of comfortable cushions and a sufficient
degree of flexibility to respond to shocks. However, patchy performance in
various segments, coupled with a general trend towards higher leverage and
more aggressive risk-taking, also suggests that those attributes could be put
to more severe tests in the medium term.

Commercial banks
Commercial banks had a solid overall performance last year. Profits remained
generally buoyant, helped by continuing growth in credit demand, low costs
from defaults and low yield curve volatility (Table VII.1).
European banks continued to pursue growth on the basis of fee-generating
services to households and retail business clients. Credit growth remained
quite strong overall, although its pace began to moderate in countries like
Spain, where it has been the strongest for some time (Graph VII.1). Moreover,
surveys point to a relaxation of credit standards vis-à-vis households and
businesses. Competitive pressures and access to alternative sources of funding
have combined to encourage less stringent covenants on loans, in particular
for corporate borrowers engaged in mergers and acquisitions. The increased
ability of lenders to diversify away credit risk through derivatives or
securitisation, or in the fast-growing secondary loan market, may also have
contributed to this slippage in standards. Nevertheless, banks in most countries
do not appear to be facing difficulties in managing pressures from defaults. On
the contrary, provisions are generally low and declining. In those cases where
signs of deteriorating quality of loan portfolios did appear, such as in the United
Kingdom and Spain, lenders were able to maintain healthy profit levels.

Graph VII.1

European banks continued to consolidate. The removal of actual and
perceived obstacles to mergers in countries like Germany and Italy has
encouraged deals, which in the case of Italy have been the single most
important driver of bank share performance. The prospective cross-border
merger involving some of Europe’s largest banks is also likely to trigger
further deals among competitors. However, for most of the period under review,
acquiring banks were primarily focused on exploiting rapid growth opportunities
by establishing a presence in countries that have recently acceded to the
European Union and in emerging markets in south-eastern Europe.
US banks remained healthy and profitable, but a few signs began to
suggest a possible tapering-off of profit growth. Although the period under
review saw the sixth consecutive year of record earnings, the average return
on assets and equity fell slightly while overall profits seemed to decelerate in
the second half of the year. This was mostly the result of the continued
compression of interest margins and the slowdown in housing market activity
and associated revenues from mortgage lending. The effect was more
pronounced for smaller lenders, whereas larger banks were more successful
in supplementing their income from a broader range of non-interest sources.
Banks remained well capitalised but, although provisioning costs stayed at very
low levels, non-performing loans and charge-offs edged up, especially in loan
categories where growth had been strongest in recent years. More recently,
lenders are reported to have tightened credit standards in their retail book,
apparently in response to increased signs that debt levels might be stretching
the balance sheets of higher-risk households (see Chapter II). At the same
time, survey evidence suggests that terms on credit to businesses eased.
Japanese banks registered a second consecutive year of positive financial
results, albeit not an improvement over the previous year’s performance.
Lower operating profits reflected the continuing pressure on margins and
the persistently weak growth in credit demand. Having recovered a sense
of stability on the domestic front, Japanese banks have been exploring
opportunities to expand abroad, especially in Asia. The public sector continued
to divest from its banking interests through privatisation and changes in the
profile of state-owned lenders.

BIS 77th Annual Report

Investment banks
The period under review saw yet another year of record profits for investment
banks. Strong drivers of revenue growth were the corporate advisory
business, prime brokerage services and proprietary activities, including those
associated with private equity deals. Higher profits were also supported in
the near term by an increased appetite for risk among the major international
houses.
It was also a record year for merger and acquisition (M&A) transactions,
partly due to booming activity of private equity funds (see Chapter VI). In
addition to receiving advisory fees, investment banks benefited from this
activity in a variety of ways. Larger houses supported these deals by offering
loan financing to the private equity acquirer, but also by participating in
many cases as equity investors committing their own funds. Securities
underwriting contributed significantly to income growth (Graph VII.2), although
the business environment favoured larger houses with global operations, to
the disadvantage of lower-tier investment banks.
Proprietary trading and involvement in the structured finance business
have been another important source of investment bank profits for some time.
Major US houses registered record gains from such activities and were able to
boost their return on equity beyond 20%. Universal banks relied more on the
strength of their asset and wealth management franchise to achieve similar,
albeit lower returns. Broader market liquidity and active trading by clients,
including hedge funds, boosted the profits of those firms with strong capital
markets functions.
Higher profits have been associated with higher risk-taking. Disclosed
figures of value-at-risk (VaR) for major investment banks have almost doubled
since 2002 (Graph VII.2). Viewed against the backdrop of a low-volatility
environment, this increase indicates an intensifying propensity to take on
risk, although the relationship of VaR to equity has remained relatively

outstanding bonds, as measured by the premia on credit default swaps

about the potential risks in their investment strategy in the event of a turn
in market conditions.

Hedge funds
Continuing trends
among hedge

Developments in the hedge fund sector did not deviate significantly from the
patterns established in the previous year. Continuing moderate investment
performance, punctuated by the high-profile failure of a large fund, went hand
in hand with a slowdown in the rate of growth of the sector. At the same time,
the trend towards greater institutionalisation persisted, allied with continuing
calls for greater transparency in funds’ activities.
Overall, average investment performance remained subdued during the
period under review (Graph VII.3, left-hand panel). Many funds experienced
strains during the second quarter of 2006, and while performance rebounded
slightly during the fourth quarter, returns suffered again in the subsequent
one. Net inflows remained volatile during most of the period, before turning
moderately negative towards the end of 2006. Investor interest in the sector
appears to have levelled off over the past couple of years, and closures have
outnumbered new funds launched.
The search for yield opportunities has attracted hedge fund activity to
many of the booming markets for risk transfer, most notably those related
to credit risk. Hedge funds have become key suppliers of liquidity in these
markets through active trading, while their willingness to take on risk has
supported the hedging operations of those institutions that are more focused
on originating and servicing the underlying assets. Coming under greater

competitive pressure, and making use of favourable funding conditions, the
sector has opted for somewhat higher leverage levels compared to the recent
past, in an effort to boost returns (Graph VII.3, right-hand panel).
The combination of an opportunistic investment style and reliance on
leverage has prompted concerns among some market observers about hedge
funds’ ability to withstand a more challenging market environment. In fact, the
failure of a large fund due to outsize bets in the natural gas market served as
a reminder of the potential fragility of hedge funds’ financial strategy. In that
particular event, however, other market participants were ready to contribute
to the smooth unwinding of these positions, and the fund’s difficulties did not
have repercussions in the broader market.
An important change in the sector has been the trend towards greater
transparency. Some of the larger fund companies have sought stock exchange
listing or have disclosed information about their operations in the process of
issuing public bonds. Rating agencies are also prepared to issue counterparty
ratings for hedge funds. On the official side, pressure continues towards more
formal arrangements for the oversight of the sector.

Insurance companies
The fortunes of insurance companies improved during the period under review.
More favourable market conditions shored up balance sheets in all sectors,
while the non-life sector made a dramatic recovery from the challenging
environment of the previous year.
Healthy equity market performance and somewhat higher interest rates
improved life insurers’ balance sheets and boosted demand for their
policies (Graph VII.4). In the United States, individual variable annuity sales
continued to grow strongly, thanks to a rising stock market and the increase
in the number of retirees. In France, life insurance premium growth was
driven by a surge in demand for unit-linked policies, while growth in the
UK annuity market was supported by strong demand by pension funds.

By contrast, the recovery in premium growth in Japan halted, as the increased
demand for individual annuities failed to offset the decline in individual life
insurance premiums.
Relatively low long-term yields represent a challenge to life insurers,
especially in the presence of minimum guaranteed returns on their policies.
Flat yield curves do not encourage demand for savings-type products, while
low long-term interest rates raise the cost of their funding. This increases
companies’ dependence on sales of investment-type products. Given the large
financial market exposure of life insurers, a potential turn in the credit cycle
and adverse global macroeconomic developments could pose risks to
profitability.
Non-life companies recovered well from a very costly 2005, when claims
had surged as a result of a series of natural catastrophes. Most US and
Bermudian property and casualty insurers and reinsurers registered a
remarkable turnaround, as firmer premium rates, a low level of claims and
strong investment performance combined to boost income and restore
profitability. In contrast, premium growth for European non-life insurers was
more modest, while Japanese non-life insurers exhibited lower net profits
owing to higher typhoon-related claims and investment losses.
Despite the relatively benign 2006 tropical storm season, the coming
years are expected to witness a higher level of hurricane-related losses in the
United States than the pre-2005 average. The increased risk raised premium
rates and limited global reinsurance capacity in 2006. In order to overcome
capacity limits and withstand large-scale natural disasters more easily, non-life
insurers are likely to continue building up their capital buffers.

Vulnerabilities
The main sources of financial system risk may be rooted in possible excesses
over the past years of growth, but their effects may only materialise over the
medium term. Elevated exposures to real estate, an increase in leveraged
finance, including in the booming private equity market, and a worsening in the
credit cycle are important areas of vulnerability. In the near term, the continuing
good performance of the financial sector augurs well for the system’s ability to
withstand likely shocks. Over the longer run, the severity of strains will remain
critically connected to future macroeconomic developments.

Property exposures
The possibility of a slump in real estate markets remains a significant risk to
financial stability. Over the past several years, real estate financing has been a
major activity and an important source of profits for banks in many countries
(Graph VII.5). The boom in the markets for securitised assets related to
property financing has spread the direct and indirect exposures to property risk
widely across the financial system. Residential property investments account
for most of the growth in exposures. Commercial property markets are arguably
less exuberant, although markets for related investments are susceptible to
contagion from their residential counterparts (see Chapter VI).

Residential real estate
The buoyancy of residential property prices in many jurisdictions has been
supported to a large extent by low interest rates and accompanied by a rapid
expansion of mortgage credit to households. Intensified mortgage activity has
also been an important source of fee income for the originating institutions.
Moreover, a favourable economic environment has meant that credit costs
associated with overall mortgage defaults have stayed at historically low levels,
further flattering the bottom line of banks and other mortgage holders. The low
incidence of losses has also supported the deepening of structured finance
markets for residential mortgages by stimulating the interest of portfolio
investors in securities linked to the cash flows from such loans.
Greater securitisation has brought about a broader dispersion of
exposures among market participants but has also distorted the incentives
of mortgage originators, principally in the United States. By placing greater
emphasis on income that is directly linked to the volume of originated loans,

securitisation has often led to an erosion of credit standards. In addition,
mounting competitive pressures and extrapolative expectations about house
price growth have arguably led to an underpricing of mortgage risk, a shift
towards floating rate contracts designed to keep servicing costs low early in the
life of the loan, and a boom in the issuance of the riskier types of mortgage
(Graph VII.6, left-hand panel). As a result, moderate increases in the level of
interest rates have affected a larger fraction of outstanding mortgages than in
the past. Delinquencies have risen, especially among the most recent loan
vintages to high-risk categories of borrowers whose access to financing had
been severely restricted in the past (Graph VII.6, right-hand panel).
Future developments in interest rates, house prices and overall business
conditions will play a key role in mitigating or exacerbating these risks. Interest
rates will influence the cost of servicing existing mortgage debt and affect the
demand for new loans, while the state of the business cycle will impact
household incomes (see Chapter II). Forced sales are likely to compound the
unsold housing stock, putting further downward pressure on house prices.

have been falling from a high level, and prices have been rebounding from
generally low levels (Table VII.2).
Commercial bank lending to the sector has been growing sharply in a
number of countries, in some cases triggering concern among regulators. US
banks have nearly doubled their commercial property loans over the last five
years, with such loans making up 14% of total assets in September 2006. Loan
growth has been mostly concentrated in small and medium-sized banks, where
commercial real estate lending amounts to more than three times their riskweighted capital. In Japan, bank regulators have cautioned lenders against
indiscriminately increasing their exposures to commercial property.
The publicly traded segments of the market have been performing
exceedingly strongly. Annual market rates of return on equity stakes in
commercial real estate investment vehicles have been in the range of 15–20% in
the past three years, making the asset class a favourite among investors searching
for higher yields. However, returns seem to be driven mainly by capital gains
as rental yields have remained steady or even declined in some markets, such
as the United Kingdom and the United States. This raises the possibility that a
worsening of the strains in the markets for securitised residential mortgages could
create ripple effects in traded markets for commercial real estate investments.

Leveraged financing
A feature of financial sector activity over the past several years has been a
greater reliance on leverage to enhance investment returns. Two manifestations
of this feature have been the boom in the activity of private equity funds and
the gradual trend towards more highly leveraged strategies among hedge funds.
In both cases, the incidence of higher leverage has been somewhat concentrated
on a relatively small number of players so far, but in an environment of laxer
credit standards there is a risk of it becoming more generalised.
The boom in private equity intensified in the past year. There was a further
increase in the number of private equity deals completed and, importantly, in

the average size of transactions (see Chapter VI). Private equity funds targeted
larger companies, often pooling their resources in consortia. Increased activity
was matched by enhanced performance (Graph VII.7), although arguably the
latter largely reflected previous investment decisions. As a result, funds were
able to raise near record sums of capital from investors seeking higher yields,
including many pension funds and funds of hedge funds. Few of the larger
funds have issued, or are interested in issuing, public equity in order to gain
access to a permanent source of capital.
Easy financing has played a key role in the private equity boom. Funds
have issued record levels of debt to finance these deals. The volume of
international syndicated loans related to leveraged buyouts (LBOs) increased
by 70% last year. While the strongest growth was registered in the United
States, the majority of loans were granted to European borrowers (Graph VII.8,
left-hand panel). Reported leverage in such transactions has been trending
upwards, as funds have been able to access financing on easier terms,
including through contracts with covenants that are considerably less restrictive
for the borrower. Together, these factors have led to a surge in speculative
grade loans, which account for 90% of all LBO loans arranged over the last
two years (Graph VII.8, right-hand panel).
The levels of leverage employed in private equity transactions have
raised questions about their longer-term sustainability. Acquired companies’
capital structures are altered through so-called “leveraged recapitalisations”,
which flatter the acquirer’s income at the expense of the target’s equity.
This is a key component of funds’ financial strategy and can partly account for
their strong performance. However, the strategy depends on the availability
of cheap funding, and the financial health of the acquired companies (and
associated debt) would be the most vulnerable in the event of a worsening
in the credit or business environment. While the releveraging appears to
be largely confined to the targeted companies (see Chapter VI), there are
concerns that expanding LBO activity will create pressures for companies
to increase debt levels more generally, either as a defence against being

Another concern is the relative opacity of the companies that have been
taken private. Reduced disclosure requirements for companies that are not
listed in public markets restrict public scrutiny of their management, while
the growing size of the acquisitions puts a premium on the adequacy of
governance structures in private companies.
Similar worries relate to the activities of hedge funds. Higher levels of
leverage (Graph VII.3) combined with relative opaqueness have raised
concerns that any future problems in the sector could spread widely across
the financial system. Counterparties may have underestimated the riskiness of
individual funds and the overall fragility of markets where the funds are active.

… opaqueness

The credit cycle
Given the key role that a benign credit environment has been playing in
boosting the performance of the financial sector over the past years, a turn
in the credit cycle represents a significant risk to its outlook. Investment
strategies that are predicated on continuing low spreads and rising asset
prices are critically exposed to an increased incidence of defaults. The way the
credit cycle interacts with overall macroeconomic conditions will determine
the challenges to financial stability over the medium term.
Low and declining credit costs have been a major feature of financial
firms’ performance. The level of non-performing loans in bank portfolios has
been at historical lows in many countries (Graph VII.9) and, coupled with low
provisioning, has contributed to banks’ high profitability. Together with
low interest rates, the benign credit environment has supported the supply of
funding that has been the driving force behind the buoyancy of structured
credit product markets and leveraged financing activity.
In many respects, these conditions could be characterised as exceptional
from the perspective of recent business cycle experience. The long period of

Dealing with higher
credit risk …

… depends on ex
ante discipline

economic growth that started in the mid-1990s was interrupted only briefly by
the relatively mild slowdown in the early part of this decade following the
bursting of the technology bubble. During this episode, the financial system
was able to deal effectively with a spate of corporate defaults thanks to growing
demand for credit by households and the beneficial impact of strengthened
credit risk transfer mechanisms.
A turn in the credit cycle is arguably within the expectations of market
observers, although its timing would be hard to predict. Signs of strain in
housing finance markets have multiplied, primarily in the United States, and
household indebtedness remains a concern in many jurisdictions as retail loan
delinquencies have risen. While corporate defaults are still very low (see
Chapter VI), the sustainability of higher debt levels would in some cases
be at risk in the event of a worsening of business conditions or a less
accommodating supply of credit.
A general question regarding the ability of banks to weather potential
strains from a turn in the cycle, possibly associated with a broader slowdown
in economic activity, relates to the discipline they have shown in their lending
standards. A favourable environment has encouraged more aggressive
lending practices in some segments, such as mortgages to high-risk borrowers.
More generally, the risk sensitivity of loan pricing appears to have increased
in recent years. Syndicated loan spreads appear to have widened compared
to bond spreads over the past year and to have become more sensitive to
credit risk (Graph VII.10). This is a positive sign, although the stock of richly
priced debt accumulated over the earlier part of the decade may become a
source of risk to lenders’ portfolios as these loans mature. Dealing with higher
default rates in a changing environment may create incentives for some form
of forbearance with respect to existing borrowers, further weakening the asset
quality of lenders and curtailing the supply of new credits.

The internationalisation of banking
The growth in international banking activity has been a major structural trend
in industrial economies for the last few decades. Initially, banks’ international
expansion mainly took the form of cross-border business. More recently,
though, banks have increasingly established a direct presence in foreign
jurisdictions. This trend has brought a number of benefits to both exporters
and importers of financial services in the form of greater diversification,
access to broader sources of funds and transfer of know-how. At the same
time, however, it has presented a number of policy challenges for both home
and host authorities in terms of how to assess and address financial sector
risks and in terms of overall macroeconomic management.

Trends and patterns
The international component of banks’ activities has been growing steadily
over the past 30 years. International claims of banks located in industrial
economies rose at an average annual rate of 11.5% between 1977 and 2006.
Over the past 10 years the pace has accelerated, exceeding 18% in the most
recent year. Measured against economic activity, these claims have quintupled
since 1980, reaching the equivalent of 50% of world GDP by 2006. The rate of
growth has not been uniform, with the data showing pronounced cycles in
activity. However, the current pace of growth has only been exceeded twice
since the mid-1970s.
This progressive internationalisation has been driven to a large extent by
the factors that have supported the general globalisation of business and trade.
Financing the needs of booming cross-border economic activity and following
banks’ traditional customers in their international ventures have been important
motivations for the development of international banking activity. Moreover,
greater capital account liberalisation has allowed borrowers to receive funding

through foreign-based intermediaries. In many national markets, foreignheadquartered banks contribute a large and increasing share of total credit to
non-bank borrowers, either directly from abroad or through their local offices
(Graph VII.11). Among the major industrial economies, foreign banks account
for a higher share of total credit in the United States, the United Kingdom
and the euro area than in Japan. In emerging market economies, where
privatisation and consolidation have altered the banking landscape, foreign
bank participation has risen markedly in Latin America and Europe, albeit with
substantial differences between individual countries.
In addition, a number of structural factors, more specific to the financial
industry, have elevated international expansion to an independent objective
of banking firms. Advances in communications and computing technology
and innovations in financial markets, as well as advances in the measurement
and management of financial risk, have helped many banks extend the
scope and scale of their business. These developments have facilitated
the increase in international activities by lowering their cost. At the same time,
as the limits to domestic growth were being reached because of declining
returns on investment and anti-monopoly regulations, international expansion
presented the most promising avenue for those institutions seeking balance
sheet growth.
It is not easy to describe global patterns in banking internationalisation.
Experiences differ across countries and banks, owing partly to the influence of
historical and institutional factors, and partly to differences in the underlying
structure and development of the respective economies. Nevertheless, it is
useful to review some broad characteristics of the internationalisation
process. These relate to the choice between establishing a local presence
abroad and providing banking services across borders, the associated
patterns of funding and lending in local currency, and the growing size of the
interbank markets, together with the role of banking centres in channelling
international flows.

An important aspect of the international activities of banks is whether they
are conducted through local offices in the foreign jurisdiction or cross-border
from the home office. The relative importance of international credit channelled
through local offices varies significantly across countries and over time. In the
late 1990s, international banks’ lending through local offices accounted for
about one quarter of claims vis-à-vis borrowers abroad (Graph VII.12). There
was, however, considerable diversity depending on the country of the borrower.
Foreign banks tended to favour a local presence in the United States and
Japan, while they seemed to opt for cross-border lending within the euro area.
The diversity across emerging market economies was much less pronounced.
In most regions, there has been a consistent upward trend in favour of local
presence. Among advanced industrial economies this has been particularly
evident in the United States, where lending through local offices has risen to
about 60% of total international claims. By contrast, despite the introduction
of the single currency, there has been little discernible increase in cross-border
establishment of banks within the euro area. The growing importance of local
presence has been most pronounced among emerging market economies.
Over the course of the current decade, the share of claims channelled
through local offices has grown to more than 40% of the total. Financial
sector liberalisation and privatisations, in many cases in the aftermath of
financial crises, have facilitated the opening of branches or the acquisition of
local banks. Even so, the aggregates conceal considerable variation across
individual countries, owing to idiosyncratic factors. During the past decade,
foreign bank ownership has risen most notably in the Americas and among
emerging and transition economies in Europe, and less so in Asia, Africa and
the Middle East. This reflects a broader trend whereby an increasing fraction
of mergers and acquisitions in the financial industry are cross-border, both in
industrial and in emerging market economies. As a result, a number of banking
systems are now effectively foreign-owned, as in New Zealand, Mexico and
some central and eastern European countries.

… a shift towards

… increased
reliance on local

… growing
interbank activity …

The shift from cross-border banking towards the creation of international
banking organisations can be seen in the extent to which their local claims are
locally funded. Foreign banks increasingly serve foreign markets by having
their offices raise deposits locally, substituting for cross-border liabilities or local
liabilities in foreign currency. Local funding in industrial economies amounts
on average to about 80% of local claims in local currency. While local offices in
the United Kingdom have tended to overfund local sterling lending with local
sterling deposits, the opposite has been the case for banking offices in Japan.
In emerging market economies, an upward trend in local funding could be
discerned during the late 1990s (Graph VII.13). This trend was especially evident
in Europe and Asia, perhaps in response to vulnerabilities exposed during the
Asian crisis. It has since reversed along with the incidence of currency crises.
A strategy of balanced increases in local assets and liabilities may reflect a
number of motivations, such as more emphasis on retail banking (offering mortgages and credit cards to local depositors) or reduced vulnerability to currency
mismatches and transfer risk. Local assets and liabilities will tend to increase
in parallel, whether foreign banks grow their local operations organically or
engage in cross-border acquisitions of banks with an existing depositor base.
Exposures to other banks represent the lion’s share of international bank
assets and liabilities, accounting for over 60% of the total. The interbank
segment of the international banking market has steadily expanded in most
countries, both in absolute volume and relative to domestic monetary
aggregates (Graph VII.14, left-hand panel). International interbank activity is
particularly important for European banks, especially those domiciled within the
euro area. With the advent of the euro the interbank deposit market within
the single currency area received a major boost, becoming a key channel for
the efficient allocation of liquidity. By contrast, the prolonged weakness of
Japanese banks has led to a shrinking of their participation in the international
interbank market since the mid-1990s.

While the international banking market is fairly diffused across
jurisdictions, a small number of international banking hubs play a key role
in the overall distribution of funds. These centres are characterised by a
high percentage of international banking activity conducted by foreignheadquartered institutions. The dominant shares of the United Kingdom and
the United States in interbank activity mirror the role of London and New York
as international financial centres. The United Kingdom, in particular, attracts
over 20% of global interbank deposits, with foreign banks accounting for more
than 70% of the overall international banking activity in this jurisdiction
(Graph VII.14, right-hand panel). In addition, a number of countries, including
Asian and Caribbean offshore centres, have established themselves as
regional hubs, playing an important role in intermediating banking flows
between regions.

Policy challenges
The internationalisation of financial intermediation brings benefits for home and
host economy alike, but it also presents a number of challenges for individual
institutions as well as for home and host country policymakers. Home and host
financial systems benefit from banks that are better diversified, on both the
assets and liabilities side of their balance sheets, and from a potentially more
stable source of financing for economic activity. The challenges are both
microeconomic and macroeconomic in nature. They relate to the management
of the different types of risk that arise as a result of the greater complexity of banks
with international operations. Assessing the performance and vulnerabilities
of internationally active institutions and the stability of open financial systems
requires cooperation between authorities in sharing information and coordinating
policy interventions, often in the context of asymmetric incentives.

The trend poses
challenges to banks
and policymakers

Micro
At the level of the individual institution, the greater internationalisation of
banks’ operations brings about a greater degree of complexity. The conduct
of cross-border business requires operations to be adapted to differing client,
market and prudential cultures, and also coordinated across different units
within the organisation. Meshing corporate cultures, harmonising practices and
creating an effective reporting and control structure are key success factors.
The fact that in some cases foreign units were previously independent entities
may complicate the task.
The challenges for the authorities in charge of the prudential oversight of
internationally active banks are similar in scope, albeit different in nature. They
revolve around the differences in perspective between the home and host
authorities. Monitoring of performance and assessment of the risk profile of
these institutions depend critically on the availability of sufficient information
regarding overall activities and business practices. This task naturally includes
forming a view on the risks associated with international exposures or
mismatches in the maturity and currency composition of an institution’s overall
balance sheet. Cooperation between home and host authorities in sharing
information, views and specific local knowledge is a key component of an

complex …

… and more difficult

… and to manage

effective monitoring mechanism. Similarly, differences in the design and
application of prudential tools in the various jurisdictions can conflict with the
bank’s attempt to manage its business on an integrated basis, taking
advantage of synergies and diversification opportunities. Differences in the
classification rules for non-performing assets and provisioning requirements
are a case in point.
Complexity also interferes with the effectiveness of intervention when
the bank comes under stress. Assessing the solvency of a bank depends on
forming precise views about the current and prospective value of its assets
and liabilities. The timely and accurate evaluation of illiquid or opaque items
often benefits from local supervisory expertise. This highlights the importance
of open channels of communication between the authorities in different
jurisdictions. Moreover, access to emergency support will be subject to
potentially different practices and conflicting incentives of various authorities
which would prefer that national resources not be put at risk in support of
foreign operations and foreign creditors of the bank.
The resolution of crises is also complicated by the fact that decisions
concerning the workout process, in the event of a failure, will also be
influenced by national interests and differences in perspective of the parties
involved. To what extent intermediation capacity should be preserved in the
host jurisdiction could well be a point of contention. So too could be the sharing
of the financial burden via the commitment of public funds. The issues become
particularly complex when the distribution of the affected bank’s international
activities gives rise to asymmetric perspectives among the authorities involved.
This would be the case when, for example, the operations in the host country
are small in comparison to the size of the international bank, but systemically
important when compared to the size of the local economy. The two authorities
may then have sharply different views on the issue of closure.

Macro
Internationalisation …

… may complicate
monetary policy …

The growing internationalisation of banking also presents challenges from the
point of view of macroeconomic management, both in the traditional sense of
control of liquidity and credit flows by the monetary authority and in the sense
of ensuring the overall stability of the financial system.
The ability of internationally active banks to manage liquidity and balance
sheets across the jurisdictions in which they operate may at times weaken the
effectiveness of monetary policy instruments. Easier access to funding from
abroad facilitates banks’ ability to pursue high-yielding opportunities in periods
of persistent international interest rate differentials. Aggressive lending
strategies may also increase the supply of credit to households and businesses
at lower interest rates, but at a much elevated exchange rate risk, which is
more difficult to appreciate. These practices can weaken the power of
monetary policy instruments and frustrate the authorities’ pursuit of policy
objectives. The experience in central and eastern European economies is a
notable example. Until recently, credit expansion had defied the efforts of
central banks to stem it, and this has boosted domestic demand, supported
buoyant housing prices and contributed to rising current account deficits.

BIS 77th Annual Report

137

Similarly, from a macroprudential perspective, internationally active banks
present challenges to policy efforts aimed at financial stability. As regards the
monitoring of vulnerabilities, these challenges are relatively balanced between
home and host authorities. Both need to evaluate potential scenarios that
involve developments in the economies where domestically active banks have
important operations. By contrast, the application of prudential tools in leaning
against imprudent practices comes up against control and incentive issues.
Locally applied measures may be ineffective if largely international institutions
represent a major share of domestic banking activity. And coordination
between prudential authorities can be hampered because of differences in
perspective if the host country operations are only a small component of
the overall activities of these institutions. In addition, the management and
resolution of systemic crises has to confront the obstacles highlighted above in
the case of individual institutions, namely the availability of high-quality and
timely information, legal and operational complexity, and conflicting interests of
participating authorities. The situation is further complicated by misalignments
between the claims on the institutions’ resources from different authorities and
the distribution of any fiscal costs of the workout.
In view of these policy challenges, efforts are being made to create
structures that facilitate the risk assessment of internationally active banking
firms and enhance crisis management. Concrete examples include setting up
bilateral and multilateral mechanisms in the form of regular forums, and
establishing templates and other communication channels to aid the joint
assessment of the performance of these banks. Often these efforts are
formalised as memoranda of understanding between the relevant authorities,
but they can also have a more informal, although not necessarily less useful,
character. The development of global regulatory standards is an important
step towards achieving greater coherence in prudential frameworks across
jurisdictions. While standards relate to the design of regulatory instruments,
such as capital and provisioning rules, they also contribute to the formation of
a common supervisory culture by establishing best practice in their application.
Finally, structures that have been put in place to improve the flow of
information for monitoring purposes have also been used to discuss and plan
action in the event of systemic stress. These discussions may be necessarily
more informal given the complexity of the issues and concerns about moral
hazard.
Despite the progress made so far, many aspects require further work.
This is not only due to the complex circumstances of particular banks or
the institutional framework prevailing in specific jurisdictions. It also reflects
the fact that the nature of the policy challenges is changing as the economics
of cross-border banking evolve.

VIII. Conclusion: prevention rather than cure?

Economics is not a science, at least not in the sense that repeated experiments
always produce the same results. Thus, economic forecasts are often widely
off the mark, particularly at cyclical turning points, with inadequate data,
deficient models and random shocks often conspiring to produce unsatisfactory
outcomes. Even trickier is the task of assigning probabilities to the risks
surrounding forecasts. Indeed, this is so difficult that it is scarcely an
exaggeration to say that we face a fundamentally uncertain world – one in
which probabilities cannot be calculated – rather than simply a risky one.
Economic history is a useful guide in this respect. The Great Inflation in
the 1970s took most commentators and policymakers completely by surprise,
as did the pace of disinflation and the subsequent economic recovery after the
problem was effectively confronted. Similarly, virtually no one foresaw
the Great Depression of the 1930s, or the crises which affected Japan and
Southeast Asia in the early and late 1990s, respectively. In fact, each downturn
was preceded by a period of non-inflationary growth exuberant enough to
lead many commentators to suggest that a “new era” had arrived. Similar
surprises can be noted at a more micro level. Around the time of the failure
of LTCM in 1998, the firm faced price shocks in various markets that
were almost 10 times larger than might reasonably have been expected based
on previous history. As a result, its fundamental assumptions – that it was
adequately diversified, had ample liquidity and was well capitalised – all
proved disastrously wrong.
Of course, many will say that our understanding of economic processes
has improved thanks to this experience. Yet this is not such an easy
proposition to prove. Consider, for example, the typical way in which central
bank economists forecast future inflation using econometric models of how
wages and prices interact. To do this accurately, at least five questions have
to be answered correctly. What is the best way to measure excess capacity in
the domestic economy? What is the trend rate of growth of productivity?
Are foreign influences limited to import prices alone? Are wages driven
by forward-looking price expectations, or by past price developments? If
expectations are important, are they influenced by the credibility of central
banks or by something else, like actual or even perceived inflation? Each
of these questions is currently highly contentious. And when we turn to
other economic variables, the degree of disagreement about many equally
fundamental issues is just as great.
Indeed, in the light of massive and ongoing structural changes, it is not
hard to argue that our understanding of economic processes may even be less
today than it was in the past. On the real side of the economy, a combination of
technological progress and globalisation has revolutionised production. On the
financial side, new players, new instruments and new attitudes have proven

BIS 77th Annual Report

139

equally revolutionary. And on the monetary side, increasingly independent
central banks have changed dramatically in terms of both how they act and
how they communicate with the public. In the midst of all this change, could
anyone seriously contend that it is business as usual?
There is, moreover, a special uncertainty in the area of monetary policy.
While the commitment of central bankers to the pursuit of price stability has
never been stronger, the role played by money and credit is being increasingly
debated, against the backdrop of the uncertainty about the inflation process
referred to above. For some central banks, and indeed many leading
academics, neither money nor credit is thought to play any useful role in the
conduct of monetary policy. For others, in contrast, the too rapid growth
of such aggregates could be either a harbinger of inflation or the sign of a
financially driven boom-bust cycle with its own unwelcome characteristics.
Against this background, neither central banks nor the markets are likely
to be infallible in their judgments. This has important implications. The
implication for markets is that they must continue to do their own independent
thinking. Simply looking into the mirror of the central banks’ convictions could
well prove a dangerous strategy. The implication for policymakers is that they
should continue to work on improving the resilience of the system to inevitable
but unexpected shocks.

Topics of current concern to policymakers
The consensus forecast for the global economy, which is obtained through a
poll of economists, anticipates that recent high levels of growth will continue,
that global inflation will stay quite subdued, and that global current account
imbalances will gradually moderate. With respect to financial markets, the
consensus forecast for 2007 is that long rates will stay around current levels.
Evidently, and appropriately, this forecast implicitly assumes that there will be
no major geopolitical disruptions and no disturbances in the financial sector
significant enough to affect the real economy.
As a near-term proposition, a forecast that says the future will be a lot like
the past has much to recommend it. Indeed, looking closely at forecast errors
in recent years, one might conclude that there are grounds for even greater
optimism. Real growth has, on the whole, been stronger than expected, while
inflation has generally stayed in line with predictions, despite sharp increases
in commodity prices in the last year or so. Long-term interest rates have also
consistently come in below anticipated levels. Since it is well known that
forecast errors often display a significant degree of persistence, one might
with some confidence expect the good news to continue. Only with respect to
global trade imbalances have the actual outturns been markedly worse than
expected, but even here, as noted in the Introduction to this Annual Report,
there are some signs of improvement.
Yet it is not difficult to identify uncertainties that could conceivably cause
this near-term forecast to come unstuck, or that could result in less welcome
outcomes over a longer horizon. Below, various areas of concern are identified
and analysed separately, although they could well be interdependent. As

140

BIS 77th Annual Report

will be described in the following section, those who are more focused on
such interdependencies tend to see accommodative financial conditions as
the causal thread linking these areas of concern together.
A first uncertainty has to do with the possible resurgence of global inflation
and, potentially, inflation expectations. Estimates of capacity gaps in most of
the major industrial countries indicate that they are approaching or have
reached the limits of their potential. Disinflation pressures originating in
emerging market economies also seem to be easing in the wake of sometimes
extraordinary domestic growth rates. In China, in particular, it has become
increasingly clear over the last few months that measures to slow the economy
have not been effective so far. Partially as a result, continued strong increases
in global energy and other commodity prices show no signs of abating, and
questions are being raised about the ongoing capacity of companies to offset
these higher costs through savings elsewhere. Finally, the fact that monetary
and credit aggregates have also been growing very rapidly, not least in
countries such as China that use foreign exchange intervention to resist
currency appreciation, is a further worrisome sign for many.
Given the still pivotal role of the United States in the world economy, the
possible inflationary impact of cyclically rising wages and declining productivity
growth is a source of near-term uncertainty. In addition, two medium-term
considerations need to be taken into account. The ratio of house prices to rents
is at an all-time high. Unless house prices fall significantly, a renormalisation
would imply a prospective rise in rents which would feed directly into the
measured CPI. Moreover, if global trade imbalances need to be resolved, a
further and perhaps substantial decline in the dollar might also be part of the
adjustment process. To date, shrinking foreign margins, allied with productivity
increases, have sufficed to keep exchange rate pass-through to a minimum in
the United States. Whether this will continue remains to be seen.
Viewed in this light, the recent slowing in the US economy must be judged
welcome. Yet, as 2006 wore on, concerns began to mount that this might turn
into rather too much of a good thing. The attention of financial markets first
focused on the US subprime mortgage market, but the underlying issue is
much broader. The household saving rate in the United States fell for a time
into negative territory, as sluggish wage growth failed to provide adequate
support for a sharp increase in consumer spending and residential investment.
Easy credit terms, especially in the mortgage market, encouraged both higher
debt levels and higher house prices. The latter, in turn, provided both the
collateral to justify more lending, and the perception of increased wealth to
justify more spending.
The concern is that this might all reverse. Debt service levels are already
elevated and mortgage rates might rise further. House prices only need to
stop rising (indeed, this may already have happened) to slow both the
recourse to credit and the sense of confidence arising from increases in
wealth. Moreover, when cuts in construction jobs begin to match the much
larger fall in housing starts to date, then wage income, job security and
confidence could be further affected. Were corporate fixed investment, already
inexplicably weak given high profits and low financing costs, to retreat as well,

BIS 77th Annual Report

141

then the stage might be set for a more significant and perhaps unwelcome
deceleration in US growth.
If this is the risk, it must also be recorded that the ratio of US household
debt to income has been creeping up for decades without seriously
compromising consumer confidence. Consumer spending could also get a
second wind from faster wage increases. The wage share is secularly low and
might rebound. Moreover, the United States is at that “late cycle” stage, when
unemployment is low and compensation normally tends to rise. However,
this possibility could have undesirable implications as well. As noted above,
inflation pressures might increase, or, if wage demands instead cut into profit
margins, stock market expectations could be disappointed, with possible
implications for both asset prices and corporate investment.
Were the US economy to slow substantially, the crucial question would
be how others might be affected. On the one hand, domestic demand has
recently gained strength in the euro area and Japan, as well as in a number
of emerging market economies. Furthermore, unlike the IT-related slowdown
around the turn of the century, there has not been a synchronised industrial
boom that might suddenly collapse at the global level. Support for continued
global growth is also provided by the falling share of exports to the United
States, in a context of surging world trade overall.
On the other hand, in both Germany and Japan the revival of domestic
demand has been overwhelmingly in the form of corporate investment, itself
driven by strong export demand. The same can be said for China, where the
growth rate of the economy has been characterised by Premier Wen Jiabao as
“unstable, unbalanced, uncoordinated and unsustainable”. Moreover, even
without a synchronised business cycle, boardroom confidence globally might
be affected by a sharp US downturn. And while direct exports to the United
States might have fallen relative to global totals, a major component of the
latter has been imports for assembly in China. In this regard, the indirect
exposure of many countries in Asia to slower US growth might still be
significant. Finally, it is notable that the United States is by no means alone
in its dependence on debt-fuelled consumption, with some countries even
having substantially negative household saving rates. This provides a further
channel for possible contagion.
To near-term uncertainties about inflation and growth must be added a
number of medium-term concerns, not least persistent and substantial global
trade imbalances. Does this constitute a problem, requiring a policy response
to lower the possibility of large and perhaps abrupt movements in exchange
rates? Or, rather, can we assume that the capital inflows needed to finance such
deficits will be available on not significantly different terms for the foreseeable
future?
Countries with large trade deficits are generally those where domestic
demand has been growing relatively fast, and where interest rates are
relatively high in consequence. In principle, such countries should also have
depreciating currencies. This would allow external deficits to be reduced over
time as domestic demand began to ease under the influence of higher rates.
Unfortunately, in practice, relatively high interest rates often induce private

142

BIS 77th Annual Report

capital inflows of such a magnitude as to cause the exchange rate to
appreciate rather than depreciate, and to raise domestic asset prices, which
leads to more spending rather than less. Both these developments will cause
the trade deficit to worsen further. This process was very much part of the story
in the United States prior to 2001, and the second element of it continues
today. Moreover, in recent years there have been a number of variations on
this “carry trade” theme, with still more dramatic effects on smaller economies
like New Zealand and a number of countries in central and eastern Europe. In
many of these countries, including some where fundamentals have significantly
improved, fears have been rising that a sudden reversal of such capital flows
might significantly complicate macroeconomic management.
The US trade deficit is of a very special nature, largely because of the
dollar’s role as a reserve currency. Thus, the significant reduction of private
sector capital inflows after 2001 was counterbalanced by inflows from the
public sector, leading to only a gradual decline in the value of the dollar. This
has had the advantage of being quite manageable, but the disadvantage is that
there has been no discernible reduction in the US trade deficit. When we add to
this the gradual movement of the service account into deficit, and the growing
size of the external debt position, the dollar clearly remains vulnerable to a
sudden loss of private sector confidence, and presumably associated increases
in risk premia in financial markets. While to some degree this would be
welcome, as part of the external adjustment process, it could at the same time
aggravate both near-term inflation pressures and the risks of a more serious
downturn.
The reliability of public sector inflows has also become more uncertain,
for at least two reasons. First, countries outside the United States might now
be increasingly inclined to reduce intervention and let their currencies rise.
Reasons for this might include a desire to limit the losses arising from an evergrowing currency exposure. But, likely to be of greater importance, there is
mounting evidence of the domestic distortions associated with both currency
intervention and easy monetary policies whose effect has been to hold down
exchange rates. Authorities in China, Japan and some commodity-producing
countries have already publicly expressed strong concern about excessive
capital investments, and possible resource misallocations, in their respective
countries. And, as noted above, in a number of countries inflationary pressures
are rising and sterilisation seems to be becoming increasingly difficult.
The second potential threat is that holders of large portfolios of reserves
might begin to reduce the proportion of new reserves held in US dollars. On
the one hand, the principle of uncovered interest parity implies that, over
sufficiently long time horizons, returns will not be increased by such a strategy.
This would argue against the rebalancing of portfolios still primarily held in
dollars. On the other hand, the variance of such returns, measured in domestic
currency, could be reduced if the currency composition of the reserve portfolio
were chosen with this end in mind. Whether concerns about the variability of
returns would provide sufficient motivation for a significant reduction in the
proportion of dollar holdings remains an open question. So too does the issue
of whether such official actions would materially affect exchange rates, barring

BIS 77th Annual Report

143

widespread imitation by the private sector. What is more certain is that, as
reserve managers increasingly focus on maximising returns, they will be
attracted to the currencies of countries that give them ready access to equity
and other instruments that allow them to do so.
A final set of medium-term uncertainties has to do with potential
vulnerabilities in financial markets and possible knock-on effects on financial
institutions. As noted in the Introduction, the prices of virtually all assets have
been trending upwards, almost without interruption, since the middle of 2003.
For some commentators, it is not hard to find plausible reasons why individual
asset price increases are justified and therefore more likely to be sustainable.
For example, the very low risk spreads on sovereign issues are consistent with
clear improvements in governance and macroeconomic policies in many
countries. Comparably low spreads on high-risk corporates reflect high profits
and very low default rates in recent years. Unusually low term premia could be
the result of the absence of volatility in the major macro variables for some
time. The prices of commodities and fine art reflect new sources of demand
from newly emerging markets. And the increase in house prices, which has
now become almost a global phenomenon, can be ascribed to lower longterm mortgage rates.
Yet it could also be suggested, consistent with the inherent difficulty of
making longer-term valuations, that the market reaction to good news might
have become irrationally exuberant. There seems to be a natural tendency in
markets for past successes to lead to more risk-taking, more leverage, more
funding, higher prices, more collateral and, in turn, more risk-taking. One
manifestation of this, over the last few years, has been that the intermittent
periods of financial volatility have become progressively shorter. Apparently,
the observed resilience of markets to successive shocks has increasingly
encouraged the view that lower prices constitute a buying opportunity. The
danger with such endogenous market processes is that they can, indeed must,
eventually go into reverse if the fundamentals have been overpriced. Moreover,
should liquidity dry up and correlations among asset prices rise, the concern
would be that prices might also overshoot on the downside. Such cycles have
been seen many times in the past.
The obvious question is: who might be hurt by such a turn of events? The
big investment and commercial banks seem very well capitalised, and many
have been making record profits. Their attention to risk management issues
has also been unprecedented. Yet some sources of concern must already have
been identified by the markets, since the spreads on credit default swaps for
some of the best known names have recently been elevated in comparison to
the levels that would be normal given their credit ratings. One area of concern
is market risk and leverage. Balance sheets have grown significantly. Moreover,
value-at-risk measures have stayed constant even though measured volatility
has fallen substantially. Another possible worry, linked to the “originate and
distribute” strategy, is that originators might be stuck with a warehouse of
depreciating assets in turbulent times. The fact that banks are now increasingly
providing bridge equity, along with bridge loans, to support the still growing
number of corporate mergers and acquisitions, is not a good sign. A closely

144

BIS 77th Annual Report

related concern is the possibility that banks have, either intentionally or
inadvertently, retained a significant degree of credit risk on their books.
Assuming that the big banks have managed to distribute more widely the
risks inherent in the loans they have made, who now holds these risks, and
can they manage them adequately? The honest answer is that we do not know.
Much of the risk is embodied in various forms of asset-backed securities of
growing complexity and opacity. They have been purchased by a wide range
of smaller banks, pension funds, insurance companies, hedge funds, other funds
and even individuals, who have been encouraged to invest by the generally
high ratings given to these instruments. Unfortunately, the ratings reflect only
expected credit losses, and not the unusually high probability of tail events
that could have large effects on market values. Hedge funds might be most
exposed, since many have tended to specialise in purchases of the riskiest
sorts of these instruments, and their inherent leverage can in consequence be
very high.
It is not, by definition, possible to put all these uncertainties together
and arrive at a prediction. Rather, if one believes that a range of possible
developments could all interact in various ways, such interactions could form
the basis of a thousand stories. Yet it must be noted that behind each set of
concerns lurks the common factor of the highly accommodating financial
conditions noted in the Introduction. While this observation need not call into
question the consensus forecast as such, it should at least serve to remind us
that tail events affecting the global economy might at some point have much
higher costs than is commonly supposed.

Challenges in formulating a policy response
There are a number of difficult and important questions facing central
bankers, to which there are no agreed answers. A first issue has to do with the
appropriate role of monetary and credit aggregates in the formulation of
monetary policy. A second issue is closely related: assuming that occasional
credit-driven boom-bust cycles are possible, should the public sector seek to
prevent the build-up of imbalances, or rather just clean up afterwards?
Concerning the first issue, three schools of thought can be identified, each
with at least some adherents in most central banks. A first school emphasises
the short-run effects on inflation of gaps between aggregate demand and
supply, with longer-run inflation trends being largely determined by expectations
about such gaps. The role of money and credit is generally played down by this
group. A second school attaches more importance to monetary developments
in influencing longer-run trends in inflation. In practice, this would imply a
continuing emphasis on the influence of demand-supply gaps on inflation,
but with policy conclusions being systematically cross-checked against the
monetary data. Finally, a third school of thought also attributes great importance
to monetary, but above all credit, developments, albeit for a rather different
reason. Adherents of this school become concerned when they see rapid
growth of the aggregates along with rising asset prices, particularly if also
associated with substantial and sustained deviations of spending patterns

BIS 77th Annual Report

145

from traditional norms. They admit that the medium-term outcome could
be rising inflation, but fear rather more that a boom-bust cycle might have
significant economic costs, potentially including unwelcome deflation over a
longer-term horizon.
Both historical experience and intellectual fashion have played a role in
these divergences. Adherents of the first school would contend that forecasts
of inflation using gap methodology have proven reasonably accurate in many
countries over many years. Their refusal to countenance any more formal role
for money rests in part on the unsuccessful “monetarist” experiment of the
1970s, but also on the failure of econometric work to reveal a stable and causal
relationship with inflation in their countries. Supporters of the second school
of thought would note that their belief in the money-inflation nexus is deeply
rooted in theory. Moreover, the Deutsche Bundesbank and the Swiss National
Bank have been translating such beliefs into effective anti-inflationary policies
for decades. The third school of thought has been influenced not just by
pre-World War II business cycle theory but also by the wrenching historical
experience of the booms and busts referred to earlier.
While fashions come and go, it appears that the influence of the second
and third schools has been growing. In recent years, a number of central
banks, when raising policy rates, have cited concerns about very rapid
growth in both credit and asset prices. A number of other central banks have
announced their intention to lengthen their normal policy horizon, to allow
them to better evaluate the full range of possible effects arising from their
policies. Finally, almost everywhere, one hears reference being made to the
“normalisation” of policy rates, a concept which logically implies that
the appropriateness of policy cannot be judged on its short-run impact alone.
Behind this shift in thinking have been a number of influences.
Forecasting inflation using traditional methodologies has become more difficult
everywhere. Central banks are therefore looking for new guideposts, and these
include the use of monetary and credit aggregates. Indeed, research in some
central banks has recently identified what appears to be a reliable relationship
between their monetary aggregates and inflation over long periods. Moreover,
with the passage of time, new crises and the further analysis of old ones have
provided empirical evidence to support the specific arguments for concern
expressed by the third school. Finally, as evidence has accumulated that the
global economy is characterised both by many imbalances and by a flatter
short-run Phillips curve, the potential economic losses in a subsequent
downturn have also been revised upwards. In sum, the possible implications
of getting policy wrong have grown. All of these factors have helped to spur
debate, and even sometimes to change minds.
A second question, eliciting diverse answers, is how best to deal with
what seems to be the natural procyclicality of the financial system. Should
policy sometimes lean against an upturn, even in the absence of inflationary
pressures? And if so, how? Should it rather lean primarily against the
subsequent downturn, and if so how? Or, reflecting our lack of understanding,
and the shortcomings of each of the individual policy instruments we
currently possess, should it do both, using a number of policy instruments

146

BIS 77th Annual Report

simultaneously? Short of serious re-regulation of financial markets, which
would create many harmful inefficiencies over time, this more pragmatic
approach to procyclicality in the financial system might have much to
recommend it.
The principal argument for tightening monetary policy in the upswing is to
moderate the excesses in economic and financial behaviour and, in so doing,
contain the costs of the downturn. There are of course some significant
practical difficulties with this approach. How do policymakers evaluate when
imbalances are building up to such a size as to warrant action? What degree
of tightening would be required to moderate market euphoria, and might it do
serious harm to unaffected parts of the economy? These points have been
made repeatedly, and validly, in connection with the hurdles that central
bankers would face in targeting asset prices. But the suggestion being made
here is different. It is rather to react when a number of indicators – not just
asset prices but also credit growth and spending patterns – are simultaneously
behaving in a manner that indicates increasing exposures. In principle, such a
configuration of developments would be both rarer and easier to identify.
Moreover, the more widespread the euphoria, the less worry there will be that
tighter policy might inflict collateral damage on unaffected sectors.
That said, small, and increasingly not so small, open economies will have
a particular problem with this prescription if their relatively higher interest rates
attract substantial capital inflows. These can contribute in turn to both a sharply
higher exchange rate and more, rather than less, accommodative domestic
credit conditions. Both can, for a time, exacerbate the underlying imbalances of
concern to policymakers, as seen most recently in New Zealand and Thailand.
One desirable response might be tighter fiscal policy, but if this simply
increases confidence in the country, such a move might attract still more
inflows. In any event, fiscal tightening is not always easy to implement
politically, since unexpected tax receipts associated with such expansions
often make the government’s fiscal position look overly conservative to begin
with. Longer-term, recurrent difficulties of this sort could eventually call into
question the viability of some smaller currencies. In fact, this is consistent with
what happened in Europe after restrictions on international capital flows were
eased in the 1980s.
In the face of extreme difficulties of this sort, a number of smaller
economies have turned to the use of administrative instruments to promote
credit restraint. Various forms of capital controls, higher reserve requirements,
changes in risk weights, lower loan-to-value ratios and other measures have all
been tried, albeit with only limited success. In any event, all administrative
measures of this sort routinely invite evasion over time.
Nonetheless, these practical difficulties acknowledged, the potential costs
arising from the underlying problems emphasise the need for domestic
monetary and regulatory authorities to cooperate more systematically in the
future than they have tended to in the past. Preferably based on better
information than we have today about household, corporate and bank
exposures, agreement should be reached in advance about what the
respective policymakers might do to mitigate the risks associated with rising

BIS 77th Annual Report

147

credit exposure. Indeed, in some cases emerging difficulties might call for more
cooperation internationally, rather than just domestically. Consider the example
of central and eastern Europe. Most of the credit being granted there is coming
from commercial banks headquartered in western Europe. For virtually all of
these banks, there is no significant capital exposure involved. At the same
time, the macroeconomic exposure of the countries receiving the loans is rising
steadily.
In the light of all these difficulties associated with preventive action, it is
not surprising that there is also a second school of thought. It essentially
accepts that busts will happen, but argues that the associated costs can be
significantly moderated by vigorous monetary easing after the event. Indeed,
it might be noted that this approach has been used repeatedly over the last
20 years, not least in 2001, and seems to have worked reasonably well in
many cases.
Yet this second approach also has its shortcomings. The first is that it
might not always work. Consider the Japanese case as an example of “pushing
on a string”. Is it credible that a 15-year phase of weak economic performance
had its roots in the failure of the Bank of Japan to ease aggressively enough
in 1991? As a simple matter of fact, Japanese policy rates did come down very
sharply at that time, as indeed they did in the United States in 1930, to similar
limited effect. What is more credible as an explanation of stagnation in
the Japanese case is that the zero lower bound for policy rates proved an
important constraint, and that excessive investment and debt built up in the
good times weighed heavily on the economy for many years.
While the use of lower interest rates to sustain demand might still be
sensible, lower rates can also have unwelcome side effects if maintained for
too long. On the supply side of the economy, below-equilibrium interest rates
effectively transfer wealth from creditors to debtors, which will tend to lower
saving rates and economic potential over time. If “zombie” companies are
allowed to survive, continuing excess production capacity is likely to undercut
the profits and viability of other companies. On the financial side, easy
financing can also encourage mergers and acquisitions, as seen quite recently.
Not only does the historical record indicate that such takeovers often fail to
add value, but also the fear of takeovers could over time encourage a more
general gearing-up of the corporate sector as a means of self-insurance.
Within the financial sector, the search for yield might encourage imprudent
behaviour. All of these factors make the economy more vulnerable to shocks
over time. In effect, dealing with today’s problem of deficient demand through
sustained monetary accommodation can sow the seeds for more serious
problems further ahead.
Such reflections lead to the conclusion that the management of problems
through infusions of liquidity must, at the least, be complemented by more
concrete and fundamental efforts to promote the reduction of excess debt and
unprofitable investment built up in the earlier period. Companies whose
survival chances are not evident should be closed promptly, with shareholders
and managers paying the price. Other firms should then be allowed to find
alternative uses for what resources remain. Moreover, if the banking system is

148

BIS 77th Annual Report

seriously affected in turn, it should be restructured according to the sensible
principles laid out so clearly in response to the Nordic banking crises of the
early 1990s.
A complicating element, particularly in emerging market economies, is
that such restructuring requires a skill set that many countries do not possess.
Accountants, appraisers, lawyers and insolvency experts are all in short
supply. Moreover, in a number of countries, legal procedures are not yet
sufficiently developed to ensure speedy and final solutions, either using the
courts or through out-of-court procedures. It is not hard to imagine that such
shortcomings could in some countries strongly encourage forbearance in the
event of future crises. Clearly, attention should be paid to this issue as soon
as possible, since rectifying such deficiencies will certainly take time. It is of
course true that large financial firms in the advanced industrial countries are
currently trying to address such problems by assembling teams of workout
and bankruptcy specialists. So-called “vulture funds” are also increasingly in
evidence. However, whether this should be a source of solace or rather of
concern remains to be seen.

Where should policies go from here?
Now that a number of uncertainties have been laid out about prospective
economic and financial events, complicating the issue of how policy might best
respond, an unfortunate reality presents itself. Policy must still be made, and in
a forward-looking context. Fortunately, the current confluence of circumstances
is such that some recommendations can be hazarded. Broadly, they come
down to using today’s evident good times to prepare for a future that will, by
definition, be less certain.
With respect to monetary policies, those who are concerned with nearterm inflation as well as those concerned about a further build-up of mediumterm imbalances might welcome further tightening. Inflation pressures globally
seem to be increasing, while evidence of various imbalances continues to
mount almost everywhere. For those concerned about inflation pressures,
economies with external deficits, particularly the larger ones, should in principle
bear a particular responsibility for contributing to the moderation of global
demand growth. Those who are concerned about imbalances and resource
misallocations would note that China seems to have a particularly large
gap between actual interest rates and the “normal” rate determined by the
economy’s potential growth rate.
Japan has been facing persistent downward pressure on prices, but these
pressures increasingly reflect the positive supply side shocks seen elsewhere
in the world. This fact, together with secular improvements in the levels of
corporate debt and non-performing loans, implies that the potential for a
dangerous deflationary spiral has now been much reduced. The fact that the
economy seems to be growing robustly, and that capital outflows from Japan
might be having unwelcome effects elsewhere in the world, provides further
arguments for supporting the suggestion that the Bank of Japan should
continue to normalise interest rates gradually.

BIS 77th Annual Report

149

Both short-term and medium-term considerations should also guide the
path of fiscal policy in the same direction. Tighter fiscal policies could play a
role in moderating global demand growth, although the dangers of fine-tuning
in this regard are not negligible. But, to adopt a longer view, both government
deficits and debts have been described as troublingly high in many countries.
Moreover, countries with twin deficits, fiscal and external, might reap particular
benefits from further steps towards fiscal consolidation. This could serve to
reduce risk premia, the likelihood of disruptive capital flight in the event of
future economic setbacks, and of course the attendant possibility of sharp
movements in foreign exchange markets.
While, in general, large economies with floating exchange rates should
continue to let them float freely, there is clearly something anomalous in the
ongoing decline in the external value of the yen. Tighter monetary policies
would help to redress this situation, but the underlying problem seems to be a
too firm conviction on the part of investors that the yen will not be allowed to
strengthen in any significant way. As a counterweight, investors might be better
encouraged to consider the autumn of 1998, when the yen rose by more than
10% against the US dollar in the space of two days, inflicting sizeable losses
on those involved in the carry trade business.
There should also be a greater willingness to let the renminbi rise, even
though one recognises the formidable internal challenges this will pose to the
Chinese authorities. Such a move would also allow other Asian currencies to
move up further against the US dollar, again contributing to a reduction in
global trade imbalances. While some in China seem to believe that the source
of Japan’s recent problems lay in allowing the yen to rise in the late 1980s, this
is a misreading of history. The seeds of the Japanese bust were actually sown
in the preceding, rampant monetary expansion designed to keep the yen down.
Moreover, given the recent rates of credit expansion, asset price increases and
massive investments in heavy industry, the Chinese economy also seems to be
demonstrating very similar, disquieting symptoms.
Currently buoyant economic and financial conditions should also provide
support for structural reforms that would enhance growth worldwide. Perhaps
the greatest challenge with respect to the real economy is to facilitate the
shift into non-tradable services in countries that currently have large trade
surpluses, in particular China and Japan. By the same token, a shift into
tradables is needed in the United States, to help reduce its current account
deficit.
The problem at the moment is that the allocation of resources in all three
countries has been moving resolutely in the wrong direction. In China and Japan,
investment is still in large part focused on export markets. Moreover, should
there be an economic shock affecting the Asian region, there is a reasonable
chance that export markets would be relied upon even more heavily to maintain
employment growth. The threat posed by rising protectionist pressures in
western countries would clearly be exacerbated, and these pressures are
already very substantial. In the United States, it is the recent massive investment
in housing that has been unwelcome from an external adjustment perspective.
Housing is the ultimate non-tradable, non-fungible and long-lived good. The

150

BIS 77th Annual Report

implication is that, to achieve the internal reallocation of capital and labour
required in the countries concerned, the price signal provided by exchange
rate movements might need to be significantly greater than otherwise.
Turning to financial sector developments, it would clearly be undesirable,
even were it possible, to roll back the changes that have occurred over the
last few decades in the advanced industrial countries. Nevertheless, more
scepticism might be expressed about some of the purported benefits of having
new players, new instruments and new business models, in particular the
“originate and distribute” approach which has become so widespread. These
developments have clear benefits, but they may also have side effects, with
associated costs. In emerging market economies, the essential point is that
liberalisation needs to be preceded by structural changes that will allow
financial systems to remain resilient in the face of both domestic and external
shocks. While much progress has been made, much more is still needed.
Finally, it is worth noting that domestic policymakers have always faced
the challenge of responding to external shocks but, in our globalised and
market-driven world, these have become ever more significant. Moreover, for
the same reasons, the actions of domestic policymakers increasingly have
external effects on others. These interactions apply in good times, but perhaps
become more important in bad ones, when the efforts of many national
authorities need to be harnessed to manage international problems at the least
cost. While international cooperation has improved in some areas, the political
and institutional structure has not kept up with these changing global realities.
There is still far too strong a tendency for national authorities to go it alone,
and for international dialogue to go no further than that. This is yet another
global imbalance that urgently needs to be dealt with.

BIS 77th Annual Report

Organisation, governance and activities

This chapter provides an overview of the internal organisation and governance
of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). It also reviews the activities of
the Bank, and of the international groups it hosts, over the past financial year.
These activities focus on promoting cooperation among central banks and
other financial authorities, and on providing financial services to central bank
customers.

Organisation and governance of the Bank

The Bank, its management and shareholders
The BIS is an international organisation that fosters international monetary and
financial cooperation and serves as a bank for central banks. Its head office is
in Basel, Switzerland, and it has two representative offices, one in the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China and one
in Mexico City. The Bank currently employs 562 staff from 49 countries.
The BIS fulfils its mandate by acting as:
• a forum to promote discussion and facilitate decision-making among
central banks and to support dialogue with other authorities with
responsibility for promoting financial stability;
• a centre for research on policy issues confronting central banks and
financial sector supervisory authorities;
• a prime counterparty for central banks in their financial transactions; and
• an agent or trustee in connection with international financial operations.
The Bank also hosts the secretariats of a number of committees and
organisations that seek to promote financial stability:
• The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the Committee on the
Global Financial System, the Committee on Payment and Settlement
Systems and the Markets Committee were established by the Governors
of the G10 central banks at various times over the past 40 years. They
enjoy a significant degree of autonomy in setting their agendas and
structuring their activities.
• The Financial Stability Forum, the International Association of Insurance
Supervisors and the International Association of Deposit Insurers are
independent organisations whose secretariats are also hosted by the BIS
but do not directly report to the BIS or its member central banks.
• The Irving Fisher Committee on Central Bank Statistics is governed by the
international central banking community and operates under the auspices
of the BIS.
Details of the role and recent activities of these committees and
organisations are provided below.

BIS 77th Annual Report

155

The Bank has three main departments: the Monetary and Economic
Department, the Banking Department and the General Secretariat. These are
supplemented by: the Legal Service; the Compliance and Operational Risk,
Internal Audit and Risk Control units; and the Financial Stability Institute,
which fosters the dissemination of standards and best practices to financial
system supervisors worldwide.
Three main bodies govern and manage the Bank:
• The General Meeting of member central banks. Fifty-five central banks or
monetary authorities currently have rights of voting and representation at
General Meetings. The Annual General Meeting is held within four months
of the end of the Bank’s financial year, 31 March. In 2006, 100 central
banks took part, including 77 at Governor level. Delegates from 20
international institutions also attended.
• The Board of Directors, currently comprising 19 members. Its main tasks
include determining the strategic and policy direction of the Bank and
supervising the Bank’s Management. The Board is assisted by the Audit
Committee and the Consultative Committee, composed of selected
Directors.
• The Executive Committee, chaired by the General Manager and
comprising the Deputy General Manager, the Heads of Department and
other officers of similar rank appointed by the Board. The Executive
Committee advises the General Manager on all important matters affecting
the Bank as a whole.
Member central banks, Directors and senior officials, and recent changes
in the composition of the Board and Management are listed at the end of this
chapter.

Governance of the Bank
Board enlargement
With a view to further strengthening central bank cooperation, and in line with
the Bank’s more global role, the Board of Directors decided on 26 June 2006 to
elect, in accordance with Article 27(3) of the Bank’s Statutes, three additional
central bank Governors as members of the Board of Directors. Guillermo Ortiz,
Governor of the Bank of Mexico, Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the
European Central Bank, and Zhou Xiaochuan, Governor of the People’s Bank
of China, were duly elected with effect from 1 July 2006. Their terms of office
are for three years and may be renewed.
Following the increase in the number of BIS shareholders in recent years,
these elections bring the global diversity of BIS membership to Board level.

Promotion of international financial and monetary cooperation:
direct contributions of the BIS

Regular consultations on monetary and financial matters
Every two months, the Governors and other senior officials of the BIS member
central banks convene for a series of meetings to discuss current economic
and financial developments and the outlook for the world economy and
financial markets. They also exchange views and experiences on issues of
special and topical interest to central banks. These bimonthly meetings,
normally held in Basel, are one of the most important ways in which the Bank
promotes cooperation within the central banking community. The November
2006 BIS bimonthly meetings took place in Sydney and were hosted by the
Reserve Bank of Australia.
This series of meetings organised every two months comprises, in
particular, the Global Economy Meeting and the All Governors’ Meeting.
The Global Economy Meeting brings to the discussion table more than
30 Governors of key industrial and emerging market economies. This group
monitors economic and financial developments and assesses the risks and
opportunities in the world economy and financial markets. In May 2006, the
Board of Governors adopted a new format for the Global Economy Meeting,
which was implemented in September 2006. A major change was to increase
the number of attendees by generally inviting the Governors of a wider number
of small to medium-sized economies, while at the same time introducing a
more appropriate regional representation.
The All Governors’ Meeting, in which all shareholding member central
bank Governors participate, discusses selected topics that are of general
interest to all BIS member central banks. In 2006/07, the topics discussed
were:
• measuring inflation, as a key element in the conduct of monetary policy;
• developments in the area of large-value payment and settlement
systems;
• trends in financial integration in emerging market economies and the
associated policy challenges;
• statistical challenges for central bank policymaking and the role and
activities of the Irving Fisher Committee; and
• risk management organisation and implementation in the governance
of large private sector financial institutions.
Other regular meetings that take place during these bimonthly
gatherings are the meetings of Governors of the G10 countries and those of
Governors of major emerging market economies, which explore themes that
are of special relevance to the respective groups of economies. Governors
who are members of the Central Bank Governance Group also meet on a
regular basis.
Because not all central banks are directly involved in the work of the
Basel-based committees and other organisations hosted by the Bank, special
meetings for Governors take place as needed to brief them on the activities of

158

BIS 77th Annual Report

these specialised groupings or to explore topics of direct importance. In
2006/07, selected groups of Governors discussed:
• the relationship between the central bank and the government;
• the challenges for central banks posed by current global economic and
financial developments, especially in their effects on smaller industrial
and emerging market economies; and
• the implications of the rise of emerging market economies for the
international monetary system.
In analysing issues related to financial stability, Governors attach
importance to dialogue with heads of supervisory agencies, other financial
authorities and senior executives from the private financial sector. The Bank
regularly organises informal discussions among public and private sector
representatives that focus on their shared interests in promoting and
maintaining a sound and well functioning international financial system. In
addition, the Bank organises various other meetings, on a regular or an ad hoc
basis, for senior central bank officials. In a number of these meetings, other
financial authorities, the private financial sector and the academic community
are invited to contribute to the dialogue.
Other meetings organised for senior central bankers on a less frequent
basis include:
• the meetings of the working parties on domestic monetary policy, held in
Basel but also hosted on a regional basis by a number of central banks
in Asia, central and eastern Europe, and Latin America; and
• the meeting of Deputy Governors of emerging market economies, for
which this year’s theme was the changing nature of the transmission
mechanism for monetary policy in emerging market economies.

Representative Offices
The Representative Office for Asia and the Pacific (Asian Office) and that for
the Americas (Americas Office) aim to strengthen relations between the BIS
and central banks and financial supervisory authorities in the respective
regions, and to promote cooperation within each region. The Offices organise
meetings, foster the exchange of information and data, and contribute to the
Bank’s financial and economic research. The Offices also help to deliver BIS
banking services through regular visits to reserve managers in central banks
and meetings at both technical and managerial levels.

Asia-Pacific
During the past year, the Asian Office worked to strengthen its relationship
with BIS shareholders in the region. To this end, both the dealing room and,
especially, the research team took on additional staff.
The Asian Office organised or supported meetings on monetary policy,
financial market development and financial stability. A highlight was a highlevel meeting on central bank monitoring of financial markets, held jointly
with the People’s Bank of China in Hong Kong SAR in November 2006. Other
meetings were held in conjunction with the EMEAP working groups on banking

BIS 77th Annual Report

159

supervision and financial markets, as well as with the Hong Kong Institute for
Monetary Research.

Banking activity and the Asian Bond Funds
The Asian Office’s dealing room made progress towards providing the full
range of BIS banking services to regional customers. It further developed its
foreign exchange activity and expanded investments in the region through
both placements with existing counterparties and new outlets.
As fund manager of the first Asian Bond Fund (ABF1) initiative of the
Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP), the BIS
continues to invest a portfolio of US dollar-denominated sovereign and quasisovereign issues of eight EMEAP economies.
As fund administrator, the BIS helped to widen the offering of bond
funds to the public under EMEAP’s second Asian Bond Fund (ABF2) initiative.
Eleven central banks have provided seed money from their international
reserves to purchase funds that invest in sovereign and quasi-sovereign
domestic currency denominated bonds in eight EMEAP economies. The
launching of public bond funds in Indonesia, Korea and the Philippines, in
addition to the four individual market funds launched last year, helped to bring
the overall size of the ABF2 to $3.1 billion at end-March 2007. Approximately
$800 million of private investment now complements the investment by
central banks, which has grown from $2 billion to $2.3 billion. The Pan Asia
Bond Index Fund returned about 17% in its first 21 months of operation, to
March 2007.

Asian Consultative Council and the BIS Special Governors’ Meeting in Asia
The Asian Consultative Council (ACC) comprises the Governors of the BIS
member central banks in the Asia-Pacific region. It provides a vehicle for
communication between these central banks and the BIS Board and
Management on matters of interest and concern to the Asian central banking
community. The BIS Asian Office provides the secretariat services for the ACC.
Two meetings of the ACC gave Asian shareholding central banks the
opportunity to guide the BIS Board and Management in their efforts to
strengthen the Bank’s relationship with them. These efforts include the
widening of banking services, enhancement of the work of the Financial
Stability Institute, and a three-year Asian research programme directed at
improving monetary policy and operations, developing money and capital
markets, and promoting financial stability and prudential policy. At both
meetings, ACC members discussed individual research topics, clarifying the
policy concerns underlying their suggestions. At the February meeting in
Hong Kong SAR, the ACC had the opportunity to respond to some research
initiatives that had been completed, in particular work on the household
finance sector in Asia. In addition, the chair of the Task Force on Regional
Cooperation among Central Banks reported on its work, which had been
commissioned at the ACC retreat the previous year.
Each year, the BIS hosts a Special Governors’ Meeting in Asia. This
informal meeting of central bank governors provides an opportunity for

160

BIS 77th Annual Report

Governors to review the global economic and financial situation, with specific
emphasis on developments in Asia and the Pacific. Following the February
ACC meeting, Asia-Pacific Governors and several other Governors met for the
ninth Special Governors’ Meeting. They discussed the appropriate policy
response to strong capital flows from outside the region, the economic outlook,
and how central banks should monitor financial markets.

Asian research programme
The three-year Asian research programme began in September 2006. Regional
central bankers and bank supervisors have organised themselves into
two research networks, one that studies monetary policy and exchange rates,
and the other analysing financial markets and institutions. The networks share
information on policy issues, identify collaborative projects and organise
workshops. Five economists have been hired on contracts of up to three
years. In addition, the programme has hosted, and continues to seek,
researchers from regional central banks, as well as from regional universities
and policy institutes.

The Americas
During its fourth year of operation, the Americas Office focused its activity on
strengthening its contacts with central banks in the region and cooperating
more closely with regional supervisory authorities. Unlike the Asian Office, the
Americas Office has no trading room, but it nonetheless actively supports BIS
banking activities in the region. One highlight in this regard was a high-level
seminar on reserve management, held in Santiago in May 2006.
Research efforts mainly concerned the development of fixed income
markets in countries of the region and economic modelling (so-called dynamic
stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models).
The Office also organised or supported a series of high-level meetings
in Mexico and elsewhere, sometimes jointly with regional central banks and
other institutions. Highlights included a meeting for regional central banks on
transmission mechanisms for monetary policy, held in Colombia in March 2007;
a meeting of the Working Party on Monetary Policy in Latin America,
held in Peru in October 2006; and two sessions at the 11th Annual Meeting
of the Latin America and Caribbean Economic Association in Mexico in
November 2006, one on “Using DSGE models for policy analysis” and another
on “The development of domestic bond markets and financial stability
implications”. Also noteworthy were the numerous regional seminars organised
mainly by the FSI.

Financial Stability Institute
The Financial Stability Institute (FSI) assists financial sector supervisory
authorities worldwide in strengthening oversight of their financial systems,
thereby fostering financial stability globally. The FSI follows a two-pronged
approach designed to disseminate standards and sound practices primarily to
the banking and insurance supervision sectors.

BIS 77th Annual Report

161

Meetings, seminars and conferences
The first prong of the FSI approach is a long-standing series of high-level
meetings, seminars and conferences both in Basel and in various regions of
the world. In 2006, the FSI organised a total of 52 events on a broad range
of financial sector topics. More than 1,600 representatives of central banks
and banking and insurance supervisory agencies participated. Of particular
note were the high-level regional meetings held for Deputy Governors and
heads of supervisory authorities in Asia, Latin America and the Middle East.
These meetings focused principally on Basel II implementation.

FSI Connect
The second prong of the FSI approach is FSI Connect, an online information
and learning resource tool for financial sector supervisors and central bankers.
FSI Connect currently includes more than 120 tutorials covering a wide range
of topics for users at all levels of experience and expertise. The FSI continues
to add new topics. In addition, 40 tutorials related to capital and Basel II have
been made available in French and Spanish. More than 125 central banks and
supervisory authorities subscribe to FSI Connect, representing more than
8,000 users. It is available to subscribers 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

Other major initiatives
In 2006, the FSI updated its 2004 survey on the plans of individual countries to
implement Basel II. The new survey confirmed that more than 90 countries
plan to do so, with most of them starting with the less advanced approaches.
Compared with the 2004 survey, some countries anticipate slight delays in
their Basel II implementation timetable. These delays appear to reflect a more
realistic assessment of what is needed to achieve implementation, especially
with regard to the more sophisticated approaches.

Promotion of financial stability through the permanent committees
hosted by the BIS

Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, chaired by Nout Wellink,
President of the Netherlands Bank, provides a forum for dialogue and
information exchange among supervisors. It promotes improvements in bank
risk management practices and the framework for banking supervision, and
mechanisms for effective implementation by many countries of the principles
developed by the Committee.

Reorganisation of the Committee’s group structure
In October 2006 the Committee adopted a new, streamlined structure for its
working groups. While maintaining a strong focus on capital adequacy issues,
this restructuring emphasises a forward-looking strategy that has four
interrelated and mutually reinforcing elements:

162

BIS 77th Annual Report

•
•

to maintain a strong capital foundation for banks;
to reinforce this foundation by promoting other infrastructure needed for
sound supervision;
• to develop policy responses that are proportionate and flexible; and
• to deepen and expand outreach to non-Committee supervisors, as well as
to other financial sectors and to the industry.
In support of this strategy, the Committee has reorganised its work around
four core groups. These are:
• the Accord Implementation Group, established to share information and
promote consistency in Basel II implementation;
• the Accounting Task Force, which works to ensure that international
accounting and auditing standards and practices promote sound risk
management at financial institutions, support market discipline through
transparency, and reinforce the safety and soundness of the banking
system;
• the International Liaison Group, which provides a forum for deepening the
Committee’s engagement with supervisors around the world on a broad
range of issues; and
• the Policy Development Group, which identifies and reviews emerging
supervisory issues and proposes and develops policies to promote a
sound banking system and high supervisory standards.

Implementation of the revised capital framework (“Basel II”)
Consistent cross-border implementation of Basel II remains an important focus
for the Basel Committee. Supporting this objective, and to assist banks and
supervisors as they prepare to implement Basel II, the Committee has released
a series of papers to provide further clarity and guidance on a variety of
Basel II implementation issues. These include papers related to home-host
information sharing for effective Basel II implementation, the “use test” for
the internal ratings-based approach, the observed range of practice in key
elements of the advanced measurement approaches (AMA) for operational
risk, and home-host supervisory cooperation and allocation mechanisms in the
context of AMA.
In 2007, the Committee is paying particular attention to Pillar 2
(Supervisory Review Process) of the Basel II framework, reflecting the increasing
international attention by both supervisors and the industry. A specific
example is the Accord Implementation Group’s use of case studies, allowing
supervisors and bankers to deal with practical implementation issues.

Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision
At the International Conference of Banking Supervisors (ICBS) held in Mérida,
Mexico in October 2006, senior bank supervisors and central bankers
from over 120 countries endorsed a significantly enhanced version of the
Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision and the Core Principles
Methodology. The 25 Core Principles are globally agreed minimum standards
for banking regulation and supervision, while the Core Principles Methodology
provides guidance on how to interpret and assess the principles.

BIS 77th Annual Report

163

The Basel Committee decided to update the Core Principles, first
promulgated in 1997, in the light of the many innovations and developments
in banking, financial instruments and the markets within which banks operate,
and the methods and approaches used by supervisors. In addition, experience
gained through country assessments had made it clear that key elements of
the existing Principles should be clarified and strengthened.
The revised Core Principles pay significantly more attention to sound risk
management and corporate governance practices. The criteria for dealing with
the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing, as well as fraud
prevention, have also been strengthened. In addition, cross-border and crosssectoral trends and developments are reflected more comprehensively, as is
the need for closer cooperation and information exchange between supervisors
from different sectors and jurisdictions. The importance of the independence,
accountability and transparency of bank supervisory authorities has been
further emphasised.

Accounting, auditing and compliance
In June 2006, the Basel Committee finalised its supervisory guidance on the
use of the fair value option for financial instruments by banks and will continue
to monitor its implementation. Over the past year, the Committee has taken an
active role in the work to develop international accounting and auditing
standards and has responded to several formal requests for comment from the
International Accounting Standards Board and other international accounting
and auditing standard setters. As the use of fair value estimates in financial
statements has increased, the Committee has been keen to ensure that these
estimates are reliable, relevant and auditable. In addition to its work on
accounting standards related to financial instruments, the Committee is also
focusing on issues related to the development of a common conceptual
framework and the review of key audit issues from a banking supervision
perspective.

Outreach
In recent years the Basel Committee has been working to further enhance its
dialogue with supervisors around the world. At the October 2006 ICBS,
participants reiterated the importance of continued improvements in banks’
governance and risk management, and confirmed their determination to
improve supervisory cooperation and information sharing. They also focused
on issues arising from the growing presence of international banks in domestic
markets.
The International Liaison Group (ILG) provides a platform for non-member
countries to contribute to new Basel Committee initiatives early in the process
and to develop proposals that are of particular interest to ILG members.
The Committee will continue to explore ways to expand its dialogue with
non-member countries and to support the current level of involvement
through the work of the ILG, meetings with regional groups of banking
supervisors and the biennial ICBS, as well as other formal and informal
mechanisms.

BIS 77th Annual Report

Committee on the Global Financial System
The Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS), chaired by Donald L
Kohn, Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System, monitors financial market developments and analyses their
implications for financial stability. The Committee, whose members are the
G10 central banks and the Central Bank of Luxembourg, regularly invites
representatives from the central banks or monetary authorities of Australia,
Brazil, China, Hong Kong SAR, India, Korea, Mexico, Singapore and Spain to
join its discussions.
Important topics of discussion during the past year included:
• the possible impact of a sudden repricing of risk and of the transmission
of shocks to the real economy in increasingly integrated capital markets;
• the capacity of the global financial system to disperse risks across a wider
investor base in the light of innovations in structured credit products;
• the risks that could arise from carry trades, in which investors borrow in
low-yielding currencies and invest in high-yielding ones; and
• the impact of changes in financial market volatility on global financial
stability.
As part of its efforts to gain a deeper understanding of structural
developments in financial markets, the CGFS established two working groups.
One focused on the determinants of institutional investors’ asset allocation
decisions and their potential implications for the financial system, given the
increasingly important role they play in channelling household savings and
pension assets into financial markets.
The second working group examined the impact on domestic financial
intermediation of a switch in emerging market economies from foreign
currency to local currency debt, and the challenges that remain in developing
more liquid local bond markets.
In addition, the Committee organised several special meetings:
• a workshop on structural changes in credit markets to update market
information gathered through past CGFS initiatives and to discuss ongoing
trends in credit markets;
• a workshop on balance sheet effects and emerging market bond spreads,
to analyse the factors influencing sovereign spreads;
• a workshop on the use of the BIS international financial statistics in
research on global financial stability; and
• regional meetings on housing finance at the Central Bank of Malaysia
and the National Bank of Denmark, following the publication of a CGFS
working group report on Housing finance in the global financial system.

Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems
The Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS), chaired by
Timothy F Geithner, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York, contributes to strengthening financial market
infrastructure by promoting sound and efficient payment and settlement

BIS 77th Annual Report

165

systems. It cooperates with other international institutions and groupings,
and involves a wide group of central banks in its work.
In 2006, the Committee carried out a new survey of how banks and other
selected institutions manage the risks they may incur when settling foreign
exchange transactions. The results will help the Committee to assess
the extent to which foreign exchange settlement risk remains a threat to the
financial system and whether there is a need for further action on the part of
individual banks, the industry and central banks. The Committee expects to
publish its findings in late 2007.
In January 2007, the CPSS and the World Bank issued a joint report on
General principles for international remittance services. Based on an analysis
of the payment system aspects of remittances, the report sets out five general
principles designed to assist countries that want to improve the market for
remittance services. These principles relate to: transparency and consumer
protection, payment system infrastructure, the legal and regulatory framework,
market structure and competition, and governance and risk management.
In March 2007, the Committee issued a report on New developments in
clearing and settlement arrangements for OTC derivatives. It analyses existing
arrangements and risk management practices in the broader OTC derivatives
market and evaluates the potential for risks to be mitigated by greater use of,
and enhancements to, market infrastructure. The report focuses on:
• the risks created by delays in documenting and confirming transactions;
• the implications of the rapidly expanding use of collateral to mitigate
counterparty credit risks;
• the potential for expanding the use of central counterparty clearing to
reduce counterparty risks;
• the implications of OTC derivatives prime brokerage;
• the risks associated with unauthorised novations of contracts; and
• the potential for significant market disruptions from the closeout of OTC
derivatives transactions following the default of a large market participant.
The Committee continued to enhance cooperation among central banks,
including those of emerging market economies. It also provided support and
expertise to workshops and seminars on payment system issues organised by
the BIS in cooperation with regional central banking organisations.

Markets Committee
The Markets Committee, chaired by Hiroshi Nakaso, Director General of the
Bank of Japan, brings together senior officials responsible for market
operations at G10 central banks. At its bimonthly meetings, participants
exchange views on recent developments in foreign exchange and related
financial markets. In particular, the Committee focuses on the short-run
implications of specific events, and also the implications of structural changes,
for the functioning of these markets. The Committee regularly invites
representatives from the central banks or monetary authorities of Australia,
Brazil, China, Hong Kong SAR, India, Korea, Mexico, Singapore and Spain to
join its discussions.

166

BIS 77th Annual Report

Issues covered in this year’s meetings included:
• the impact of monetary policy decisions on markets;
• movements in exchange rates, including the analysis of carry trade
strategies;
• financial market developments related to commodities;
• the impact across different asset classes of sudden shifts in risk appetite;
and
• capital inflows into emerging markets, in particular emerging equity
markets.
Members also discussed a number of specific topics, including
preparations for the 2007 Triennial Central Bank Survey of Foreign Exchange
and Derivatives Market Activity, the growing role of institutional investors in
financial markets, recent developments in commodity markets, and regional
investment in emerging markets. Some of these topics were discussed with
private sector representatives at special meetings.

Central Bank Counterfeit Deterrence Group
The Central Bank Counterfeit Deterrence Group (CBCDG), chaired by Bonnie
Schwab, Adviser, Currency, at the Bank of Canada, is mandated by the
Governors of the G10 central banks to investigate emerging threats to
the security of banknotes and to propose solutions for implementation by the
issuing authorities. The CBCDG has developed anti-counterfeiting features to
prevent banknote images from being replicated by colour copiers and digital
technology (personal computers, printers and scanners). The BIS continued to
support the work of the CBCDG by hosting its Secretariat and by acting as its
agent in contractual arrangements.

Other areas of central bank cooperation promoted by the BIS

Research activities
In addition to providing background material for meetings of senior central
bankers, and secretariat and analytical services to committees, the BIS
contributes to international monetary and financial cooperation by carrying out
its own research and analysis on issues of interest to central banks and,
increasingly, financial supervisory authorities. This work finds its way into the
Bank’s publications, such as the Annual Report, the Quarterly Review and the
BIS Papers and Working Papers series, as well as external professional
publications. Most of the Bank’s research is published on its website
(www.bis.org).
In line with the Bank’s mission, the long-term focus of the research is on
monetary and financial stability issues. Themes receiving special attention
recently included:
• changes in the inflation process, in particular the linkages between
inflation and globalisation, as well as the role of exchange rates;
• the role of monetary and credit aggregates in monetary policy frameworks;

BIS 77th Annual Report

167

•
•

the measurement and pricing of credit risk;
the measurement of risk appetite and its impact on the pricing of financial
assets;
• trends in international banking;
• coordination between monetary and prudential policies;
• foreign exchange reserve management practices; and
• monetary and financial stability issues in Asia-Pacific under the three-year
Asian research programme (see above).
As part of its research activities the BIS also organises conferences
and workshops, typically bringing together senior policymakers, academics
and market participants. In the past year, meetings of this sort included:
• the Fifth BIS Annual Conference, held in Brunnen, Switzerland in June
2006, which focused on financial globalisation;
• central bank economists’ meetings, held twice a year, which in October
2006 examined the determinants and policy implications of changing asset
prices; and
• a meeting of central bank legal experts, which focused on legal aspects of
immunities applicable to central banks’ assets.

Central bank governance
Central banks’ growing interest in organisational, governance and strategic
management issues led the BIS, at the end of 2006, to reorganise and increase
its secretariat support for the Central Bank Governance Forum. This builds on
the adoption in 2005 of a charter for the Forum. The Governance Forum fosters
the good governance of central banks as public policy institutions. It consists
of the Central Bank Governance Group, the Central Bank Governance Network
and the Secretariat provided by the BIS.
The Governance Group, comprising Governors from a broadly based and
representative group of central banks, met several times during the year.
Topics of discussion included the management of conflicts of interest and
public perceptions of central banks. The Group also initiated major studies of
the organisation of risk management within central banks and key issues in
the design of a modern central bank.
The Governance Network – now spanning almost 50 central banks and
monetary authorities – again actively provided information and expertise on
organisational, governance and strategic management issues.
Several special-focus surveys were conducted in support of the
Governance Group’s deliberations and for the benefit of Governance Network
central banks that are reviewing their own practices.

Cooperation in the statistical area
The BIS contributes to, and closely monitors, ongoing efforts to improve
economic, monetary and financial statistics at the international, regional and
national level. BIS statistical experts are also invited to participate in expert
meetings of the IMF, OECD and ECB.

168

BIS 77th Annual Report

Irving Fisher Committee on Central Bank Statistics
During 2006, the Irving Fisher Committee on Central Bank Statistics (IFC), a
forum of central bank users and compilers of statistics, established itself at the
BIS, with most of the BIS’s shareholding central banks formally becoming full
institutional members. The Committee’s first meeting at the BIS, at which
53 members were represented, was held on 29 August 2006. At this meeting the
Committee’s functions and future activities were defined and a new Executive
was constituted. The Committee is chaired by Jan Smets, Director at the
National Bank of Belgium. Membership is open to all interested central banks.
The IFC also welcomes individual and institutional members from inside and
outside the central banking community as associates.
Highlights of the year included:
• the Third IFC Conference (August 2006), the theme of which was
“Measuring the financial position of the household sector”. More than
130 experts from 68 central banks participated; and
• a contribution to the International Association of Official Statistics “People
on the move” conference (September 2006). The topic of the plenary
session organised by the IFC was “Financial aspects of migration: the
measurement of remittances”.
The proceedings of these meetings are published in the IFC Bulletin,
which is now part of the BIS publications series.

BIS Data Bank
Through the Data Bank, participating central banks regularly report national data
to the BIS, which makes these data available to the other participants. Users
access the Data Bank through a newly redesigned web-based application,
rolled out in the past year. At the same time, the Data Bank’s content has been
expanded to include data on payment and settlement systems, in particular
those collected regularly by the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems.
Korea’s central bank and Singapore’s monetary authority officially became
participants in the past year, bringing the total to 41 BIS shareholding central
banks. Those member central banks that do not participate in the Data Bank
have started to report a limited number of key economic indicators; these are
included in the background statistical document prepared for each BIS
bimonthly meeting.
The Data Bank’s technical platform electronically receives and/or
disseminates the BIS international financial statistics on international banking,
securities, foreign exchange and derivatives markets.

International financial statistics
Last year the guidelines to the BIS international banking statistics, which are
an important methodological source for users of these data, were updated. The
BIS and reporting central banks also carried out analytical work on the
relationship between the locational and consolidated banking datasets and on
estimates for the currency breakdown of the consolidated statistics.
BIS statisticians supported the collection of data on securities markets by
the CGFS’s working group on local currency bond markets (see above). The

BIS 77th Annual Report

169

exercise identified which data are currently available on securities issuance
and holdings from various national and international sources, permitting
improvements in the BIS securities statistics.
The BIS banking and securities statistics are an important data source for
the Joint External Debt Hub, established in cooperation with the IMF, OECD
and World Bank. Last year the BIS began to cooperate actively with the
International Union of Credit and Investment Insurers (the Berne Union) in
order to obtain data on international trade credit for inclusion in the Hub.
Preparations for the next Triennial Central Bank Survey of Foreign
Exchange and Derivatives Market Activity, to be carried out between April and
June 2007, got well under way during the year. It is expected that 54 central
banks from around the world will participate. The findings will be published in
the second half of 2007.

Statistical information technology applications upgrade
The BIS is undertaking a multi-year upgrade of its relevant information
technology (IT) applications to improve its capability to support central bank
cooperation in the statistical area. In the course of this project, the BIS has
collected information from central banks pertaining to the use of graphical tools
as well as time series in the context of relational databases. This information is
typically shared with the central banks submitting such information to the BIS.

Statistical Data and Metadata Exchange
As in 2006, in 2007 the BIS is chairing the Statistical Data and Metadata
Exchange (SDMX) initiative, which fosters standards for the exchange of
statistical information. It is sponsored by the BIS, along with the ECB, Eurostat,
IMF, OECD, United Nations and World Bank. SDMX products include:
• technical standards, approved by the International Organization for
Standardization;
• content-oriented guidelines for exchange of data and metadata; and
• implementation tools that are made available by sponsoring organisations
or private sector vendors.
More than 200 experts attended a conference hosted by the World Bank,
“Towards implementation of SDMX”, in January 2007. It gave an overview of
SDMX developments, demonstrated practical implementations and provided
introductory capacity-building. At the conference, a joint project was announced
by SDMX and XBRL International (eXtensible Business Reporting Language,
used for electronic exchange of accounting information). This will explore
opportunities for interoperability between their respective data exchange formats.
Draft standards and guidelines are available for public comment on the
SDMX website (www.sdmx.org).

Group of Computer Experts of the G10 central banks
The major goal of the Group of Computer Experts is to share technical and
organisational experiences in the IT area among a number of key central banks.
The Group, supported by working groups and task forces, meets twice a year.

170

BIS 77th Annual Report

The Group’s November 2006 meeting assessed central banks’
experiences under the topic of “Applications”, with a special review of rapid
application development (RAD). IT governance, business continuity and IT
security were dominant themes. A number of cooperative developments among
central banks, particularly related to the implementation of the European
payment system TARGET2 in 2007, were also discussed.
The Group’s Working Party on Security Issues (WPSI) held two meetings
in the last year to discuss:
• organisational structures and the trend towards merging IT and physical
security;
• risks from malicious mobile code;
• solutions for remote access;
• network segregation; and
• the costs of security solutions.
On the subject of business continuity, emphasis has been placed on risk
management, particularly as related to preparations for possible pandemics.
There has also been an increased focus on resilience in staff resources, as
opposed to a past emphasis on physical and IT resources.
In June 2007, the Group held its triennial workshop, now called the
Central Bank Information Technology Exchange (CBITX). The four scheduled
sessions covered “Meeting the needs of knowledge workers”, “Portfolio
management and cost accounting”, “IT risk management” and “IT services
provision”, and offered opportunities for participants to share their experiences,
concerns and lessons learned in these areas.
A decision was taken this year to hold a joint meeting of the G10 heads
of IT security and the WPSI. The first meeting, Workshop 2008, to be held in
March 2008 at the BIS, will enable the sharing of experiences and information
relating to operational risks to central banks.

Cooperation with regional central bank groupings
Although the BIS does not provide bilateral technical assistance, it occasionally
supports regional training initiatives for central banks. During the past year this
included:
• a workshop on “Financial stability: role of central banks”, organised by the
Bank of Algeria for central bankers from the French-speaking countries of
North and West Africa;
• a seminar on “Non-bank financial intermediation: challenges for central
banks”, organised by the South East Asian Central Banks (SEACEN) and
hosted by the State Bank of Vietnam;
• the organisation of two modules, one on banking and finance and the
other on monetary policy, as part of the Masters in Banking and Finance
programme of the Centre Africain d’Études Supérieures en Gestion
(CESAG), located in Dakar;
• a meeting hosted by the Reserve Bank of South Africa for the central
banks of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) on the
topic of regional monetary and financial integration; and

BIS 77th Annual Report

171

•

a seminar on bank and market-based financial intermediation for central
banks from central and eastern Europe, and the Commonwealth of
Independent States at the Joint Vienna Institute.
In summer 2006, 40 central banks from industrial countries, central and
eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States met in Basel for
the annual meeting of the Group of Coordinators of Technical Cooperation and
Training. One of the topics discussed was the shift in demand for technical
cooperation towards new regions, notably the Middle East, Asia and Africa
(including the Maghreb).

Internal Audit
G10 central bank auditors meet regularly to share experience and knowledge
in their area of expertise, and to address new issues and challenges. The main
topics for discussion usually derive from international auditing standards and
the continuous need to improve control over the risks faced by central banks.
Twice a year, the BIS’s Internal Audit unit organises and hosts the meetings of
the G10 Working Party on IT Audit Methodologies.
In June 2006, the BIS participated in the 20th Annual Plenary Conference
of G10 Heads of Internal Audit, hosted by the Netherlands Bank and covering:
ethics, ethical awareness and auditing; the use of risk models; and auditing
business continuity management (for which the BIS coordinated the work of a
G10 task force).
BIS Internal Audit has established an information sharing network
for internal audit heads from Asia-Pacific central banks and monetary
authorities. In October, the BIS Representative Office for the Americas,
in cooperation with Internal Audit, organised in Mexico City the first BIS
meeting of heads of internal audit from Latin American and Caribbean
central banks.

BIS contributions to broader international financial cooperation

Group of Ten
In contributing to the work of the G10 Finance Ministers and central bank
Governors, the BIS participates as an observer institution and provides
secretariat support together with the IMF and OECD. At their September 2006
meeting in Singapore, the G10 Ministers and Governors considered a report
on the prospects for the G10 and concluded that the global economy’s
changing landscape underscored the need to give greater focus to
international economic cooperation. They agreed that future annual meetings
of G10 Ministers and Governors would be most useful if they included
informal and frank discussions of significant international economic and
financial issues. To facilitate such discussions, the Chairman of the G10 could
invite the FSF Chair, the chairs of the various G10 committees or other
participants in the meeting to introduce issues for discussion pertaining to
financial markets and systems.

172

BIS 77th Annual Report

Financial Stability Forum
The Financial Stability Forum (FSF), chaired by Mario Draghi, Governor of the
Bank of Italy, was established at the BIS in 1999 by G7 Finance Ministers and
central bank Governors to promote international financial stability through
enhanced information exchange and cooperation in financial supervision and
surveillance. Its remit is to assess risks and vulnerabilities affecting the
international financial system and to encourage and coordinate action to
address them. The FSF comprises senior officials from finance ministries,
central banks and financial regulators in key financial centres, as well as
representatives of international financial institutions (the BIS, IMF, OECD and
World Bank), international supervisory and regulatory standard-setting bodies
(the Basel Committee, the IAIS, the International Accounting Standards Board
(IASB) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO))
and central bank expert groupings (CGFS and CPSS). Switzerland joined the
FSF in January 2007.
The FSF meets twice yearly in plenary form, most recently in September
2006 in Paris and March 2007 in Frankfurt. The Forum also holds regional
meetings to foster wider exchanges of views on financial vulnerabilities and the
work under way nationally and internationally to address them. The most
recent regional meeting was held in Stockholm in January 2007, focusing on
rapid credit growth, foreign currency borrowing and supervisory challenges
associated with cross-border banking in emerging European economies.
At its March 2007 meeting, the FSF reviewed the drivers and implications
of the turbulence in financial markets in late February and early March 2007.
It also discussed developments in credit risk transfer markets and the impact
of increased private equity and leveraged buyout transactions on overall
corporate leverage and credit exposures of intermediaries. The FSF also
assessed the systemic risks posed by the growth of the hedge fund sector and
the supervisory, regulatory and private sector actions taken in recent years
to strengthen market discipline, risk management practices and market
infrastructure. In the light of the increasing involvement of hedge funds in
credit markets with complex products, the FSF discussed how financial
institutions are responding to associated risks, including developments in
collateral, margining and stress testing practices. Following a request from G7
Finance Ministers and central bank Governors, the FSF has prepared an
update of its 2000 report on highly leveraged institutions.
The FSF has also worked to promote the preparedness of financial
authorities and the wider financial sector for dealing with possible
financial crises and business continuity incidents, including an avian flu
pandemic. In November last year, the FSF and the UK authorities organised a
workshop on planning and communication for financial crises and business
continuity incidents. As a follow-up, the FSF members are sharing information
and experiences in this area, including lessons learned from crisis exercises
and business continuity incidents.
The FSF is also promoting work on how regulation could be made more
effective and efficient, including by facilitating dialogue between regulators and

BIS 77th Annual Report

173

the financial industry. As part of this work, the FSF’s regulatory members are
undertaking a stocktaking exercise on the principles and procedures they
follow in the development and interpretation of new regulations and other
policy initiatives.
The FSF has supported efforts to strengthen international auditing and
accounting standards and practices. In the light of the need to strengthen
audit quality and improve the global consistency of audit regulation, the
FSF welcomed the first meeting of the International Forum of Independent
Audit Regulators in March 2007 and supported its planned work programme.
The FSF also took stock of the recent progress of accounting standard setters
in addressing various international issues, including ongoing efforts to
harmonise accounting standards and to ensure consistent interpretation of
standards.
The FSF’s offshore financial centre (OFC) Review Group assessed the
progress made by its member bodies to promote further improvements in
OFCs, notably in effective cross-border cooperation and information exchange
and the adequacy of supervisory resources. The FSF has started a review of
its OFCs initiative, which it will discuss in September 2007.

International Association of Insurance Supervisors
The International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS), hosted by the
BIS since 1998, aims to contribute to global financial stability through improved
supervision of the insurance industry, the development of standards for
supervision, international cooperation based on exchange of information, and
mutual assistance. In collaboration with other international regulatory bodies
(in the framework of the Joint Forum of the Basel Committee, IOSCO and
the IAIS), the IAIS has also helped develop principles for the supervision of
financial conglomerates. The continuous increase in new members and
observers reflects the growing recognition of the IAIS’s role.
During the past year, the IAIS took major steps in the following five areas.

Accounting
The IAIS finalised a comment paper, Issues arising as a result of the IASB’s
Insurance Contracts Project – Phase II: second set of IAIS observations,
as input into the International Accounting Standards Board’s Phase II project.
The paper sets out a number of principles, or key observations, on
measurement themes common to both general purpose financial reporting
and regulatory reporting. The principles identified include various features of
insurance liability measurement, risk margins and aspects of life insurance
accounting.

Capital adequacy and solvency
The IAIS is progressively building a common structure and common standards
for the assessment of insurer solvency, which will serve to enhance the
transparency and comparability of insurers worldwide. This will benefit

174

BIS 77th Annual Report

consumers, the industry, investors and other interested parties. A standard
and a supporting issues paper on asset-liability management (ALM) were
developed and adopted in October, the first in a suite of standards proposed
under the IAIS Framework for Insurance Supervision, and detailed in the
Roadmap Paper (A new framework for insurance supervision: towards a
common structure and common standards for the assessment of insurer
solvency). In February 2007, building on the earlier Cornerstones for the
formulation of regulatory financial requirements, the IAIS approved the IAIS
common structure for the assessment of insurer solvency, which provides a
basis for the IAIS to develop its standards and guidance on this topic by
presenting a coherent risk-based methodology for the setting of regulatory
financial requirements.

Reinsurance
The revised IAIS guidance paper on Risk transfer, disclosure and analysis of
finite reinsurance, adopted in October 2006, outlines the background on the
development of finite reinsurance and the uses of this product by insurers, as
well as issues in finite reinsurance and various supervisory approaches to
address them. The revision addresses the sections on life insurance and
reflects the latest developments in accounting for reinsurance contracts. In
November 2006, the IAIS published the third edition of its Global reinsurance
market report. The report reviews the overall financial health of the sector in
2005, an exceptional year for the reinsurance market, with unprecedented
levels of losses due to natural catastrophes.

Information sharing
Recognising that supervisors must collaborate at both the national and
international levels to ensure that insurers and reinsurers are supervised
effectively, the IAIS adopted a Multilateral memorandum of understanding
(MMOU) for the sharing of information between supervisors in February 2007.
It defines a set of principles and procedures for sharing information, views
and assessments, and provides a more efficient basis on which to make such
sharing possible.

Training
During the past year, the IAIS organised or assisted in some 20 seminars,
conferences and workshops around the world, in collaboration with the FSI.
The IAIS also completed the Core Curriculum project, the result of a successful
partnership between the IAIS and the World Bank Group in developing material
for use in training insurance supervisors on the key elements of the IAIS
Insurance Core Principles.
IAIS website: www.iaisweb.org.

International Association of Deposit Insurers
The International Association of Deposit Insurers (IADI), hosted by the BIS
since 2002, contributes to the stability of financial systems by promoting

BIS 77th Annual Report

175

international cooperation and encouraging wide international contact among
deposit insurers and other interested parties. In particular, IADI:
• enhances the understanding of common interests and issues related to
deposit insurance;
• sets out guidance to foster the effectiveness of deposit insurance systems;
• facilitates the sharing of expertise on deposit insurance issues through
training, development and educational programmes; and
• provides advice on the establishment of effective deposit insurance
systems, and the enhancement of existing systems.
Currently, 66 organisations (of which 47 are members) from around the
world are involved in IADI’s activities, including a number of central banks that
have an interest in promoting the adoption or operation of effective deposit
insurance systems. One of the main thrusts of IADI’s efforts to improve the
effectiveness of deposit insurance systems is the development of IADI
principles and best practices which focus on what is working particularly well
in various jurisdictions and the reasons why.
During its fifth year of operation, IADI continued to provide many forums
for deposit insurers and others with related interests. Highlights were:
• the Fifth Annual Conference, with the theme “Raising the bar”, held in Rio
de Janeiro in November 2006 and attended by 160 deposit insurers and
policymakers from 46 countries;
• an exposition organised by IADI, at which 32 organisations from systems
around the world provided information on the key characteristics of their
depositor protection arrangements;
• a two-day international seminar on enterprise risk management, held in
Kuala Lumpur in September 2006; and
• the conference on “International financial instability: cross-border banking
and national regulation” held in Chicago in October 2006, in conjunction
with the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.
In 2006, IADI published Guidance on interrelationships among safety net
players, the latest in a series of guidance papers following the initial publication
of Guidance for developing effective deposit insurance systems by the FSF
Working Group on Deposit Insurance in 2001, and a guidance paper on
dealing with bank resolutions. Furthermore, the IADI Research and Guidance
Committee is finalising other guidance papers on claims and recovery,
governance, funding and effective deposit insurance mandates, to be published
in mid-2007.
In October 2006, a special issue on deposit insurance was published by
the Journal of Banking Regulation, co-authored by academics, the IADI
Secretary General and deposit insurance practitioners.
Recent regional activities have included conferences, seminars and
Committee meetings in Abuja, Prague, Marrakesh, Rio de Janeiro, Washington
DC, Kuala Lumpur and Hanoi.
A new interactive web portal has been launched to facilitate research and
to provide information on deposit insurance topics and activities to members
and participants.

BIS 77th Annual Report

Financial services of the Bank

Banking services
The BIS offers a wide range of financial services designed specifically to assist
central banks and other monetary authorities in the management of their
foreign reserves. Some 130 such authorities, as well as a number of
international institutions, make active use of these services.
In response to the diverse – and constantly evolving – needs of central
banks, the BIS offers an extensive array of investment possibilities in terms of
currency denomination, liquidity and maturity. In addition to traditional money
market placements such as sight/notice accounts and fixed-term deposits, the
Bank offers two instruments that can be traded (bought and sold back) directly
with it: the Fixed-Rate Investment at the BIS (FIXBIS), available in maturities
from one week to one year; and the BIS Medium-Term Instrument (MTI), with
maturities from one year up to 10 years. A series of callable MTI structures, as
well as other instruments with embedded optionality, are also part of the
standard product range.
Safety and liquidity are the key features of these credit intermediation
services, which are supported by a rigorous internal risk management
framework. In accordance with best practice, a separate risk control unit
reporting directly to the Deputy General Manager – and through him to the
General Manager – monitors the Bank’s credit, liquidity and market risks.
Similarly, a compliance and operational risk unit monitors the Bank’s
operational risks.
The BIS makes spot, forward and option transactions in foreign exchange
and gold on behalf of its customers.
From time to time, the Bank extends short-term credits to central banks,
usually on a collateralised basis. It also acts as trustee and collateral agent
(see below).
The BIS provides asset management services in sovereign securities or
high-grade assets. These may take the form of either a specific portfolio
mandate negotiated between the BIS and a central bank or an open-end fund
structure – the BIS Investment Pool (BISIP) – allowing customers to invest
in a common pool of assets. Two Asian Bond Funds (ABF1 and ABF2) are
administered by the BIS under the BISIP umbrella: ABF1 is managed by the
BIS and ABF2 by a group of external fund managers.
BIS financial services are provided out of two linked trading rooms: one at
its Basel head office and one at its Asian Office in Hong Kong SAR.

Operations of the Banking Department in 2006/07
The BIS balance sheet continued to expand in 2006/07 to reach a financial
year-end record at 31 March 2007 of SDR 270.9 billion, a substantial year-onyear increase of SDR 50.8 billion, or 23%. Of this increase, SDR 1.0 billion was
attributable to a higher market price of gold. On the other hand, if exchange rates
had remained constant, the increase would have been SDR 1.7 billion greater.

The sum of the bars indicates total customer placements.

Liabilities
The size of the BIS balance sheet is mainly driven by placements from
customers, which constitute the vast majority of total liabilities (see graph).
On 31 March 2007, customer placements amounted to SDR 234.9 billion,
compared with SDR 195.2 billion at the end of the previous financial year.
Around 95% of customer placements are denominated in currencies,
with the remainder in gold. Currency deposits rose from SDR 186.0 billion
a year ago to SDR 221.8 billion at end-March 2007, representing some 6%
of the world’s total foreign exchange reserves of nearly SDR 3.5 trillion,
up from SDR 3.0 trillion at end-March 2006. The share of currency
placements denominated in US dollars was 62%, whereas eurodenominated funds accounted for 21%. Gold deposits amounted to
SDR 13.1 billion at end-March 2007, an increase of SDR 3.9 billion over the
financial year, of which valuation effects (ie a higher gold price) accounted
for SDR 0.8 billion.
In terms of products, the expansion in customer currency placements was
mainly attributable to a 45% increase in investments in MTIs, the single largest
BIS instrument held by customers.
A breakdown by geographical region of placements with the BIS over
the financial year shows a relatively stable pattern, with Asian customers
accounting for the highest share.

Assets
Most of the assets of the BIS consist of investments with top-quality
commercial banks of international standing as well as in government
and quasi-government securities, and reverse repurchase agreements. In
addition, the Bank owned 150 tonnes of fine gold at 31 March 2007, having
disposed of 15 tonnes during the financial year. The credit exposure is
managed in a very conservative manner, with 99.7% of the Bank’s credit

178

BIS 77th Annual Report

exposure rated A– or higher as at 31 March 2007 (see note 4D to the
financial statements).
The Bank’s holdings of currency deposits and securities, including reverse
repurchase agreements, totalled SDR 247.9 billion on 31 March 2007, up from
SDR 199.2 billion at the end of the previous financial year. These additional
funds were for the most part invested in top-quality commercial bank deposits,
high-grade securities and reverse repurchase agreements against government
collateral.
The Bank uses various derivative instruments in order to manage its
assets and liabilities efficiently (see note 9 to the financial statements).

Agent and trustee functions
Trustee for international government loans
The Bank continued during the year to perform its functions as trustee for the
funding bonds 1990–2010 of the Dawes and Young Loans (for details, see
the 63rd Annual Report of June 1993). The Deutsche Bundesbank, as paying
agent, notified the Bank that in 2006 the Bundesamt für zentrale Dienste und
offene Vermögensfragen (BADV – German Federal Office for Central Services
and Unresolved Property Issues) had arranged for payment of approximately
€4.9 million for redemption of funding bonds and interest. Redemption values
and other details were published by the BADV in the Bundesanzeiger (Federal
Gazette).
The Bank maintained its reservations regarding the application by the
BADV of the exchange guarantee clause for the Young Loan (stated in detail in
its 50th Annual Report of June 1980), which also extend to the funding bonds
1990–2010.

Escrow agent functions
The Bank performed its functions as escrow agent under a Depository and
Escrow Agreement with the Central Bank of Nigeria dated 31 October 2005
(described in the 76th Annual Report of June 2006). Its obligations under this
Agreement ceased with the last release of funds in February 2007, ie three
months ahead of the scheduled termination date of 31 May 2007.

Collateral agent functions
Under a number of agreements the BIS acts as collateral agent to hold
and invest collateral for the benefit of the holders of certain foreign
currency denominated bonds issued by countries under external debt
restructuring arrangements. During 2006/07, collateral pledge agreements
included those for Peruvian bonds (see the 67th Annual Report of June 1997)
and Côte d’Ivoire bonds (see the 68th Annual Report of June 1998). The
functions of the BIS as collateral agent under the collateral pledge agreements
for Brazilian bonds (described in the 64th Annual Report of June 1994)
terminated in June 2006 upon Brazil’s early repurchase of all outstanding
bonds.

Institutional and administrative matters

The Bank’s administration
Budget policy
The process of formulating the Bank’s expenditure budget for the coming
financial year starts about six months in advance with the setting by
Management of a broad business orientation and financial framework. Within
this context, business areas specify their plans and the corresponding resource
requirements. The process of reconciling detailed business plans, objectives and
overall resource availability culminates in the determination of a draft financial
budget. This must be approved by the Board before the start of the financial year.
In drawing up the budget, a distinction is made between administrative
and capital expenditures. In common with other organisations of a similar
nature to the BIS, expenditures for management and staff, including
remuneration, pensions and health and accident insurance, amount to around
70% of administrative costs. The other major expenditure categories, each
accounting for around 10% of administrative spending, are IT and
telecommunications and building and equipment expenditure. Capital spending
mainly relates to building and IT investment expenditure, and can vary
significantly from year to year. Most of the Bank’s administrative and capital
expenditure is incurred in Swiss francs.
Administrative expenses before depreciation during the financial year
2006/07 amounted to 227.3 million Swiss francs, 2.0% below the budget of
232.0 million Swiss francs,2 while capital expenditure, at 21.3 million Swiss
francs, was 4.9 million below budget. The underspending in administrative
expenses was attributable principally to lower expenditure on staff expatriation
allowances, personnel-related costs and IT and telecommunications expenses.
Administrative and capital expenditure also reflected the priorities set in
the 2006/07 budget, which were to:
• expand BIS services to deepen relations with shareholding member
central banks in the Asia-Pacific region. This initiative involves a threeyear policy-oriented research programme on monetary and financial sector
issues in Asia, which began in autumn 2006;
• implement the results of the activity review undertaken during 2005/06.
This review identified a number of areas where efficiency gains can be
realised. The implementation of the activity review will, over the next few
years, produce efficiency gains that will allow staff positions to be
reallocated to priority areas, particularly to enhance services to central
banks; and
• reinforce building safety, renew meeting facilities in the Tower building in
Basel and renovate the BIS Sports Club buildings.

2
The Bank’s budgetary accounting is cash-based and excludes certain financial accounting adjustments,
principally relating to retirement benefit obligations, which take into account financial market and actuarial
developments. These additional factors are included under “Operating expense” disclosed in the profit
and loss account (see “Net profit and its distribution”).

180

BIS 77th Annual Report

In March 2007, the Board approved an increase in the administrative
budget for the financial year 2007/08 of 2.9% to 238.8 million Swiss francs. The
capital budget foresees a decrease of 1.2 million Swiss francs to 24.7 million.
The main emphasis in the budget for 2007/08 is on strengthening existing
business activities further. In addition to continuing the priorities of the 2006/07
budget mentioned above, the Bank has two further objectives for the financial
year 2007/08. These are to:
• strengthen financial reporting and control, principally in the General
Secretariat and the back office and support functions in the Banking
Department. This initiative complements the enhancements made in
recent years to the Bank’s risk management, internal audit and
compliance functions; and
• plan for the enhanced business continuity facilities and arrangements that
will be implemented in 2008/09 at a site in Europe remote from Basel.

Remuneration policy
The jobs performed by BIS staff members are assessed on the basis of a
number of objective criteria, including qualifications, experience and
responsibilities, and are classified into distinct job grades. The job grades are
associated with a structure of salary ranges. Regular salary surveys are
conducted in which the structure of BIS salaries is assessed against that in
comparable institutions or market segments. The analysis takes into account
differences in the taxation of salaries of the staff of the surveyed institutions.
When applying the market data to BIS salaries, the Bank focuses on the upper
half of market salaries in order to attract highly qualified staff.
In those years in which no comprehensive salary survey is undertaken,
the salary structure is adjusted for the rate of inflation in Switzerland and the
average rise in real salaries in the business sector of major industrial countries.
In July 2006 the salary structure was increased by 1.5% in nominal terms.
Movements of salaries of individual staff members within the ranges of the
salary structure are based on merit, subject to a regular evaluation of
performance. In 2006, the performance review process was revised and a new
electronic system was put in place in February 2007.
Non-Swiss and non-locally hired staff, including senior management, are
entitled to an expatriation allowance. This currently amounts to 14% or 18%
of annual salary depending on family status, subject to a ceiling. Expatriate
staff are also entitled to receive an education allowance.3 In addition, BIS staff
members have access through the Bank to a contributory health insurance
scheme and a defined benefit contributory pension plan. Compensation and
benefits of staff members transferred between Basel and one of the
Representative Offices are determined in accordance with the Bank’s
international assignment policy.
It was decided in early 2005 to conduct regular surveys to benchmark
senior officials’ salaries against conditions in comparator institutions. Between

are not entitled to receive education allowances.

surveys, salaries of senior officials are adjusted for Swiss inflation. As of 1 July
2006, the annual remuneration of senior officials, before expatriation
allowances, is based on the following salary structure:
726,990 Swiss francs
• General Manager 4
615,140 Swiss francs
• Deputy General Manager
Heads
of
Department
559,220 Swiss francs
•
The Annual General Meeting approves the remuneration of members of
the Board of Directors, with adjustments taking place every three years. The
overall fixed annual remuneration paid to the Board of Directors amounts to
a total of 992,760 Swiss francs as at 1 April 2007. In addition, Board members
receive an attendance fee for each Board meeting in which they participate.
Assuming the full Board is represented in all Board meetings, the annual total
of these attendance fees amounts to 921,120 Swiss francs.

Net profit and its distribution

Net profit
The net profit for the 77th financial year, 2006/07, amounted to
SDR 639.4 million, compared with SDR 599.2 million in the preceding year.

Total operating income
Total operating income was SDR 682.3 million in the financial year 2006/07,
compared with SDR 573.4 million in 2005/06. There were three principal
reasons for this development:
• Interest income from investment securities benefited from higher interest
yields and, to a lesser extent, from the growth in the Bank’s equity
denominated in currencies, which increased as a result of retained
earnings and sales of own gold holdings.
• Net income from the Bank’s deposit-taking business benefited from the
continued increase in deposits from customers, which outweighed a
decline in borrowed funds margins.
• In 2006/07, a small net exchange gain (SDR 0.9 million) was incurred.
This compared to an exchange loss of SDR 25.2 million in 2005/06, which
was mainly attributable to the impact of an appreciating gold price on the
market value of forward contracts for the sale of own gold in that financial
year.

Operating expense
Operating expenses (see note 28 to the financial statements) amounted to
SDR 149.8 million, 2.0% above the preceding year’s figure of SDR 146.9 million.
Administrative expenses before depreciation amounted to SDR 137.7 million,
3.1% above the previous year’s figure of SDR 133.6 million. The depreciation
charge decreased from SDR 13.3 million to SDR 12.1 million.

4
In addition to the basic salary, the General Manager receives an annual representation allowance and
enhanced pension rights.

182

BIS 77th Annual Report

Operating profit and other profit items
The Bank’s operating profit, which reflects the profits of its ongoing business,
amounted to SDR 532.5 million, 24.9% higher than the equivalent figure of
SDR 426.5 million recorded in 2005/06.
A net loss of SDR 27.0 million was incurred on the sale of investment
securities during the year. This resulted from the realignment of the Bank’s
investment portfolio to its underlying benchmark position and reflected the sale
of securities acquired when interest rates were lower. In 2005/06, a gain of
SDR 58.2 million had been recorded for the sale of investment securities.
The realised gain of SDR 133.9 million on sales of gold investment assets
during 2006/07 arose from the sale of 15 tonnes from the Bank’s total holdings
of 165 tonnes at 31 March 2006. In 2005/06, a lower gain (SDR 114.5 million)
had been recorded, also on the sale of 15 tonnes of the Bank’s own gold.

Dividend policy
During the financial year 2005/06, the Board reviewed the dividend policy of
the BIS, taking into consideration the Bank’s capital needs and the interests of
BIS shareholders in obtaining a fair and sustainable return on their investments
in BIS shares. The Board concluded that the approach of increasing the
dividend by SDR 10 each year continued to be broadly consistent with these
considerations. This approach resulted in an increase in the dividend from
SDR 235 per share in 2004/05 to SDR 245 in 2005/06. The Board also decided
to review the dividend policy every two to three years, taking into account
changing circumstances where necessary.
The Board proposes that the dividend for 2006/07 be increased again by
SDR 10 to SDR 255 per share. The next Board review of the level of the
dividend will take place in the financial year 2007/08.

Proposed distribution of the net profit for the year
On the basis of Article 51 of the Statutes, the Board of Directors recommends
to the Annual General Meeting that the net profit of SDR 639.4 million for the
financial year 2006/07 be applied by the General Meeting in the following
manner:
1. SDR 139.3 million in payment of a dividend of SDR 255 per share;
2. SDR 50.0 million to be transferred to the general reserve fund; 5
3. SDR 6.0 million to be transferred to the special dividend reserve fund;
4. SDR 444.1 million, representing the remainder of the available net profit,
to be transferred to the free reserve fund. This fund can be used by the
Board of Directors for any purpose that is in conformity with the Statutes.
If approved by the Annual General Meeting, the dividend will be paid on
2 July 2007 according to each shareholder’s instructions in any constituent

5
Since the general reserve fund exceeded four times the Bank’s paid-up capital at 31 March 2006,
Article 51 of the Bank’s Statutes requires that 10% of the profit after payment of the dividend shall be paid
into this fund, until its balance equals five times the paid-up capital.

currency of the SDR, or in Swiss francs, to the shareholders named in the
Bank’s share register on 31 March 2007. The proposed dividend of SDR 255
per share for the financial year 2006/07 represents a 4.1% increase over the
dividend for 2005/06.
The full dividend will be paid on 546,125 shares. The number of issued
and paid-up shares is 547,125. Of these shares, 1,000 were held in treasury at
31 March 2007, namely the suspended shares of the Albanian issue. No
dividend will be paid on these treasury shares.

Report of the auditors
The Bank’s financial statements have been duly audited by Deloitte AG, who
have confirmed that they give a true and fair view of the Bank’s financial
position at 31 March 2007 and the results of its operations for the year then
ended. Their report is to be found immediately following the financial
statements.

In accordance with Article 15 of its Statutes, the Bank’s capital is held by central banks only. The legal
status of the Yugoslav issue of the capital of the BIS is currently under review following the constitutional
changes in February 2003 that transformed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia into the State Union of
Serbia and Montenegro, with two separate central banks, and the Republic of Montenegro’s subsequent

Notes to the financial statements

1. Introduction

B. Functional and presentation currency

The Bank for International Settlements (BIS, “the Bank”) is
an international financial institution which was established
pursuant to the Hague Agreements of 20 January 1930,
the Bank’s Constituent Charter and its Statutes. The
headquarters of the Bank are at Centralbahnplatz 2, 4002
Basel, Switzerland. The Bank maintains representative
offices in Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region of the
People’s Republic of China (for Asia and the Pacific) and in
Mexico City, Mexico (for the Americas).

The functional and presentation currency of the Bank is
the Special Drawing Right (SDR) as defined by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF).

The objectives of the BIS, as laid down in Article 3 of its
Statutes, are to promote cooperation among central banks,
to provide additional facilities for international financial
operations and to act as trustee or agent for international
financial settlements. Fifty-five central banks are currently
members of the Bank. Rights of representation and voting
at General Meetings are exercised in proportion to the
number of BIS shares issued in the respective countries.
The Board of Directors of the Bank is composed of the
Governors and appointed Directors from the Bank’s
founder central banks, being those of Belgium, France,
Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States
of America, as well as the Governors of the central banks of
Canada, China, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Sweden
and Switzerland, and the President of the European Central
Bank.
These financial statements incorporate the balance sheet
and profit and loss account, as required by Article 49 of the
Bank’s Statutes.

The SDR is calculated from a basket of major trading
currencies according to Rule O–1 as adopted by the
Executive Board of the IMF on 30 December 2005 and
effective 1 January 2006. As currently calculated, one SDR
is equivalent to the sum of USD 0.632, EUR 0.410, JPY 18.4
and GBP 0.0903. Prior to 1 January 2006, the SDR was
calculated as equivalent to the sum of USD 0.577,
EUR 0.426, JPY 21 and GBP 0.0984. The change in
composition of the SDR basket was such that the values of
the SDR under the old and new baskets were equivalent at
31 December 2005 and no significant gains or losses
resulted from the change in the weights of the currencies.
The composition of this currency basket is subject to
review every five years by the IMF; the next review is due
to be undertaken in December 2010.
All figures in these financial statements are presented in
SDR millions unless otherwise stated.

C. Currency translation
Monetary assets and liabilities are translated into SDR
at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Other assets and liabilities are recorded in SDR at the
exchange rates ruling at the date of the transaction. Profits
and losses are translated into SDR at an average rate.
Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of
monetary assets and liabilities and from the settlement of
transactions are included as net foreign exchange gains or
losses in the profit and loss account.

2. Significant accounting policies
The accounting policies set out below have been applied to
both of the financial years presented unless otherwise
stated.

A. Scope of the financial statements
These financial statements contain all assets and liabilities
that are controlled by the Bank and in respect of which the
economic benefits as well as the rights and obligations lie
predominantly with the Bank.
Assets and liabilities in the name of but not controlled by
the Bank are not included in these financial statements.
Information on off-balance sheet assets and liabilities is
disclosed in Note 35.

BIS 77th Annual Report

D. Designation of financial instruments
Upon initial recognition the Bank allocates each financial
instrument to one of the following categories:

•
•
•

Loans and receivables
At fair value through profit and loss
Available for sale

The allocation to these categories is dependent on the
nature of the financial instrument and the purpose for
which it was entered into, as described in section E below.
The resulting designation of each financial instrument
determines the accounting methodology that is applied, as
described in the accounting policies below. Where the
financial instrument is designated at fair value through
profit and loss, the Bank does not subsequently change this
designation.

197

E. Asset and liability structure

H. Sight and notice deposit account liabilities

Assets and liabilities are organised into two sets of
portfolios:

Sight and notice deposit accounts are short-term monetary
liabilities. They typically have notice periods of three days
or less and are included under the balance sheet heading
“Currency deposits”.

1. Banking portfolios
These comprise currency and gold deposit liabilities and
related banking assets and derivatives.
The Bank operates a banking business in currency and gold
on behalf of central bank customers. In this business the
Bank takes limited gold price, interest rate and foreign
currency risk.
The Bank designates all currency financial instruments in
its banking portfolios (other than cash and sight accounts
with banks, call and notice accounts and sight and notice
deposit account liabilities) as held at fair value through
profit and loss. The use of fair values in the currency
banking portfolios is described in Section I below.
All gold financial instruments in these portfolios are
designated as loans and receivables.

2. Investment portfolios
These comprise assets, liabilities and derivatives relating
principally to the investment of the Bank’s equity.
The Bank holds most of its equity in financial instruments
denominated in the constituent currencies of the SDR,
which are managed using a fixed duration benchmark of
bonds.
The relevant currency assets (other than cash and sight
accounts with banks, and call and notice accounts) are
designated as available for sale. Related securities sold
under repurchase agreements are designated as loans and
receivables.
In addition, the Bank maintains some of its equity in more
actively managed portfolios. The currency assets in these
portfolios are trading assets and as such are designated as
held at fair value through profit and loss.
The remainder of the Bank’s equity is held in gold. The
Bank’s own gold holdings are designated as available for
sale.

F. Cash and sight accounts with banks
Cash and sight accounts with banks are included in the
balance sheet at their principal value plus accrued interest
where applicable.

G. Call and notice accounts

Due to their short-term nature, these financial instruments
are designated as loans and receivables. They are included
in the balance sheet at their principal value plus accrued
interest. Interest is included in interest expense on an
accruals basis.

I. Use of fair values in the currency banking portfolios
In operating its currency banking business, the Bank acts
as a market-maker in certain of its currency deposit
liabilities. As a result of this activity the Bank incurs
realised profits and losses on these liabilities.
In accordance with the Bank’s risk management policies
the market risk inherent in this activity is managed on
an overall fair value basis, combining all the relevant
assets, liabilities and derivatives in its currency banking
portfolios. The realised and unrealised profits or losses on
currency deposit liabilities are thus largely offset by
realised and unrealised losses or profits on the related
currency assets and derivatives, or on other currency
deposit liabilities.
To reduce the accounting inconsistency that would arise
from recognising realised and unrealised gains and losses
on different bases, the Bank designates the relevant assets,
liabilities and derivatives in its currency banking portfolios
as held at fair value through profit and loss.

J. Currency deposit liabilities held at fair value
through profit and loss
As described above, all currency deposit liabilities, with
the exception of sight and notice deposit account
liabilities, are designated as held at fair value through
profit and loss.
These currency deposit liabilities are initially included in
the balance sheet on a trade date basis at cost. The
subsequent accrual of interest to be paid and amortisation
of premiums paid and discounts received are included in
“Interest expense”.
After trade date, the currency deposit liabilities are
revalued to fair value, with all realised and unrealised
movements in fair value included under the profit and loss
account heading “Net valuation movement”.

Call and notice accounts are short-term monetary assets.
They typically have notice periods of three days or less and
are included under the balance sheet heading “Time
deposits and advances to banks”.
Due to their short-term nature, these financial instruments
are designated as loans and receivables. They are included
in the balance sheet at their principal value plus accrued
interest. Interest is included in interest income on an
accruals basis.

198

BIS 77th Annual Report

K. Currency assets held at fair value through profit
and loss

The treatment of realised and unrealised gains or losses on
gold is described in Section Q below.

Currency assets include treasury bills, securities purchased
under resale agreements, time deposits and advances to
banks and government and other securities.

O. Gold deposit assets

As described above, the Bank designates all of the relevant
assets in its currency banking portfolios as held at fair
value through profit and loss. In addition, the Bank
maintains certain actively managed investment portfolios.
The currency assets in these portfolios are trading assets
and as such are designated as held at fair value through
profit and loss.

Gold deposit assets comprise fixed-term gold loans to
commercial banks. Gold is considered by the Bank to be a
financial instrument.

These currency assets are initially included in the balance
sheet on a trade date basis at cost. The subsequent accrual
of interest and amortisation of premiums paid and
discounts received are included in “Interest income”.

Interest on gold deposit assets is included in interest
income on an accruals basis. The treatment of realised and
unrealised gains or losses on gold is described in Section
Q below.

After trade date, the currency assets are revalued to fair
value, with all realised and unrealised movements in fair
value included under the profit and loss account heading
“Net valuation movement”.

L. Currency assets available for sale
Currency assets include treasury bills, securities purchased
under resale agreements, time deposits and advances to
banks, and government and other securities.
As described above, the Bank designates as available for
sale all of the relevant assets in its currency investment
portfolios, except for those assets in the Bank’s more
actively managed investment portfolios.
These currency assets are initially included in the balance
sheet on a trade date basis at cost. The subsequent accrual
of interest and amortisation of premiums paid and
discounts received are included in “Interest income”.
After trade date, the currency assets are revalued to fair
value, with unrealised gains or losses included in the
securities revaluation account, which is reported under the
balance sheet heading “Other equity accounts”. Realised
profits on disposal are included under the profit and loss
heading “Net gain on sales of securities available for sale”.

Gold deposit assets are included in the balance sheet on a
trade date basis at their weight in gold (translated at the
gold market price and USD exchange rate into SDR) plus
accrued interest.

P. Gold deposit liabilities
Gold deposit liabilities comprise sight and fixed-term
deposits of gold from central banks. Gold is considered by
the Bank to be a financial instrument and gold deposit
liabilities are designated as loans and receivables.
Gold deposit liabilities are included in the balance sheet on
a trade date basis at their weight in gold (translated at the
gold market price and USD exchange rate into SDR) plus
accrued interest.
Interest on gold deposit liabilities is included in interest
expense on an accruals basis. The treatment of realised
and unrealised gains or losses on gold is described in
Section Q below.

Q. Realised and unrealised gains or losses on gold
The treatment of realised and unrealised gains or losses on
gold depends on the designation as described below:

1. Banking portfolios, comprising gold deposit
liabilities and related gold banking assets
The Bank designates all the gold financial instruments in its
banking portfolios as loans and receivables.

M. Short positions in currency assets
Short positions in currency assets are included in the
balance sheet under the heading “Other liabilities” at
market value on a trade date basis.

Gains or losses on these transactions in gold are included
under the profit and loss account heading “Net foreign
exchange gain or loss” as net transaction gains or losses.
Gains or losses on the retranslation of the net position in
gold in the banking portfolios are included under the profit
and loss account heading “Net foreign exchange gain or
loss” as net translation gains or losses.

N. Gold
Gold comprises gold bars held in sight accounts. Gold is
considered by the Bank to be a financial instrument.
Gold is included in the balance sheet at its weight in gold
(translated at the gold market price and USD exchange rate
into SDR). Purchases and sales of gold are accounted for on
a settlement date basis. Forward purchases or sales of gold
are treated as derivatives prior to the settlement date.

BIS 77th Annual Report

2. Investment portfolios, comprising gold investment
assets
The Bank’s own holdings of gold are designated and
accounted for as available for sale assets.
Unrealised gains or losses on the Bank’s gold investment
assets over their deemed cost are taken to the gold
revaluation account in equity, which is reported under the
balance sheet heading “Other equity accounts”.

199

For gold investment assets held on 31 March 2003 (when
the Bank changed its functional and presentation currency
from the gold franc to the SDR) the deemed cost is
approximately SDR 151 per ounce, based on the value of
USD 208 that was applied from 1979 to 2003 following a
decision by the Bank’s Board of Directors, translated at the
31 March 2003 exchange rate.
Realised gains or losses on disposal of gold investment
assets are included in the profit and loss account as “Net
gain on sales of gold investment assets”.

R. Securities sold under repurchase agreements
Where these liabilities are associated with the management
of currency assets at fair value through profit and loss,
they are designated as financial instruments held at fair
value through profit and loss. Where these liabilities are
associated with currency assets available for sale, they are
designated as loans and receivables.
They are initially included in the balance sheet on a trade
date basis at cost. The subsequent accrual of interest is
included in “Interest expense”.
After trade date, those liabilities that are designated as at
fair value through profit and loss are revalued to fair value,
with unrealised gains or losses included under the profit
and loss account heading “Net valuation movement”.

To derive fair value for financial instruments that are
quoted in active markets, the Bank uses market quotes that
are regularly available from market participants, such as
market prices, or interest rates and volatilities that are used
as inputs to commonly used valuation techniques. Where
no active market exists, or where reliable and regularly
quoted market prices are not otherwise available, the Bank
determines fair values based on financial models using a
discounted cash flow analysis. A discounted cash flow
analysis is dependent on estimates of future cash flows,
interest rates, exchange rates and prepayment speeds, and
upon credit, liquidity and volatility factors.
Although a significant degree of judgment is, in some
cases, required in establishing fair values, the Bank
believes the fair values recorded in the balance sheet and
the changes in fair values recorded in the profit and loss
account are appropriate and reflect the underlying
economic situation.

U. Accounts receivable and accounts payable
Accounts receivable and accounts payable are principally
very short-term amounts relating to the settlement of
financial transactions. They are included in the balance
sheet at cost.

V. Land, buildings and equipment
S. Derivatives
Derivatives are used either to manage the Bank’s market
risk or for trading purposes. They are designated as
financial instruments held at fair value through profit and
loss.
They are initially included in the balance sheet on a trade
date basis at cost. The subsequent accrual of interest and
amortisation of premiums paid and discounts received are
included in “Interest income”.
After trade date, derivatives are revalued to fair value, with
all realised and unrealised movements in value included
under the profit and loss account heading “Net valuation
movement”.
Derivatives are included as either assets or liabilities,
depending on whether the contract has a positive or a
negative fair value for the Bank.

T. Valuation policy
As described in these accounting policies, the Bank
includes most of its financial instruments in its balance
sheet at fair value, and includes most changes in fair value
in profit and loss. The fair value of a financial instrument is
defined as the amount at which the instrument could be
exchanged between knowledgeable, willing parties in an
arm’s length transaction. Key judgments affecting this
accounting policy relate to how the Bank determines fair
value for financial instruments.

200

The cost of the Bank’s buildings and equipment is
capitalised and depreciated on a straight line basis over the
estimated useful lives of the assets concerned, as follows:
Buildings – 50 years
Building installations and machinery – 15 years
Information technology equipment – up to 4 years
Other equipment – 4 to 10 years
The Bank’s land is not depreciated. The Bank undertakes an
annual review of impairment of land, buildings and
equipment. Where the carrying amount of an asset is
greater than its estimated recoverable amount, it is written
down to that amount.

W. Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Bank has a present
legal or constructive obligation as a result of events arising
before the balance sheet date and it is probable that
economic resources will be required to settle the
obligation, provided that a reliable estimate can be made
of the amount of the obligation. Best estimates and
assumptions are used when determining the amount to
be recognised as a provision.

BIS 77th Annual Report

X. Post-employment benefit obligations
The Bank operates three post-employment benefit
arrangements for staff pensions, directors’ pensions and
health and accident insurance for current and former
staff members. An independent actuarial valuation is
performed annually for each arrangement.

Staff pensions
The Bank provides a final salary defined benefit pension
arrangement for its staff, based on a fund without separate
legal personality, out of which benefits are paid. The fund
assets are administered by the Bank for the sole benefit of
current and former members of staff who participate in the
arrangement. The Bank remains ultimately liable for all
benefits due under the arrangement.
The liability in respect of the staff pension fund is based on
the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the
balance sheet date, less the fair value of the fund assets at
the balance sheet date, together with adjustments for
unrecognised actuarial gains and losses and past service
costs. The defined benefit obligation is calculated using
the projected unit credit method. The present value of
the defined benefit obligation is determined from the
estimated future cash outflows. The rate used to discount
the cash flows is determined by the Bank based on the
market yield of highly rated corporate debt securities in
Swiss francs which have terms to maturity approximating
the terms of the related liability.
The amount charged to the profit and loss account
represents the sum of the current service cost of the
benefits accruing for the year under the scheme, and
interest at the discount rate on the defined benefit
obligation. In addition, actuarial gains and losses arising
from experience adjustments (where the actual outcome is
different from the actuarial assumptions previously made),
changes in actuarial assumptions and amendments to the
pension fund regulations are charged to the profit and loss
account over the service period of staff concerned in
accordance with the “Corridor accounting” methodology
described below. The resulting liabilities are included
under the heading “Other liabilities” in the balance sheet.

Directors’ pensions
The Bank provides an unfunded defined benefit
arrangement for directors’ pensions. The liability, defined
benefit obligation and amount charged to the profit and
loss account in respect of the directors’ pension
arrangement are calculated on a similar basis to that used
for the staff pension fund.

Corridor accounting
Actuarial gains or losses arise from experience
adjustments (where the actual outcome is different from
the actuarial assumptions previously made), changes in
actuarial assumptions and amendments to the pension
fund regulations. Where the cumulative unrecognised
actuarial gains or losses exceed the higher of the benefit
obligation or any assets used to fund the obligation by
more than a corridor of 10%, the resulting excess outside
the corridor is amortised over the expected remaining
service period of the staff concerned.

Y. Cash flow statement
The Bank’s cash flow statement is prepared using an
indirect method. It is based on the movements in the
Bank’s balance sheet, adjusted for changes in financial
transactions awaiting settlement.
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and sight
accounts with banks, and call and notice accounts, which
are very short-term financial assets that typically have
notice periods of three days or less.

3. Use of estimates
The preparation of the financial statements requires the
Bank’s Management to make some estimates in arriving at
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements, and the reported amounts of
income and expenses during the financial year. To arrive
at these estimates the Management uses available
information, exercises judgment and makes assumptions.
Judgment is exercised when selecting and applying the
Bank’s accounting policies. The judgments relating to
the designation and valuation of financial instruments are
a key element in the preparation of these financial
statements.
Assumptions include forward-looking estimates, for
example relating to the valuation of assets and liabilities,
the assessment of post-employment benefit obligations
and the assessment of provisions and contingent liabilities.
Subsequent actual results could differ materially from
those estimates.

Post-employment health and accident benefits
The Bank provides an unfunded post-employment health
and accident benefit arrangement for its staff. The liability,
benefit obligation and amount charged to the profit and
loss account in respect of the health and accident benefit
arrangement are calculated on a similar basis to that used
for the staff pension fund.

BIS 77th Annual Report

4. Capital and risk management
A. The risks that the Bank faces
The Bank is exposed to the following categories of risk:

Credit risk. The risk of a financial loss arising from a
counterparty’s failure to service its debt in a timely manner.
This is the largest risk that the Bank faces.
Market risk. The risk of a decline in the total value of the
Bank’s assets and liabilities due to adverse changes in such
market variables as interest rates, exchange rates and gold
prices.
Liquidity risk. The risk of being unable to meet its
obligations to pay as they fall due without incurring
unacceptable losses.
Operational risk. The risk of financial loss, or damage to
the Bank’s reputation, or both, resulting from one or more
risk factors, ie human factors, failed or inadequate
processes, failed or inadequate systems, or external
events, including legal risk.

B. How the Bank manages these risks
Organisation structure
The Bank is operated to serve the central banking
community whilst earning an adequate return to maintain
its capital strength.
The Bank manages risk through a framework including an
independent risk control function and regular reporting of
risk positions to appropriate Management committees.
The Bank’s risk methodologies and risk policies are
documented in a detailed risk manual, which is reviewed
on a regular basis.
The finance function and legal service augment the risk
control function. The role of the finance function is to
produce the Bank’s financial statements and to control its
expenditure through setting and monitoring the annual
budget. The legal service provides legal advice and
support covering a wide range of issues relating to the
Bank’s activities.
The purpose of the Bank’s compliance function is to
provide reasonable assurance that the activities of the
Bank and its staff conform with applicable laws and
regulations, the BIS Statutes, the Bank’s Code of Conduct
and other internal rules, policies and relevant standards of
sound practice. The compliance function identifies and
assesses compliance risks and guides and educates staff
on compliance issues. It also performs a monitoring,
reporting and, in cooperation with the legal service, an
advisory role.

202

The internal audit function reviews internal control
procedures and reports on how they comply with internal
standards and industry best practices. The scope of
internal audit work includes the review of risk management
procedures, internal control systems, information systems
and governance processes. Internal audit is directly
responsible to the General Manager and the Deputy
General Manager.
The Deputy General Manager is responsible for the Bank’s
risk control and compliance functions.
The head of compliance and the head of internal audit also
report regularly to the Audit Committee of the Board of
Directors.

Risk methodologies
The Bank uses a comprehensive range of quantitative
methodologies for valuing financial instruments and for
measuring risk to the Bank’s net profit and its equity.
The Bank reassesses its quantitative methodologies in the
light of its changing risk environment and evolving best
practice.
Economic capital is a key quantitative risk methodology
used by the Bank. Economic capital is a measure designed
to estimate the amount of equity needed to absorb the
potential losses arising from exposures on any given date,
to a statistical level of confidence determined by the Bank’s
aim to remain of the highest creditworthiness. Many of the
Bank’s internal limits and reports are expressed in terms of
economic capital. The Bank calculates economic capital
covering credit risk, market risk and operational risk.
To calculate economic capital for credit risk the Bank uses
an internal model for credit portfolio value-at-risk that is
based on the Bank’s assessment of:

•
•

the probability of default of individual counterparties;

•

the likely loss that the Bank would incur as a result of
the default.

the correlations of losses associated with individual
counterparties; and

The market risk economic capital measure is derived
from the Bank’s value-at-risk (VaR) methodology. This is
discussed in more detail in Section E below.
The Bank’s operational risk economic capital measure is
based on a model that incorporates the Bank’s experience
of operational losses and external loss data.
In computing its credit, market and operational risk
economic capital measures, the Bank uses as key
assumptions a one-year time horizon and a 99.995% level
of confidence.

BIS 77th Annual Report

C. Capital adequacy

1. Default risk

The Bank maintains a strong capital position, which is
measured using its economic capital model and the
framework proposed by the Basel Capital Accord of
July 1988 (the Basel Accord). The table below shows the
Bank’s capital as at 31 March 2007:

The Bank controls its default risk at both a counterparty
and a portfolio level. Credit exposures are restricted using
a series of credit limits covering individual counterparties
and countries of risk. The Bank conducts its own detailed
independent credit analysis resulting in the assignment of
internal credit grades. Based on this analysis the Bank sets
its credit limits.

The Basel Accord ratios measure capital adequacy by
comparing the Bank’s eligible capital with its risk-weighted
assets. The risk-weighted assets are derived by applying a
series of risk weightings to the Bank’s assets and derivatives,
based on the Basel Accord. The Bank’s capital ratios are
high due to the proportion of sovereign debt (which is zero
risk-weighted) within the Bank’s assets. The Bank’s Tier 1
ratio was 29.9% as at 31 March 2007 (2006: 32.4%).

D. Credit risk

Default risk on the Bank’s holdings of securities is reduced
by the highly liquid nature of most of the assets. Securities
are sold when the Bank’s Management considers that a
counterparty has an unacceptable risk of default.
Default risk on over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives is
mitigated using collateral management agreements. As at
31 March 2007 the Bank held as collateral on OTC
derivatives SDR 26.2 million nominal of G10 sovereign
securities. The Bank held no collateral on OTC derivatives
at 31 March 2006.
The vast majority of the Bank’s assets are invested
with G10 sovereigns or with financial institutions
rated A or above. Because of the limited number of
such investments, the Bank has significant individual
counterparty concentrations within these risk sectors.
The following tables show credit exposure by sector and
credit rating:

Credit risk includes:

Settlement risk – the risk of failure of the settlement or
clearing of financial transactions where the exchange of
cash, securities or other assets is not simultaneous.
Transfer risk – the risk that a counterparty is unable to meet
its foreign currency obligations due to restricted access to
foreign currency.
The Bank manages its exposure to credit risk by placing
limits on the amount of risk accepted in relation to one
borrower or a group of borrowers. Such risks are
monitored on a regular basis and are subject to at least an
annual review and will be adjusted as deemed appropriate.
The main criterion for these reviews is the ability of
borrowers and potential borrowers to meet interest and
capital repayment obligations. Limits on the level of credit
risk are approved by the Bank’s Management within a
framework set by the Board of Directors.

Default risk – the risk that a counterparty will not fulfil its
obligations in accordance with the agreed terms of a
transaction. Default risk arises on financial assets and
derivatives, as well as committed facilities that the Bank
provides for central banks and international organisations.

2. Settlement risk

1. Gold price risk

The Bank minimises settlement risk by:

Gold price risk is the potential impact on the fair value of
assets and liabilities from changes in the SDR price of
gold. The Bank is exposed to gold price risk principally
through its holdings of gold investment assets, which
comprise 150 tonnes (2006: 165 tonnes). This is held
in custody or placed on deposit with commercial banks.
At 31 March 2007 the Bank’s gold position was
SDR 2,115.2 million (2006: SDR 2,145.6 million),
approximately 17% of its equity (2006: 19%). The Bank can
also have small exposures to gold price risk through its
banking activities with central and commercial banks. Gold
price risk is measured within the Bank’s aggregate market
risk economic capital framework.

•
•

using established clearing centres;

•

where possible requiring net settlement of payments
on derivative financial instruments;

•

calculating and limiting the settlement risk on a
counterparty basis; and

•

in respect of foreign exchange transactions, ensuring
where possible that these take place subject to setoff
arrangements that would apply should a counterparty
fail to deliver the counter-currency to such a
transaction.

where possible settling transactions only once both
parties have fulfilled their obligations (the delivery
versus payment settlement mechanism);

3. Transfer risk
The Bank calculates and sets limits for transfer risk on a per
country basis.

E. Market risk
The main components of the Bank’s market risk are gold
price risk, currency risk and interest rate risk. The Bank
incurs market risk primarily through the assets relating to
the management of its equity. The Bank measures market
risk using the value-at-risk (VaR) methodology, and by
computing sensitivities to certain market risk factors.
VaR expresses the statistical estimate of the maximum
potential loss on the current portfolio assuming a specified
time horizon and measured to a specified level of
confidence.
Market risk economic capital is measured and managed on
an aggregated market risk basis. The Bank’s Management
limits the Bank’s market risk economic capital usage within
a framework set by the Board of Directors.
All VaR models, while forward-looking, are based on past
events and dependent on the quality of available market
data. VaR limits are supplemented with a framework of
other limits and reporting, including specific stress tests
and detailed monitoring of the largest market risk positions.

204

2. Currency risk
Currency risk is the potential impact on the fair value of
assets and liabilities from changes in exchange rates. The
Bank is exposed to currency risk principally through the
assets relating to the management of its equity. The Bank
is also exposed to currency risk through managing its
customer deposits and through acting as an intermediary
in foreign exchange transactions between central and
commercial banks. The Bank reduces its currency
exposures by matching the assets relating to the
management of its equity to the constituent currencies of
the SDR on a regular basis, and by allowing only small
currency exposures relating to customer deposits and
foreign exchange transaction intermediation.
The Bank’s functional currency, the SDR, is a composite
currency comprising fixed amounts of USD, EUR, JPY and
GBP. The following tables show the actual currency and
gold composition of the Bank’s assets and liabilities. The
net currency and gold position shown in these tables
therefore includes the Bank’s gold investment assets. To
arrive at the Bank’s net currency exposure an adjustment is
made to remove gold amounts. The SDR neutral position
is then deducted from the net currency position excluding
gold to arrive at the net currency exposure of the Bank on
an SDR neutral basis.

3. Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the potential impact on the fair value of
assets and liabilities from changes in interest rates. The
Bank is exposed to interest rate risk principally through the
interest bearing assets relating to the management of its
equity. These assets are managed using a fixed duration
benchmark of bonds. The Bank is also exposed to limited
interest rate risk through its activities in accepting and
reinvesting customer deposits.
The Bank closely monitors interest rate risk, including the
sensitivity of fair values to movements in interest rates.
Market risk is restricted using economic capital, VaR and
stress test-based limits.

F. Liquidity risk
Net movements in the currency and gold deposits from
central banks, international organisations and other public
institutions are the key determinants of the size of the
Bank’s balance sheet. The Bank has undertaken to

that it is able to meet the requirements of its customers at

set a limit for the Bank’s liquidity ratio which requires liquid
assets to be equal to at least 100% of the potential liquidity
requirement faced by the Bank. In addition, liquidity stress
tests are performed which assume extreme withdrawal
scenarios considerably beyond the estimated potential
liquidity requirement. These stress tests define additional
liquidity requirements which must also be met by holdings
of liquid assets. The Bank’s liquidity has consistently been
materially above its minimum liquidity ratio limit.

The Bank has developed a liquidity management
framework based on a statistical model using prudent
assumptions with regard to cash inflows and the liquidity of
liabilities. Within this framework, the Board of Directors has

G. Operational risk

5. Cash and sight accounts with banks

Operational risk is defined by the Bank as the risk of
financial loss, or damage to the Bank’s reputation, or both,
resulting from one or more risk causes, being human
factors, failed or inadequate processes, failed or
inadequate systems, or external events; it includes legal
risk, but excludes strategic risk:

Cash and sight accounts with banks consist of cash
balances with central banks and commercial banks that are
available to the Bank on demand.

•

•

•

•

Human factors: insufficient personnel, lack of requisite
knowledge, skills or experience, inadequate training
and development, inadequate supervision, loss of key
personnel, inadequate succession planning, or lack of
integrity or ethical standards;
Failed or inadequate processes: a process is poorly
designed or unsuitable, or is not properly documented,
understood, implemented, followed or enforced;
Failed or inadequate systems: a system is poorly
designed, unsuitable or unavailable, or does not
operate as intended; and
External events: the occurrence of an event having an
adverse impact on the Bank but outside its control.

In January 2007, the Board approved a framework for the
management of operational risk at the BIS. This framework
defines the expression “operational risk” and lays down
the principles of how operational risk is to be identified,
assessed, monitored, mitigated and reported. The Bank
manages operational risk through internal controls
comprising policies, procedures and organisational
structures, designed to reduce the likelihood of an
operational risk event occurring or that mitigate the
adverse consequences of such an event if it does occur.

The Bank allocates economic capital for operational risk on
the basis of a statistical model that incorporates the Bank’s
experience of operational losses as well as external loss
data.
The Bank identifies and assesses operational risks and
evaluates the effectiveness of existing controls for its key
processes through a Bank-wide Control Self-Assessment
(CSA) programme. The results of this annual assessment
are taken into account for the management of operational
risk.

B. Gold investment assets

7. Currency assets

The Bank’s gold investment assets are included in the
balance sheet at their weight in gold (translated at the gold
market price and USD exchange rate into SDR) plus
accrued interest. The excess of this value over the deemed
cost value is included in the gold revaluation account
(reported under the balance sheet heading “Other equity
accounts”), and realised gains or losses on the disposal of
gold investment assets are recognised in the profit and
loss account.

A. Total holdings

Note 21B provides further analysis of the gold revaluation
account. Note 30 provides further analysis of the net gain
on sales of gold investment assets.

year ended 31 March 2007 15 tonnes were disposed of
(see note 30). The balance at 31 March 2007 amounted to
150 tonnes of fine gold.

BIS 77th Annual Report

Currency assets comprise treasury bills, securities
purchased under resale agreements, fixed-term loans, and
government and other securities.
Currency assets held at fair value through profit and loss
comprise those currency banking assets that represent the
reinvestment of customer deposits and those currency
investment assets that are part of more actively managed
portfolios. Currency assets available for sale comprise the
remainder of the Bank’s currency investment assets and
represent, for most part, the investment of the Bank’s
equity.

Securities purchased under resale agreements (“reverse
repurchase agreements”) are transactions under which
the Bank makes a fixed-term loan to a counterparty which
provides collateral in the form of securities. The rate on the
loan is fixed at the beginning of the transaction, and there
is an irrevocable commitment to return the equivalent
securities subject to the repayment of the loan. During the
term of the agreement the fair value of collateral is
monitored, and additional collateral is obtained where
appropriate to protect against credit exposure.
Fixed-term loans are primarily investments made with
commercial banks. Also included in this category are
investments made with central banks and international
institutions, including advances made as part of committed
and uncommitted standby facilities. The balance sheet
total “Time deposits and advances to banks” also includes
call and notice accounts (see note 8).
Government and other securities are debt securities issued
by governments, international institutions, other public
institutions, commercial banks and corporates. They
include fixed and floating rate bonds and asset-backed
securities.

Interest rate and bond futures are contractual obligations
to receive or pay a net amount based on changes in interest
rates or bond prices on a future date at a specified price
established in an organised market. Futures contracts
are collateralised by cash or marketable securities and
changes in the futures contract value are settled daily with
the exchange.
Currency and bond options are contractual agreements
under which the seller grants the purchaser the right, but
not the obligation, to either buy (call option) or sell (put
option), by or on a set date, a specific amount of a currency,
a bond or gold at a predetermined price. In consideration,
the seller receives a premium from the purchaser.
Options on futures are contractual agreements that confer
the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a futures
contract at a predetermined price during a specified period
of time.
Currency and gold swaps, cross-currency interest rate
swaps and interest rate swaps are commitments to
exchange one set of cash flows for another. Swaps result in
an economic exchange of currencies, gold or interest rates
(for example, fixed rate for floating rate) or a combination
of interest rates and currencies (cross-currency interest
rate swaps). Except for certain currency and gold swaps
and cross-currency interest rate swaps, no exchange of
principal takes place.
Currency and gold forwards represent commitments to
purchase foreign currencies or gold at a future date. This
includes undelivered spot transactions.

8. Time deposits and advances to banks
Time deposits and advances to banks comprise fixed-term
loans and call and notice accounts.
Fixed-term loans are designated as fair value through
profit and loss.
Call and notice accounts are designated as loans and
receivables and are included as cash and cash equivalents.
These are very short-term financial assets, typically having
a notice period of three days or less. These are included in
the balance sheet at amortised cost.

Forward rate agreements are individually negotiated
interest rate forward contracts that result in cash
settlement at a future date for the difference between a
contracted rate of interest and the prevailing market rate.
Swaptions are options under which the seller grants the
purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to enter into a
currency or interest rate swap at a predetermined price by
or on a set date.

Currency deposits are book entry claims on the Bank. The
Bank acts as a market-maker in certain of its currency
deposit liabilities, and has undertaken to repay at fair value
these financial instruments, in whole or in part, at one to
two business days’ notice. The applicable currency deposit
instruments are analysed in the table below:

Total currency deposits

Sight and notice deposit accounts are very short-term
financial liabilities, typically having a notice period of three
days or less. They are designated as loans and receivables
and are included in the balance sheet at amortised cost.
Currency deposits (other than sight and notice deposit
accounts) are included in the balance sheet at fair value.
This value differs from the amount that the Bank is
contractually required to pay at maturity to the holder
of the deposit. For total currency deposits the amount
that the Bank is contractually required to pay at maturity
to the holder of the deposit, plus accrued interest
to 31 March 2007, is SDR 224,059.0 million (2006:
SDR 187,896.6 million).
The Bank uses financial models to estimate the fair value of
its currency deposits. These models value the expected
cash flows of financial instruments using discount factors
that are derived partly from quoted interest rates (eg Libor
and swap rates) and partly from assumptions about
spreads. The Bank determines these spreads based on
recent market transactions. In the financial year ended
31 March 2007, changes to the assumptions about spreads
used for valuing currency deposits increased the Bank’s
profit by SDR 3.2 million (2006: decreased profit by
SDR 6.0 million).

13. Gold deposit liabilities
Gold deposits placed with the Bank originate entirely from
central banks. They are all designated as loans and
receivables.

Medium-Term Instruments (MTIs) are fixed rate
investments at the BIS for quarterly maturities of up to
10 years. The Bank also offers MTIs which are callable at an
exercise price of par at the option of the Bank (callable
MTIs), with call dates between April 2007 and May 2008
(2006: April 2006 and March 2007). The amount of callable
MTIs in the balance sheet as at 31 March 2007 was
SDR 7,740.5 million (2006: SDR 6,262.9 million).
FIXBIS are fixed rate investments at the BIS for any
maturities between one week and one year.
FRIBIS are floating rate investments at the BIS with
maturities of one year or longer for which the interest rate
is reset in line with prevailing market conditions.
Fixed-term deposits are fixed rate investments at the BIS,
typically with a maturity of less than one year. The Bank
also takes fixed-term deposits that are repayable on the
maturity date either in the original currency or at a fixed
amount in a different currency at the option of the Bank
(dual currency deposits). The amount of dual currency
deposits included in the balance sheet at 31 March 2007
was SDR 6,654.9 million (2006: SDR 231.1 million). The
maturity dates of these deposits are between April and
June 2007 (2006: April and June 2006).

14. Securities sold under repurchase
agreements

17. Share capital
The Bank’s share capital consists of:

Securities sold under repurchase agreements (“repo”
liabilities) are transactions under which the Bank receives a
fixed-term deposit from a counterparty to which it provides
collateral in the form of securities. The rate on the deposit
is fixed at the beginning of the transaction, and there is an
irrevocable commitment to repay the deposit subject to
the return of equivalent securities. They originate entirely
from commercial banks.
As at 31 March 2007 and 2006 all of the securities sold
under repurchase agreements were associated with the
management of currency assets available for sale. They
are therefore all designated as loans and receivables and
are included in the balance sheet at amortised cost.

18. Statutory reserves
The Bank’s Statutes provide for application of the Bank’s
annual net profit by the Annual General Meeting on the
proposal of the Board of Directors to three specific reserve
funds: the legal reserve fund, the general reserve fund and
the special dividend reserve fund; the remainder of the net
profit after payment of any dividend is generally allocated
to the free reserve fund.

Legal reserve fund. This fund is currently fully funded at
10% of the Bank’s paid-up capital.
General reserve fund. After paying any dividend, 10% of
the remainder of the Bank’s annual net profit currently
must be allocated to the general reserve fund. When the
balance of this fund equals five times the Bank’s paid-up
capital, such annual contribution will decrease to 5% of the
remainder of the annual net profit.
Special dividend reserve fund. A portion of the remainder
of the annual net profit may be allocated to the special
dividend reserve fund, which shall be available, in case of
need, for paying the whole or any part of a declared
dividend. Dividends are normally paid out of the Bank’s net
profit.
Free reserve fund. After the above allocations have been
made, any remaining unallocated net profit is generally
transferred to the free reserve fund.
Receipts from the subscription of BIS shares are allocated
to the legal reserve fund as necessary to keep it fully
funded, with the remainder being credited to the general
reserve fund.
The free reserve fund, general reserve fund and legal
reserve fund are available, in that order, to meet any losses
incurred by the Bank. In the event of liquidation of the Bank,
the balances of the reserve funds (after the discharge of the
liabilities of the Bank and the costs of liquidation) would be
divided among the Bank’s shareholders.

19. Repurchase and subsequent redistribution
of shares
The Extraordinary General Meeting on 8 January 2001
amended the Bank’s Statutes to restrict the right to hold
shares in the BIS exclusively to central banks, thereby
effecting a mandatory repurchase from private (ie noncentral bank) shareholders of 72,648 shares on which the
American, Belgian and French central banks exercise
voting rights. At the same time the Bank repurchased
2,304 shares of these three issues from other central
banks. The total compensation paid was CHF 23,977.56
per share plus interest thereon.
The Bank held these shares in treasury and redistributed
40,119 of them, corresponding to the shares of the Belgian
and French issues held in treasury, during the financial
year ended 31 March 2005 to the central banks of those
countries. The Bank redistributed the remaining 35,933
shares of the American issue held in treasury by selling
them to shareholding central banks on 31 May 2005 (see
note 20).

In accordance with the Bank’s Statutes, the BIS shares
repurchased in early 2001 and subsequently held in
treasury (see note 19) may be redistributed by the Board
of Directors by way of sale to shareholding central
banks against payment of an amount equal to that of
the compensation paid to the former shareholders (ie
CHF 23,977.56 per share).
Consistent therewith, on 31 May 2005 the Bank
redistributed the remaining 35,933 shares of the American
issue held in treasury by selling them to shareholding
central banks at a price of CHF 23,977.56 per share. The
proceeds of this sale amounted to CHF 861.6 million,
equivalent to SDR 468.2 million at the transaction date.

Securities revaluation account

The figure of SDR 396.2 million in 2006 represents the
SDR equivalent of the cost of the compensation in Swiss
francs paid to the former shareholders of the shares at the
time of the shares repurchase in January 2001 and the final
award of the Hague Arbitral Tribunal in September 2003.
For more information on the Hague Arbitral Tribunal, see
the financial statements 2004/05, note 17. When the sale
proceeds of these shares were received in 2006, an
exchange gain of SDR 72.0 million was realised. This
resulted from the appreciation of the Swiss franc against
the SDR during the period from 2001 to the dates of sale.
The remaining shares held in treasury consist of 1,000
suspended shares of the Albanian issue.
During the financial year ended 31 March 2006 a loan from
the Bank to a consortium of central banks that related to the
suspended shares of the Albanian issue was reclassified
from accounts receivable to shares held in treasury. The
amount reclassified was SDR 1.7 million.

22. Post-employment benefit obligations

All arrangements are valued annually by independent
actuaries.

The Bank operates three post-employment arrangements:

In addition, the Bank operates a blocked personal deposit
account for certain staff members who were previously
members of the Bank’s savings fund, which closed on
1 April 2003. The terms of these blocked accounts are such
that staff members cannot make further deposits and
balances are paid out when they leave the Bank. The
accounts bear interest at a rate determined by the Bank
based on the rate offered by the Swiss National Bank on
similar staff accounts. The total balance of blocked
accounts at 31 March 2007 was SDR 18.9 million
(2006: SDR 19.4 million). They are reported under the
balance sheet heading “Currency deposits”.

1. A final salary defined benefit pension arrangement for its
staff. The pension arrangement is based on a fund without
separate legal personality, out of which benefits are paid.
The fund assets are administered by the Bank for the sole
benefit of current and former members of staff who
participate in the arrangement. The Bank remains
ultimately liable for all benefits due under the arrangement.
2. An unfunded defined benefit arrangement for its
directors, whose entitlement is based on a minimum
service period of four years.
3. An unfunded post-employment health and accident
benefit arrangement for its staff. Entitlement to this
arrangement is based in principle on the employee
remaining in service up to 50 years of age and the
completion of a minimum service period of 10 years.

resulted principally from the impact of an appreciating
gold price on the market value of forward contracts for the
sale of gold investment assets. This loss was offset by a
corresponding increase in the realised gain on the Bank’s
sales of gold investment assets (see note 30) when these
transactions were settled.

A. Total liabilities

The Bank invests the majority of its funds in the interbank
market (with G10-based global financial institutions) and
in G10 sovereign debt. A geographical analysis of the
Bank’s total assets is not provided because Management
believes that this would not present a fair impression of the
economic effect of the Bank’s investments.

The Bank offers personal deposit accounts for all staff
members and its Directors. In addition, the Bank operates
a blocked personal deposit account for certain staff
members who were previously members of the Bank’s
savings fund, which was discontinued in 2003. The terms
of these blocked accounts are such that staff members
cannot make further deposits and balances are paid out
when they leave the Bank. The personal deposit accounts
and the blocked accounts bear interest at a rate determined
by the Bank based on the rate offered by the Swiss National
Bank on similar staff accounts. The movements and total
balance on personal deposit and blocked accounts relating

40. Contingent liabilities

The Bank maintains sight accounts in currencies with
related party central banks and connected institutions,
the total balance of which was SDR 144.7 million as at
31 March 2007 (2006: SDR 10.8 million). Gold held in sight
accounts with related party central banks and connected
institutions totalled SDR 11,837.7 million as at 31 March
2007 (2006: SDR 7,132.0 million).

The Bank is indirectly involved in legal proceedings in
France arising out of the mandatory repurchase in 2001 of
the shares in the BIS held by private shareholders.

Derivative transactions with related party central
banks and connected institutions
The BIS enters into derivative transactions with its related
party central banks and connected institutions, including
foreign exchange deals and interest rate swaps. The
total nominal value of these transactions with related
party central banks and connected institutions during
the year ended 31 March 2007 was SDR 17,005.8 million
(2006: SDR 10,948.1 million).

A damages claim was initiated in September 2004 before
the Commercial Court in Paris by a group of claimants who
allegedly sold BIS shares in the market during the period
between the announcement of the proposed mandatory
share repurchase on 11 September 2000 and the resolution
on 8 January 2001 by the Extraordinary General Meeting
effectuating the repurchase. The claim was brought not
against the BIS, but rather against JP Morgan & Cie SA and
Barbier Frinault, who advised the Bank on the appropriate
compensation for the repurchase. That notwithstanding,
the Bank faces indirect liability through an indemnification
clause in its contract with JP Morgan & Cie SA with respect
to litigation and costs that might arise in connection with
the advisory services performed. No provision has been
made for this claim.
In its judgment of 9 October 2006, the Commercial Court in
Paris rejected the claim. A number of claimants have,
however, requested review of this decision by the Paris
Court of Appeals.
The BIS is not currently involved in any other significant
legal proceedings.

Report of the auditors

Report of the auditors
to the Board of Directors and to the General Meeting
of the Bank for International Settlements, Basel
We have audited the accompanying financial statements (pages 192–231) of the Bank for International
Settlements. These financial statements incorporate the balance sheet as at 31 March 2007, profit
and loss account for the year then ended as required by the Bank’s Statutes, and the notes thereto.
The financial statements have been prepared by the Management of the Bank in accordance with
the Statutes and with the principles of valuation described under significant accounting policies in
the notes. The Management of the Bank is responsible for designing, implementing and maintaining
internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; selecting and applying appropriate
accounting policies; and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.
Our responsibility under the Statutes of the Bank is to form an independent opinion on the balance
sheet and profit and loss account based on our audit and to report our opinion to you.
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those Standards
require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s
judgment, including the assessment of the risk of material misstatement of the financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers
internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements
in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit
also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness
of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of
the financial statements. We have received all the information and explanations which we have
required to obtain assurance that the balance sheet and profit and loss account are free of
material misstatement, and believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements, including the notes thereto, have been properly drawn
up and give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Bank for International Settlements
at 31 March 2007 and the results of its operations for the year then ended in conformity with the
accounting principles described in the notes to the financial statements and the Statutes of the
Bank.
