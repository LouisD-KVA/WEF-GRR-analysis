ASSUMPTIONS AND CONVENTIONS

A number of assumptions have been adopted for the projections presented in the World Economic Outlook
(WEO). It has been assumed that real effective exchange rates remained constant at their average levels during July
25, 2023–August 22, 2023, except for those currencies participating in the European exchange rate mechanism
II, which are assumed to have remained constant in nominal terms relative to the euro; that established policies
of national authorities will be maintained (for specific assumptions about fiscal and monetary policies for selected
economies, see Box A1 in the Statistical Appendix); that the average price of oil will be $80.49 a barrel in 2023
and $79.92 a barrel in 2024; that the three-month government bond yield for the United States will average
5.3 percent in 2023 and 5.4 percent in 2024, that for the euro area will average 3.0 percent in 2023 and
3.2 percent in 2024, and that for Japan will average –0.2 percent in 2023 and –0.1 percent in 2024; and that
the 10-year government bond yield for the United States will average 3.8 percent in 2023 and 4.0 percent in 2024,
that for the euro area will average 2.4 percent in 2023 and 2.6 percent in 2024, and that for Japan will average
0.5 percent in 2023 and 0.6 percent in 2024. These are, of course, working hypotheses rather than forecasts,
and the uncertainties surrounding them add to the margin of error that would, in any event, be involved in the
projections. The estimates and projections are based on statistical information available through September 25,
2023.
The following conventions are used throughout the WEO:
• ...

to indicate that data are not available or not applicable;

• – between years or months (for example, 2022–23 or January–June) to indicate the years or months covered,
including the beginning and ending years or months; and
• /

between years or months (for example, 2022/23) to indicate a fiscal or financial year.

• “Billion” means a thousand million; “trillion” means a thousand billion.
• “Basis points” refers to hundredths of 1 percentage point (for example, 25 basis points are equivalent to ¼ of
1 percentage point).
• Data refer to calendar years, except in the case of a few countries that use fiscal years. Please refer to Table F in
the Statistical Appendix, which lists the economies with exceptional reporting periods for national accounts and
government finance data for each country.
• For some countries, the figures for 2022 and earlier are based on estimates rather than actual outturns. Please
refer to Table G in the Statistical Appendix, which lists the latest actual outturns for the indicators in the
national accounts, prices, government finance, and balance of payments for each country.
What is new in this publication:
• Ecuador’s fiscal sector projections, which were previously omitted due to ongoing program discussions, are now
included.
• Eritrea’s data and projections for 2020–28 are excluded from the database due to constraints in data reporting.
• Sri Lanka’s projections for 2023–28 are excluded from publication owing to ongoing discussions on sovereign
debt restructuring.
• Ukraine’s projections for 2024–28, in line with the program’s baseline scenario, are now included.
• For West Bank and Gaza, certain projections for 2022–28 are excluded from publication pending methodological
adjustments to statistical series.

Assumptions and Conventions

In the tables and figures, the following conventions apply:
• Tables and figures in this report that list their source as “IMF staff calculations” or “IMF staff estimates” draw
on data from the WEO database.
• When countries are not listed alphabetically, they are ordered on the basis of economic size.
• Minor discrepancies between sums of constituent figures and totals shown reflect rounding.
• Composite data are provided for various groups of countries organized according to economic characteristics or
region. Unless noted otherwise, country group composites represent calculations based on 90 percent or more of
the weighted group data.
• The boundaries, colors, denominations, and any other information shown on maps do not imply, on the part of
the IMF, any judgment on the legal status of any territory or any endorsement or acceptance of such boundaries.
As used in this report, the terms “country” and “economy” do not in all cases refer to a territorial entity that is
a state as understood by international law and practice. As used here, the term also covers some territorial entities
that are not states but for which statistical data are maintained on a separate and independent basis.

PREFACE

The analysis and projections contained in the World Economic Outlook are integral elements of the IMF’s
surveillance of economic developments and policies in its member countries, of developments in international
financial markets, and of the global economic system. The survey of prospects and policies is the product of a
comprehensive interdepartmental review of world economic developments, which draws primarily on information
the IMF staff gathers through its consultations with member countries. These consultations are carried out
in particular by the IMF’s area departments—namely, the African Department, Asia and Pacific Department,
European Department, Middle East and Central Asia Department, and Western Hemisphere Department—
together with the Strategy, Policy, and Review Department; the Monetary and Capital Markets Department; and
the Fiscal Affairs Department.
The analysis in this report was coordinated in the Research Department under the general direction of
Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, Economic Counsellor and Director of Research. The project was directed by Petya
Koeva Brooks, Deputy Director, Research Department, and Daniel Leigh, Division Chief, Research Department.

FOREWORD

Resilient Global Economy Is Limping Along,
with Growing Divergences
The global economy continues to recover slowly
from the blows of the pandemic, Russia’s invasion of
Ukraine, and the cost-of-living crisis. In retrospect,
the resilience has been remarkable. Despite the disruption in energy and food markets caused by the war,
and the unprecedented tightening of global monetary conditions to combat decades-high inflation,
the global economy has slowed, but not stalled. Yet
growth remains slow and uneven, with growing global
divergences. The global economy is limping along, not
sprinting.
Global activity bottomed out at the end of last
year while inflation—both headline and underlying
(core)—is gradually being brought under control. But
a full recovery toward prepandemic trends appears
increasingly out of reach, especially in emerging market and developing economies.
According to our latest projections, global growth
will slow from 3.5 percent in 2022 to 3 percent this
year and 2.9 percent next year, a 0.1 percentage point
downgrade for 2024 from our July projections. This
remains well below the historical average.
Headline inflation continues to decelerate, from 9.2
percent in 2022, on a year-over-year basis, to 5.9 percent this year and 4.8 percent in 2024. Core inflation,
excluding food and energy prices, is also projected to
decline, albeit more gradually than headline inflation,
to 4.5 percent in 2024.
As a result, projections are increasingly consistent
with a “soft landing” scenario, bringing inflation down
without a major downturn in activity, especially in the
United States, where the forecast increase in unemployment is very modest, from 3.6 to 3.9 percent by 2025.
But important divergences are appearing. The
slowdown is more pronounced in advanced economies than in emerging market and developing ones.
Within advanced economies, the US surprised on the
upside, with resilient consumption and investment,
while euro area activity was revised downward. Many
emerging market economies proved quite resilient and
surprised on the upside, with the notable exception of

China, facing growing headwinds from its real estate
crisis and weakening confidence.
Three global forces are at play. First, the recovery
in services is almost complete. Over the past year,
strong demand for services supported service-oriented
economies—including important tourism destinations
such as France and Spain—relative to manufacturing powerhouses such as China and Germany. High
demand for labor-intensive services also translated into
tighter labor markets, and higher and more persistent
services inflation. But services activity is now weakening alongside a persistent manufacturing slowdown,
suggesting services inflation will decrease in 2024 and
labor markets and activity will soften.
Second, part of the slowdown is the result of the
tighter monetary policy necessary to bring inflation
down. This is starting to bite, but the transmission
is uneven across countries. Tighter credit conditions
are weighing on housing markets, investment, and
activity, more so in countries with a higher share of
adjustable-rate mortgages or where households are less
willing, or able, to dip into their savings. Firm bankruptcies have increased in the US and the euro area,
although from historically low levels. Countries are
also at different points in their hiking cycles: advanced
economies (except Japan) are near the peak, while
some emerging market economies, such as Brazil and
Chile, have already started easing.
Third, inflation and activity are shaped by the
incidence of last year’s commodity price shock.
Economies heavily dependent on Russian energy
imports experienced a steeper increase in energy prices
and a sharper slowdown. Some of our recent work
shows that the pass-through from higher energy prices
played a large role in driving core inflation upward in
the euro area, unlike in the United States, where core
inflation pressures reflect instead a tight labor market.
Despite signs of softening, labor markets in advanced
economies remain buoyant, with historically low unemployment rates helping to support activity. So far, there
is scant evidence of a “wage-price spiral,” and real wages
remain below prepandemic levels. Further, many countries experienced a sharp—and welcome—compression

in the wage distribution. Some of this compression
reflects the higher amenity value of flexible and remote
work schedules for high earners, reducing wage pressures for that group.
Risks
While some of the extreme risks—such as severe
banking instability—have moderated since April, the
balance remains tilted to the downside.
First, the real estate crisis could deepen further in
China, an important risk for the global economy. The
policy challenge is complex. Restoring confidence
requires promptly restructuring struggling property
developers, preserving financial stability, and addressing the strains in local public finance. If real estate
prices decline too rapidly, the balance sheets of banks
and households will worsen, with the potential for
serious financial amplification. If real estate prices
are artificially propped up, balance sheets will be
protected for a while, but this may crowd out other
investment opportunities, reduce new construction
activity, and have an adverse impact on local government revenues through reduced land sales. Either way,
China’s economy needs to pivot away from a creditdriven real estate model of growth.
Second, commodity prices could become more volatile under renewed geopolitical tensions and disruptions linked to climate change. Since June, oil prices
have increased by about 25 percent, on the back of
extended supply cuts from OPEC+ (the Organization
of the Petroleum Exporting Countries plus selected
nonmembers) countries. Food prices remain elevated
and could be disrupted further by an escalation of the
war in Ukraine, causing important hardship for many
low-income countries. This, of course, represents a
serious risk to the disinflation strategy. Geoeconomic
fragmentation has also led to a sharp increase in
the dispersion in commodity prices across regions,
including critical minerals. As Chapter 3 of this report
analyzes, this could pose serious macroeconomic risks
going forward, including to the climate transition.
Third, while both underlying and headline inflation have decreased, they remain uncomfortably
high. Near-term inflation expectations have risen
markedly above target, although they now appear
to be turning a corner. As Chapter 2 of this report
details, bringing these near-term inflation expectations back down is critical to winning the battle
against inflation. With tight labor markets, ample
xiv

excess savings in some countries, and adverse energy
price developments, inflation could become more
entrenched, requiring even more forceful action from
central banks.
Fourth, fiscal buffers have eroded in many countries, with elevated debt levels, rising funding costs,
slowing growth, and an increasing mismatch between
the growing demands on the state and available fiscal
resources (see the October 2023 Fiscal Monitor). This
leaves many countries more vulnerable to crises and
demands a renewed focus on managing fiscal risks.
Finally, despite the tightening of monetary policy,
financial conditions have eased in many countries (see
the October 2023 Global Financial Stability Report).
The danger is of a sharp repricing of risk, especially
for emerging markets, that would appreciate further
the US dollar, trigger capital outflows, and increase
borrowing costs and debt distress.
Policies
Under our baseline scenario, inflation continues
to recede as central banks maintain a tight stance.
With many countries near the peak of their tightening
cycles, little additional tightening is warranted. However, easing prematurely would squander the gains
achieved in the past 18 months. Once the disinflation
process is firmly on its way and near-term inflation
expectations are decreasing, adjusting the policy rate
downward will allow the monetary policy stance, that
is, the real interest rate, to remain unchanged until
inflation targets are in sight.
Fiscal policy needs to support the monetary strategy
and help the disinflation process. In 2022, fiscal and
monetary policies were pulling in the same direction,
as many of the pandemic emergency fiscal measures
were unwound. In 2023, the degree of alignment has
decreased. Most worrying is the case of the United
States, where the fiscal stance has deteriorated substantially. Fiscal policy in the US should not be procyclical, even less so at this stage of the inflation cycle.
More broadly, fiscal policy everywhere should focus on
rebuilding fiscal buffers that have been severely eroded
by the pandemic and the energy crisis, for instance, by
removing energy subsidies.
We should also return our focus to the medium
term. Here the picture is becoming darker. Mediumterm growth prospects are weak, especially for
emerging market and developing economies.
The implications are profound: a much slower

convergence toward the living standards of advanced
economies, reduced fiscal space, increased debt
vulnerabilities and exposure to shocks, and diminished opportunities to overcome the scarring from
the pandemic and the war.
With lower growth, higher interest rates, and
reduced fiscal space, structural reforms become key.
Higher long-term growth can be achieved through a
careful sequence of structural reforms, especially those
focused on governance, business regulations, and
the external sector. These “first-generation” reforms
help unlock growth and make subsequent reforms—
whether to credit markets, or for the green transition—much more effective.
Multilateral cooperation can help ensure that all
countries achieve better growth outcomes. First,
countries should avoid implementing policies that

contravene World Trade Organization rules and
distort international trade. Second, countries should
safeguard the flow of critical minerals needed for the
climate transition, as well as that of agricultural commodities. Such “green corridors” would help reduce
volatility and accelerate the green transition.
Finally, all countries should aim to limit geoeconomic fragmentation that prevents joint progress
toward common goals and instead work toward
restoring trust in rules-based multilateral frameworks
that enhance transparency and policy certainty and
help foster a shared global prosperity. A robust global
financial safety net with a well-resourced IMF at its
center is essential.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The global recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic
and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine remains slow and
uneven. Despite economic resilience earlier this year,
with a reopening rebound and progress in reducing inflation from last year’s peaks, it is too soon to
take comfort. Economic activity still falls short of its
prepandemic path, especially in emerging market and
developing economies, and there are widening divergences among regions. Several forces are holding back
the recovery. Some reflect the long-term consequences
of the pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and increasing
geoeconomic fragmentation. Others are more cyclical in
nature, including the effects of monetary policy tightening necessary to reduce inflation, withdrawal of fiscal
support amid high debt, and extreme weather events.
Global growth is forecast to slow from 3.5 percent in
2022 to 3.0 percent in 2023 and 2.9 percent in 2024.
The projections remain below the historical (2000–19)
average of 3.8 percent, and the forecast for 2024 is
down by 0.1 percentage point from the July 2023
Update to the World Economic Outlook. For advanced
economies, the expected slowdown is from 2.6 percent
in 2022 to 1.5 percent in 2023 and 1.4 percent in
2024, amid stronger-than-expected US momentum but
weaker-than-expected growth in the euro area. Emerging market and developing economies are projected to
have growth modestly decline, from 4.1 percent in 2022
to 4.0 percent in both 2023 and 2024, with a downward revision of 0.1 percentage point in 2024, reflecting
the property sector crisis in China. Forecasts for global
growth over the medium term, at 3.1 percent, are at
their lowest in decades, and prospects for countries to
catch up to higher living standards are weak. Global
inflation is forecast to decline steadily, from 8.7 percent
in 2022 to 6.9 percent in 2023 and 5.8 percent in
2024. But the forecasts for 2023 and 2024 are revised
up by 0.1 percentage point and 0.6 percentage point,
respectively, and inflation is not expected to return to
target until 2025 in most cases.

xvi

International Monetary Fund | October 2023

Risks to the outlook are more balanced than they
were six months ago, on account of the resolution of
US debt ceiling tensions and Swiss and US authorities’
having acted decisively to contain financial turbulence.
The likelihood of a hard landing has receded, but
the balance of risks to global growth remains tilted
to the downside. China’s property sector crisis could
deepen, with global spillovers, particularly for commodity exporters. Elsewhere, as Chapter 2 explains,
near-term inflation expectations have risen and could
contribute—along with tight labor markets––to core
inflation pressures persisting and requiring higher
policy rates than expected. More climate and geopolitical shocks could cause additional food and energy price
spikes. As Chapter 3 explains, intensifying geoeconomic
fragmentation could constrain the flow of commodities
across markets, causing additional price volatility and
complicating the green transition. Amid rising debtservice costs, more than half of low-income developing
countries are in or at high risk of debt distress.
There is little margin for error on the policy front.
Central banks need to restore price stability while
using policy tools to relieve potential financial stress
when needed. As Chapter 2 explains, effective monetary policy frameworks and communication are vital
for anchoring expectations and minimizing the output
costs of disinflation. Fiscal policymakers should
rebuild budgetary room for maneuver and withdraw
untargeted measures while protecting the vulnerable. Reforms to reduce structural impediments to
growth––by, among other things, encouraging labor
market participation—would smooth the decline of
inflation to target and facilitate debt reduction. Faster
and more efficient multilateral coordination is needed
on debt resolution to avoid debt distress. Cooperation is needed as well to mitigate the effects of climate
change and speed the green transition, including (as
Chapter 3 explains) by ensuring steady cross-border
flows of the necessary minerals.

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

Growing Global Divergences
More than three years after the global economy suffered the largest shock of the past 75 years, the wounds
are still healing, amid widening growth divergences
across regions. After a strong initial rebound from the
depths of the COVID-19 pandemic, the pace of recovery has moderated. Several forces are holding back the
recovery. Some reflect the long-term consequences of
the pandemic, Russia’s war in Ukraine, and increasing
geoeconomic fragmentation. Others are more cyclical,
including the effects of monetary policy tightening
necessary to reduce inflation, withdrawal of fiscal support amid high debt, and extreme weather events.
Despite signs of economic resilience earlier this year
and progress in reducing headline inflation, economic
activity is still generally falling short of prepandemic
(January 2020) projections, especially in emerging
­market and developing economies (Figure 1.1, panel 1).
The strongest recovery among major economies has
been in the United States, where GDP in 2023 is estimated to exceed its prepandemic path. The euro area
has recovered, though less strongly—with output still
2.2 percent below prepandemic projections, reflecting
greater exposure to the war in Ukraine and the associated adverse terms-of-trade shock, as well as a spike in
imported energy prices. In China, the pandemic-related
slowdown in 2022 and the property sector crisis contribute to the larger output losses of about 4.2 percent,
compared with prepandemic predictions. Other
emerging market and developing economies have seen
even weaker recoveries, especially low-income countries,
where output losses average more than 6.5 percent.
Higher interest rates and depreciated currencies have
exacerbated the difficulties of low-income countries,
placing more than half either at high risk of distress or
already in distress. Overall, global output for 2023 is
estimated at 3.4 percent (or about $3.6 trillion in 2023
prices) below prepandemic projections.
Private consumption has also recovered faster in
advanced economies than in emerging market and
developing economies, owing to an earlier reopening
in the former group facilitated by greater availability
of effective vaccines, stronger safety nets, more ample

policy stimulus, and greater feasibility of remote
work. These factors supported livelihoods during
the pandemic, and household consumption is now
broadly back to prepandemic trends. Among advanced
economies, private consumption has been stronger in the United States than in the euro area, with
households receiving larger fiscal transfers early in the
pandemic and spending the associated savings more
quickly; being better insulated from the rise in energy
prices resulting from the war in Ukraine; and feeling
relatively confident amid historically tight US labor
markets, which have supported real disposable incomes
(Figure 1.1, panel 2). Among emerging market and
developing economies, the consumption shortfall is
particularly large in China, reflecting tight restrictions
on mobility during the COVID-19 crisis.
Divergences in labor market performance across
regions broadly mirror those for output and consumption. Employment and labor participation rates are
estimated to exceed prepandemic trends in advanced
economies but to remain significantly below them in
emerging market and developing economies, reflecting more severe output losses and much weaker social
protection. Countries that had the most limited fiscal
space are also those where employment shortfalls are
the largest (ILO 2023). Among advanced economies,
the euro area has seen larger employment gains than
the United States. This may reflect more extensive use
in the former of worker-retention programs modeled
on the German Kurzarbeit short-time work scheme
(IMF 2020), which protect workers’ income and
allow businesses to retain firm-specific human capital,
reducing the costly process of separation, rehiring, and
training. In the euro area, these programs bolstered
employment during the most challenging phases of
the crisis and accelerated the recovery when economies
reopened (Figure 1.1, panel 3).
Investment, on the other hand, has uniformly fallen
short of prepandemic trends across regions. Businesses
have shown less enthusiasm for expansion and risk
taking amid rising interest rates, withdrawal of fiscal
support, dimmer prospects for product demand,
stricter lending conditions, and growing uncertainties

75 million to 95 million more people were living in
extreme poverty in 2022 compared with prepandemic
estimates. Spikes in food prices and related insecurities
following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as well as bouts
of extreme weather, have accentuated these difficulties.
The global average temperature in July 2023 was the
highest on record for any month, amid reports of catastrophic flooding, heat waves, and wildfires in many
regions. Overall, the global prevalence of undernourishment is significantly higher than before the pandemic (FAO and others 2023).

Resilient Start to 2023, Signs of Slowdown
Despite these persistent challenges, several headwinds to global growth subsided earlier this year. The
World Health Organization announced in May that
it no longer considered COVID-19 a global health
emergency, and infections and hospitalizations appear
to remain relatively limited, despite a recent uptick
in some regions. Supply chains, which the pandemic
disrupted, have largely normalized, with shipping costs
and suppliers’ delivery times back to prepandemic levels (Figure 1.2). And global financial conditions eased
after Swiss and US authorities took strong action in
March to contain turbulence in their banking sectors.
Amid these conditions, global GDP expanded by
3.4 percent in the second quarter of 2023 compared

with a year earlier––outperforming forecasts, including
those in the April 2023 WEO. The resilience reflected
strong consumption amid tight labor markets in the
United States and robust activity in economies with
large travel and tourism sectors, such as Italy, Mexico,
and Spain. These developments offset a slowdown in
more interest-rate-sensitive manufacturing sectors.
That said, there are signs the rebound is fading:
•• Diminishing pandemic-era savings: The stock of
savings built during the pandemic, which has so
far supported consumers, is declining in advanced
economies, especially the United States, as illustrated in Figure 1.3.1 This implies fewer resources
for households to draw on as they contend with a
still-elevated cost of living and more restricted credit
availability in the context of monetary tightening
aimed at reducing inflation.
•• Slowing catch-up in services, including travel: International tourist arrivals are approaching prepandemic
levels in most regions (Figure 1.4, panel 1). The
recovery of travel during 2021–23 has come with
especially strong economic growth in economies
with a large share of tourism activities in GDP
1Estimates of the stock of excess household savings—the cumulation of saving beyond the prepandemic trend—come with a range
of uncertainty and can differ across methodological approaches. For
the United States, they generally show a consistent pattern, with the
stock declining (see, for example, Abdelrahman and Oliveira 2023).

the combined effects of the postpandemic shift in
consumption back toward services, weaker demand
stemming from a higher cost of living, the unwinding of crisis policy support, tighter credit conditions,
and general uncertainty amid intensified geoeconomic fragmentation (Figure 1.5, panel 1).
Part of the slowdown is policy induced––the result
of the globally synchronous central bank tightening of monetary conditions to restore price stability.

International Monetary Fund | October 2023

Signs that tightening efforts are paying off are increasingly apparent, with global inflation steadily declining
from its multidecade peak in 2022 amid tighter credit
availability and cooling housing markets. Part of the
slowdown also reflects more idiosyncratic developments, such as the property sector crisis in China.

China: Slower Growth
China’s growth momentum is fading following a
COVID-19 reopening surge in early 2023. Growth
slowed from 8.9 percent in the first quarter of 2023
(seasonally adjusted annualized quarterly rate) to
4.0 percent in the second quarter. With ample economic slack and declining energy and food prices,
inflation fell to an estimated 0.2 percent (year over
year) in the second quarter of 2023.
High-frequency indicators suggest further weakness
with the property sector crisis in the country leading
the factors hampering growth. Country Garden—
China’s largest property developer and a major beneficiary of government support—is facing severe liquidity
stress, a sign that real estate distress is spreading to
stronger developers, despite policy easing measures.
Property developers face severe funding constraints,
preventing them from completing presold homes. This
is undermining home buyer confidence and prolonging
the property sector downturn. Meanwhile, real estate
investment and housing prices continue to decline,
putting pressure on local governments’ revenues
from land sales and threatening already fragile public
finances (­Figure 1.6, panel 1).
These developments, together with labor market
uncertainty—as reflected in elevated youth unemployment that reached more than 20 percent in June 2023
(Figure 1.6, panel 2)—have weighed on consumption.
Consumer confidence remains subdued despite the
economy’s reopening in the first quarter. Industrial
production, business investment, and exports are also
weakening, reflecting a combination of waning foreign
demand and geopolitical uncertainty. Commodity
exporters and countries that are part of the Asian
industrial supply chain are the most exposed to China’s
loss of momentum.

Inflation: Nearer, but Not Quite There
Global headline inflation has more than halved,
from its peak of 11.6 percent in the second quarter of
2022 (at a quarterly annualized rate) to 5.3 percent

in the second quarter of 2023. About four-fifths of
the gap between the 2022 peak and the prepandemic
(2017–19) annual average level of 3.5 percent has
closed. Among major economies, headline inflation in
the second quarter of 2023 ranged from –0.1 percent
in China (at a quarterly annualized rate) to 2.8 percent
in the euro area and 2.7 percent in the United States
(Figure 1.7). A narrowing in the cross-country variation in headline inflation has accompanied the decline.
As Figure 1.8 reports, the international distribution
of inflation rates widened during the 2022 inflation
surge, becoming skewed upward, but has since begun
to normalize.
A fall in energy prices and—to a lesser extent––in
food prices has driven the decline in headline inflation.

plus selected nonmember countries) were partly offset
by strong oil output growth in non-OPEC countries,
most notably the United States. Natural gas prices
also remain well below their 2022 peak, reflecting
ample storage and supplies from Norway and northern Africa. Food prices have declined modestly in
2023, with lower demand offset by supply reductions,
notably those resulting from Russia’s withdrawal from

energy prices is down from a peak of 8.5 percent in
the first quarter of 2022 (at a quarterly annualized
rate) to 4.9 percent in the second quarter of 2023,
nearly two-thirds of the way back to the prepandemic
(2017–19) annual average of 2.8 percent. Among
major economies, in the second quarter of 2023,
it ranged from 0.3 percent in China (at a quarterly
annualized rate) to 4.6 percent in the euro area
and 4.7 percent in the United States. Data for July
indicate a rise in inflation excluding food and energy
in most advanced economies; more data releases
are needed to assess progress in reducing underlying inflation.
The drivers of core inflation have reflected a combination of demand pressures, as shown in labor market
conditions and pass-through effects from past shocks
to headline inflation shocks, including those arising
from supply shifts in various industries. The roles of

6

International Monetary Fund | October 2023

these factors have differed markedly across economies.
Demand pressures in some advanced economies arose
from significant COVID-19–era fiscal payments to
households, as well as from ample monetary policy
stimulus early in the pandemic, which supported the
recovery in consumer spending. These policy-induced
pressures declined as policy support subsided.
Pass-through effects include the effects of past relative
price shocks—notably those to the price of energy—
on prices and costs in other industries through
supply chain inputs and wage demands. An important
pass-through channel is, as Chapter 2 explains, the
rise in near-term inflation expectations, which has
implications for both wage and price setting. IMF staff
analysis (Figure 1.9) suggests that in the euro area and
the United Kingdom, pass-through from past relative
price movements––in particular that from energy price
shocks associated with external factors––has recently
played a larger role than in the United States in driving
core inflation (the staff’s methodology was the same as
that used in Dao and others 2023).
In the United States, labor market tightness has
been an especially strong driver. Although labor
markets remain tight, especially in the United States,
the recent decline in the ratio of vacancies to the
number of unemployed people suggests some easing
(­Figure 1.10). Wage growth has remained contained,
with wage-price spirals—in which prices and wages
accelerate together for a sustained period—not generally taking hold in advanced economies (­Figure 1.11).
At the same time, evidence shows that wages at the
bottom of the distribution have risen faster than
the average, compressing the wage distribution.
Longer-term inflation expectations have remained well
anchored and contributed little to recent movements
in core inflation (Figure 1.9; Chapter 2).
Company profits have increased robustly over the
past two years, with wages having risen more slowly
than prices (Figure 1.12). For the United States and
the euro area, a decomposition of the GDP deflator
into labor costs and profits shows that in the early
phase of the pandemic (2020–21), profits accounted
for most of the rise in prices. But since 2022, labor
costs have contributed an increasing share to rising
prices—particularly in the United States. The rise
in profits (sales revenue minus all costs) does not
necessarily signal increased monopoly power, with
firms deliberately limiting supplies to raise prices in
excess of the cost of producing an additional unit of
output (marginal cost). Profits can rise when a surge

economies during 2019–22.3 Similarly, Colonna,
Torrini, and Viviano (2023) conclude that despite
profit share increases, firm markups were unchanged
or declined across several sectors in Germany and
Italy during 2022. Overall, these results suggest that
a rise in market power did not significantly contribute to the inflation surge of 2022. Moreover, there is
some evidence that since 2022, rising labor costs have
accounted for a significantly larger share of US price
increases than profits.
Even as central banks have taken decisive action,
inflation remains above target in almost all economies
with an inflation target. Among major central banks

IMF staff’s methodology is that illustrated in Box 1.2 of the
October 2022 World Economic Outlook. The “economic markup”
(a producer’s price over true marginal costs, inclusive of the shadow
cost of supply constraints) may be constant even while accounting
profits (total revenue minus costs) may show an increase. If supply
constraints remain, and nominal wages start to rise, prices could
then remain unchanged, with the true markup remaining constant
but accounting profits declining.

Tighter Monetary Policy, Tighter Credit
Acute stress in the banking sector has receded.
The March 2023 banking scare remained contained
and limited to problematic regional banks in the
United States and Credit Suisse––a Swiss globally
systemically important bank––on account of swift
reaction by authorities in both countries. However,
rapid rate hikes in major advanced economies over
the past 18 months, a necessary response to rapidly
rising inflationary pressures, have resulted in a tight
monetary policy stance—real rates above neutral
rates—that is expected to endure well into 2025
(Figure 1.13). And signs are that tighter monetary
policy has started to work its way through the financial system. Lending surveys in the United States and
Europe suggest that banks restricted access to credit

considerably over the past year and were expected
to continue to do so in coming months. And there
are also clear signs that tighter credit conditions are
increasingly affecting real activity. In advanced economies, credit and investment demand contracted in
the first half of the year, reflecting tighter supply as
well as lower demand for credit, as many businesses
began to deleverage in response to higher interest
rates and production overcapacity (Figure 1.14).
Higher interest rates are likely to put banks under
increasing pressure in major economies, both directly
(through higher cost of funding) and indirectly (as
credit quality deteriorates). Housing markets have
already been reacting, with house prices slowing or
reversing since the beginning of the tightening cycle
in several countries (Figure 1.15), and bankruptcy
rates have increased in some economies (increasing by
20 percent in the United States over the last year) as
pandemic-time forbearance measures are phased out.
Bankruptcies remain lower than before the pandemic
in most countries but are rising rapidly.
Debt markets have started to reflect tighter monetary policy, whereas spreads to risk-free government
debt have stayed more or less constant. This ­suggests
that although credit conditions have tightened
significantly, there is no immediate indication of a
credit crunch.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Navigating Global Divergences

The latest projections confirm that the global
economy is slowing as inflation declines from last
year’s multidecade peak. A contraction in global per
capita real GDP—which often happens in a global
recession—is not part of the baseline scenario. Growth
and employment in the first half of the year remained
more resilient than forecast in the April 2023 WEO.
Although there is little change in the forecast for the
global average since the July 2023 WEO Update,
several shifts in growth and inflation prospects are
observed across countries. In addition, medium-term
prospects for economic growth remain the lowest in
decades, with middle- and lower-income countries
facing a slower pace of convergence toward higher
­living standards.
The baseline forecasts for the global economy are
predicated on a number of assumptions (Figure 1.16),
notably for fuel and nonfuel commodity prices, as well
as the stances of monetary and fiscal policy:
•• Commodity price assumptions: Prices of fuel commodities are projected to fall on average by 36 percent and oil prices by about 17 percent, with the
decreases reflecting mainly the slowdown in global
economic activity, and natural gas and coal prices
to decline from their 2022 peaks by 61 percent
and 51 percent, respectively. The forecast for nonfuel commodity prices is a decline of 6.3 percent,
on average, in 2023, with prices for base metals
expected to decrease by 4.7 percent, the decreases
reflecting concerns regarding real estate investment
in China. Food commodity prices, after rising by
14.8 percent in 2022, are predicted to decline by
6.8 percent in 2023, with prices remaining well
above their 2021 levels. Compared with forecasts
in the July 2023 WEO Update, an upward revision
to wheat prices following the suspension of the
Black Sea Grain Initiative (which occurred after
the July 2023 WEO Update forecasting round) is
broadly offset by downward revisions to other food
commodity prices.
•• Monetary policy assumptions: Global interest
rate assumptions are on average revised upward
­compared with those in the April 2023 WEO,
reflecting actual and signaled policy tightening
by major central banks. The Federal Reserve’s
policy rate is expected to peak at its current level
of about 5.4 percent, the Bank of England to
raise its to peak at about 6.0 percent, and the

3.9 percent in 2023, before all three reduce rates

term has contributed to the rise in long-term
policy rate assumptions. For Japan, policy rates
for the medium term (2026–28) are revised

30

CHAPTER 1

upward, reflecting changes to the country’s
yield-curve-control framework, and long-term
rates are revised upward accordingly. As near-term
inflation expectations decline, real interest rates are
likely to stay elevated even after nominal rates start
to fall. In addition, changes in monetary policy
are becoming less synchronous, with some central
banks that tightened policy earlier (such as the
Central Bank of Brazil) initiating their easing cycle.
•• Fiscal policy assumptions: Governments in advanced
economies are on average expected to ease fiscal
policy in 2023, following a rise in fiscal balances in
2022, whereas in emerging market and developing
economies, the projected fiscal stance is on average
neutral. Fiscal consolidation is expected in 2024 in
both groups of economies. Fiscal tightening is on
average expected to be greater in economies that
recently experienced a sharper rise in government
debt (Figure 1.16, panel 3). A rise in government
debt amounting to 10 percentage points of GDP
during 2019–22 is associated on average with
fiscal consolidation (rise in the structural primary
balance) of 0.8 percentage point of GDP during
2022–24. Exceptions to this pattern include, for
example, Argentina, where despite a decline, debt
levels remain high, and the fiscal stance is expected
to continue tightening to secure fiscal and debt
sustainability.

Growth Outlook: Offsetting Divergences
Global growth is projected to fall from 3.5 percent
in 2022 to 3.0 percent in 2023 and 2.9 percent in
2024 on an annual average basis (Table 1.1). There
is a downward revision of 0.1 percentage point for
2024 compared with the July 2023 WEO Update
projection. At the same time, there are more sizable
changes in the underlying growth trajectories of major
economies, with stronger projections for the United
States and downward revisions for China and the euro
area. The forecasts for growth during 2023–24 are
also slower than those before the onset of the shocks
of 2020–22 (Figure 1.17): the January 2022 WEO
Update projected global growth at 3.8 percent in 2023
and 3.4 percent in 2024. The 2023–24 forecasts are
also below the historical (2000–19) annual average of
3.8 percent. Growth is below the historical average
across broad income groups, both in overall GDP as
well as in per capita GDP. On a year-over-year basis,

global growth bottomed out in the fourth quarter
of 2022. However, in some major economies, it is
not expected to have bottomed out until the second
half of 2023.
Advanced economies continue to drive the decline
in annual average growth from 2022 to 2023, with
stronger services activity offset by weaker manufacturing, as well as idiosyncratic factors. On average, these
economies are expected to have broadly stable growth
in 2024 with a pickup in 2025. By contrast, emerging
market and developing economies, on average, are
projected to see stable growth over 2022–24, with
a slight pickup in 2025, although with sizable shifts
across regions.

Growth Forecast for Advanced Economies
For advanced economies, the growth slowdown
projected is significant—from 2.6 percent in 2022 to
1.5 percent in 2023 and 1.4 percent in 2024—with
no overall revision from the July 2023 WEO Update,
amid stronger-than-expected US momentum and
weaker-than-expected growth in the euro area. About
90 percent of advanced economies are projected to
see lower growth in 2023. With the projected slowdown in advanced economies, annual unemployment
is projected to rise by an average of 0.1 percentage
point over 2022–24, although with more pronounced

increases in Canada (1.0 percentage point), the
United Kingdom (0.9 percentage point), and the
United States (0.2 percentage point). Nevertheless, the forecast for unemployment in 2024 is on
average 0.4 percentage point lower than that in the
April 2023 WEO, reflecting still-tight labor markets
in a number of cases.
•• In the United States, growth is projected at 2.1 percent in 2023 and 1.5 percent in 2024. The forecast
is revised upward by 0.3 percentage point for 2023
and by 0.5 percentage point for 2024, compared
with July 2023 WEO Update projections, owing to
stronger business investment in the second quarter
and resilient consumption growth, a reflection of
a still-tight labor market. In addition, as already
mentioned, the general government fiscal stance
is expected to be expansionary in 2023. However,
with wage growth slowing, savings accumulated
during the pandemic running out, and the Federal
Reserve maintaining tight monetary policy, growth
is expected to slow in the second half of 2023 and
in 2024. The unemployment rate is forecast to rise
from 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2023 to a
peak of 4.0 percent by the last quarter of 2024––a
lower peak than previously projected (5.2 percent in
the April 2023 WEO and 5.6 percent at the time of
the October 2022 WEO), consistent with a softer
landing than ­earlier expected for the US economy.
•• Growth in the euro area is projected to fall from
3.3 percent in 2022 to 0.7 percent in 2023, before
14

International Monetary Fund | October 2023

rising to 1.2 percent in 2024. The forecast is revised
downward by 0.2 percentage point and 0.3 percentage point for 2023 and 2024, respectively,
compared with July 2023 WEO Update projections.
There is also a divergence in growth across major
euro area economies in 2023. For Germany, where
a slight economic contraction is now projected in
the second half of 2023, amid weakness in interest-rate-sensitive sectors and slower trading-partner
demand, there is a downward revision of 0.2 percentage point to growth of –0.5 percent. For France,
where there was catch-up in industrial production
and external demand outperformed in the first half
of 2023, there is an upward 0.2 percentage point
revision to growth of 1.0 percent.
•• Among other major advanced economies, there
is also some divergence in growth. Growth in
the United Kingdom is projected to decline from
4.1 percent in 2022 to 0.5 percent in 2023, with
a 0.1 percentage point upward revision. The
decline in growth reflects tighter monetary policies
to curb still-high inflation and lingering impacts
of the terms-of-trade shock from high energy
prices. In Japan, growth is projected to rise from
1.0 percent in 2022 to 2.0 percent in 2023, with
a 0.6 percentage point upward revision, buoyed by
pent-up demand, a surge in inbound tourism, and
accommodative policies, as well as by a rebound
in auto exports that had earlier been held back by
supply chain issues.

CHAPTER 1

Growth Forecast for Emerging Market and
Developing Economies
For emerging market and developing economies,
growth is projected to decline relatively modestly, from
4.1 percent in 2022 to 4.0 percent in both 2023 and
2024, with a downward revision of 0.1 percentage
point for 2024 compared with the July 2023 WEO
Update projection. However, this average path hides
regional divergences, with growth in two of the five
main geographic regions rising in 2023 and then
falling in 2024.
•• Growth in emerging and developing Asia is projected
to rise from 4.5 percent in 2022 to 5.2 percent in
2023, then to decline to 4.8 percent in 2024, with
downward revisions of 0.1 percentage point and
0.2 percentage point for 2023 and 2024, respectively,
compared with July projections. The revision reflects
a lower forecast for China, which is revised downward
by 0.2 percentage point for 2023 and by 0.3 percentage point for 2024 to growth of 5.0 percent in 2023
and 4.2 percent in 2024. With the property market
crisis in that country, lower investment is the main
contributor to the revision. Growth in India is projected to remain strong, at 6.3 percent in both 2023
and 2024, with an upward revision of 0.2 percentage
point for 2023, reflecting stronger-than-expected
consumption during April-June.
•• Growth in emerging and developing Europe is
projected to rise to 2.4 percent in 2023, with an
upward revision of 0.6 percentage point since
July, before declining to 2.2 percent in 2024. The
forecast for Russia is for a rise from –2.1 percent
in 2022 to 2.2 percent in 2023, with an upward
revision of 0.7 percentage point for 2023. The
rise in growth reflects a substantial fiscal stimulus,
strong investment, and resilient consumption in
the context of a tight labor market. The upward
revision for the region for 2023 also reflects an
increase of 5.0 percentage points to the forecast
for Ukraine to growth of 2.0 percent; the increase
is due to stronger-than-expected domestic demand
growth, with firms and households adapting to the
war in that country amid sharply declining inflation
and stable foreign exchange markets. It additionally
reflects a 1.0 percentage point upside revision to
growth of 4.0 percent in Türkiye, on the back of
stronger-than-expected domestic demand.
•• Latin America and the Caribbean is expected to
see growth decline from 4.1 percent in 2022 to
2.3 percent in both 2023 and 2024, although with

Global Prospects and Policies

0.4 percentage point and 0.1 percentage point upward
revisions for 2023 and 2024, respectively, since July.
The decline for 2023 reflects a normalization of
growth along with the effect of tighter policies, a
weaker external environment, and lower commodity
prices. The upward revision to 2023 since July reflects
stronger-than-expected growth in Brazil, revised
upward by 1.0 percentage point to 3.1 percent, driven
by buoyant agriculture and resilient services in the
first half of 2023. Consumption has also remained
strong, supported by fiscal stimulus. The upward revision for the region also reflects stronger-than-expected
growth in Mexico, revised upward by 0.6 percentage
point to 3.2 percent, with the delayed postpandemic
recovery taking hold in construction and services and
spillovers from resilient US demand.
•• Growth in the Middle East and Central Asia is
projected to decline from 5.6 percent in 2022 to
2.0 percent in 2023, before picking up to 3.4 percent in 2024, with a 0.5 percentage point downward
revision for 2023 and a 0.2 percentage point upward
revision for 2024. The change for 2023 is attributable mainly to a steeper-than-expected growth slowdown in Saudi Arabia, from 8.7 percent in 2022 to
0.8 percent in 2023, with a negative revision to the
latter of 1.1 percentage point. The downgrade for
growth in Saudi Arabia in 2023 reflects announced
production cuts, including unilateral cuts and
those in line with an agreement through OPEC+.
Private investment, including that from “gigaproject” implementation, continues to support non-oil
GDP growth, which remains strong and unchanged
from previous projections. The downgrade for 2023
also reflects cuts to the growth forecast for Sudan
to about –18.3 percent (a downward revision of
nearly 20 percentage points) reflecting the outbreak
of conflict, deteriorating domestic security, and the
worsening humanitarian situation. The upgrade
for 2024 reflects the unwinding of some of the
announced production cuts.
•• In sub-Saharan Africa, growth is projected to decline
to 3.3 percent in 2023 before picking up to 4.0
percent in 2024, with 0.2 percentage point and
0.1 percentage point downward revisions for 2023
and 2024, respectively, and with growth remaining
below the historical average of 4.8 percent. The
projected decline reflects, in a number of cases,
worsening weather shocks, the global slowdown,
and domestic supply issues, including, notably, in
the electricity sector. Growth in Nigeria is projected
International Monetary Fund | October 2023

15

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Navigating Global Divergences

to decline from 3.3 percent in 2022 to 2.9 percent
in 2023 and 3.1 percent in 2024, with negative
effects of high inflation on consumption taking
hold. The forecast for 2023 is revised downward
by 0.3 percentage point, reflecting weaker oil and
gas production than expected, partially as a result
of maintenance work. In South Africa, growth is
expected to decline from 1.9 percent in 2022 to
0.9 percent in 2023, with the decline reflecting
power shortages, although with a 0.6 percentage
point upward revision thanks to the intensity of
power shortages in the second quarter of 2023 being
lower than expected.

Inflation Outlook: Gradual Decline to Target
Global headline inflation is expected to steadily
decline from its peak of 8.7 percent in 2022
(annual average) to 6.9 percent in 2023 and
5.8 percent in 2024 (Table 1.1). The forecast for
2024 is revised upward by 0.6 percentage point,
reflecting higher-than-expected core inflation. On a
year-over-year basis, projected global headline inflation
peaked at 9.5 percent in the third quarter of 2022 and
is projected to reach 5.9 percent by the fourth quarter
of 2023 before falling to 4.8 percent in the fourth
quarter of 2024, still above the prepandemic (2017–19)
annual average of about 3.5 percent. Although monetary tightening is starting to bear fruit, a central driver
of the fall in headline inflation projected for 2023 is
declining international commodity prices.
Nearly three-quarters of economies are expected
to see lower headline inflation in 2023, but the pace
of disinflation is especially pronounced for advanced
economies (Figure 1.18). These economies are expected
to see (annual average) inflation fall by 2.7 percentage points in 2023, about double the (1.3 percentage
point) decline projected for emerging market and developing economies. Part of this difference reflects advanced
economies’ benefiting from stronger monetary policy
frameworks and communications, which facilitate
disinflation (Chapter 2), but the difference also reflects
lower exposure to shocks to commodity prices and
exchange rates. In low-income developing countries,
inflation is on average projected to be in double digits
and is not expected to fall until 2024.
There are also large differences in the expected pace
of change in headline inflation across major economies,
as Figure 1.19 reports, reflecting different starting
points. The euro area is expected to see an especially

sharp fall in (year-over-year) inflation in 2023––of
6.6 percentage points––from 9.9 percent in the fourth
quarter of 2022 to 3.3 percent in the fourth quarter
of 2023, with the fall reflecting in part the decrease
in energy prices. In the United States, where inflation
peaked earlier, the forecast is for a fall of 3.9 percentage points, from 7.1 percent in the fourth quarter of
2022 to 3.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2023.
In China, where inflation declined to near zero in the
second quarter of 2023, a gradual rise––to still-low
levels––is projected for the second half of 2023 as the
drag from lower commodity prices wanes.
Core inflation is generally projected to decline more
gradually than headline. Globally, it is set to decline
modestly, from 6.4 percent in 2022 (annual average)

with the July 2023 WEO Update projections. The
drivers of the upside revisions differ by economy but
reflect, in several cases, still tight labor markets and
stickier-than-expected services inflation, as well as, in
some cases, including Türkiye, which accounts for the
bulk of the global upside revision for 2024, the effects of
past currency depreciations and the related pass-through
into underlying inflation. On an annual average basis,

over half of economies are expected to see no decline in
core inflation in 2023. On a fourth-quarter-over-fourthquarter basis, however, about 86 percent of economies
(for which quarterly data are available) are projected to
see a decline. Overall, returning inflation to target is
expected to take until at least 2025 in most cases. Comparison of official inflation targets with the latest forecasts
for 72 inflation-targeting economies (34 advanced
economies and 38 major emerging market and developing economies) suggests that annual average inflation
will exceed targets (or the midpoints of target ranges) in
93 percent of these economies in 2023 (­Figure 1.20).
Countries where inflation in 2023 is expected to average
below target include China, Thailand, and Vietnam. In
China, this projection reflects subdued core inflation in
the context of substantial economic slack, with rising
youth unemployment and pass-through from lower
energy costs. In Thailand, this prospective outcome
reflects strong pass-through from lower energy prices to
core inflation as well as lower house price inflation. In
Vietnam, it reflects a slowdown in economic activity and
pass-through from lower energy prices. In 2024, inflation
is still expected to exceed targets (or the midpoints of target ranges) in 89 percent of economies, with an expected
median deviation of about 1 percentage point. By 2025,
inflation is expected to be within only 0.2 percentage
point of target (or the midpoints of target ranges) in
most economies.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Navigating Global Divergences

A Mediocre Medium Term
Forecasts for the growth rate of global GDP over the
medium term are at their lowest in decades. As Box 1.1
explains, five-year-ahead forecasts for this rate from both
the WEO and Consensus Economics—which summarizes the medium-term projections of leading forecasters
for more than 100 economies—have declined over the
past few decades. The latest WEO forecast for global
growth in 2028 is 3.1 percent, as compared with a
medium-term growth projection of 3.6 percent just
before the onset of the pandemic (at the time of the
January 2020 WEO Update) and 4.9 percent just before
the onset of the global financial crisis (at the time of the
April 2008 WEO). More than 80 percent of economies
have seen a slowdown in their growth prospects from
15 years ago, at the time of the April 2008 WEO.
Three-quarters of this reduction in global growth comes
from weaker prospects for per capita GDP growth
rather than merely slower population growth. A decomposition of the drivers of weaker per capita growth prospects points to slower prospective capital accumulation
per worker and slower total factor productivity growth
as the largest contributors. The slowdown in labor force
participation in advanced economies also contributed
about a third of the overall decline in projected per
capita GDP growth, in the context of changing demographic trends because of population aging.
Prospects for income convergence across economies
have also dimmed. At the time of the April 2008
WEO, poorer countries in terms of per capita income
were expected to grow significantly faster than richer
ones. But this growth differential has declined over the
subsequent 15 years. As a result, the expected number
of years needed for poorer countries to close half the
gap in income per capita with richer countries has
increased significantly since 15 years ago. Dimming
global growth prospects imply fewer resources available
to navigate a shock-prone world and attract needed
investments.
Overall, based on current policies, a full recovery
of global output to its prepandemic path is unlikely.
Figure 1.21 reports the latest medium-term forecast for
global GDP in trillions of dollars at 2023 prices. Even
before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the inflation
surge of 2022, there was little prospect of returning
to the prepandemic path (as reflected in the January
2020 forecasts), with expectations of longer-term
scarring, particularly for emerging market and developing economies. Recovery to the prepandemic trend is
now even more elusive. The latest projections for 2028

respectively). WEO = World Economic Outlook.

imply a global output loss of some 5.0 percent, with
respect to prepandemic projections, or $6.4 trillion at
2023 prices.

Trade Growth Historically Low
World trade growth is expected to decline from
5.1 percent in 2022 to 0.9 percent in 2023, before
rising to 3.5 percent in 2024, well below the 2000–19
average of 4.9 percent. The projected decline in 2023
reflects not only the path of global demand, but also
shifts in its composition toward domestic services;
lagged effects of dollar appreciation, which slows trade
owing to the widespread invoicing of products in
dollars; and rising trade barriers. In 2022, countries
imposed almost 3,000 new restrictions on trade, up
from fewer than 1,000 in 2019.
Meanwhile, global current account balances––the
sums of absolute surpluses and deficits––are expected
to narrow in 2023, following their significant increase
in 2022 (Figure 1.22). As reported in the IMF’s 2023
External Sector Report, the rise in current account
balances in 2022 reflected largely commodity price
increases triggered by the war in Ukraine, which
caused a widening in oil and other commodity trade
balances. Over the medium term, global balances are
expected to narrow gradually as commodity prices
decline. Creditor and debtor stock positions reached
historically elevated levels in 2022, with the increases

reflecting mainly widening current account balances.
They are expected to moderate slightly over the
medium term as current account balances gradually
narrow. In some economies, gross external liabilities
remain large from a historical perspective and pose
risks of external stress.

Risks to the Outlook: Tilted to the Downside
but More Balanced
Adverse risks have receded since the April 2023
WEO, implying a more balanced distribution of risks
around the outlook for global growth. Economic
activity has proved more resilient than expected, and
inflation is on a downward path, surprising on the
downside in a number of cases. In addition, earlier this

Sep.
23

year, the resolution of US debt ceiling tensions and
swift action by Swiss and US authorities to contain
banking sector turbulence reduced the immediate
risks of broader financial stress. Nevertheless, concerns
regarding global inflation and recession remain high
(Figure 1.23), reflecting the still-challenging environment, and the balance of risks to global growth
remains tilted to the downside.
The most prominent risks and uncertainties
surrounding the outlook are now discussed; a
model-based analysis that quantifies risks to the global
outlook and plausible scenarios follows in Box 1.2.

Upside Risks
More favorable outcomes for global growth than
in the baseline forecast, which would strengthen the
likelihood of a soft landing, are increasingly plausible:
•• Underlying inflation falls faster than expected. Factors
that could contribute to such an outcome include
stronger-than-expected pass-through from lower
energy prices or a compression of profit margins to
absorb cost increases. Declining job vacancies could
also play a stronger-than-expected role in easing
labor markets, implying a downward shift in the
ratio of vacancies to unemployment and reducing
the need for further monetary tightening to curb
inflation. As Box 1.2 explains, such developments
would support economic growth by restoring
purchasing power for households and allowing
International Monetary Fund | October 2023

19

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Navigating Global Divergences

central banks to bring forward an easing in their
policy stances.
•• Domestic demand recovers faster. In numerous economies, the stock of excess savings accumulated during
the pandemic has not yet been drained and consumption remains below prepandemic trends, raising
the possibility of a faster-than-expected consumption
recovery. The US labor market could again prove
tighter than expected, supporting a more resilient
consumption path. Stronger policy support in China
than currently envisaged––through means-tested
transfers to households in particular––could bolster
the recovery and generate positive global spillovers.
Furthermore, as Box 1.2 explains, private investment
could recover more strongly to prepandemic levels
than currently expected in response to current policy
initiatives. Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and progress in green technologies could also
usher in a new period of strong productivity growth,
boosting investment and growth.

Downside Risks
Despite the recent favorable growth ­surprises,
numerous adverse risks to global growth
remain plausible:
•• China’s economic growth slows further. Recent
developments shift the distribution of China’s
growth forecast risks to the downside, with negative
implications for trading partners. The extent of
the slowdown will depend largely on the Chinese
government’s policy response. To be effective, that
response will have to preserve financial stability by
expediting the restructuring of struggling property
developers, facilitating the completion of housing
projects, and addressing the growing strain in local
government finances, all of which would help restore
business and consumer confidence. Policy space has
shrunk but is not fully exhausted. Given the lack of
inflationary pressure, the People’s Bank of China has
some room to ease. At the same time, fiscal expenditures can be reoriented toward spending, with higher
fiscal multipliers, keeping the overall fiscal stance
broadly neutral. For instance, targeted support to
households can be provided while shifting away
from increasingly ineffective and expensive investment in infrastructure. In the most fiscally fragile
provinces, financial stress in the real estate sector
could end up spilling over to the rest of the financial
sector via the sovereign-banking-corporate nexus

20

International Monetary Fund | October 2023

and contagion through nonbank financial intermediaries (see Chapter 1 of the October 2023 Global
Financial Stability Report). Should concerns about
financial stability in China fester, the impact could
be felt in other emerging market economies through
exchange rate volatility and destabilizing capital
flows. Box 1.2 provides a quantification of the principal risks stemming from a deeper-than-expected
contraction in the real estate sector in the absence of
swift action to restructure property developers and
unintended fiscal tightening in response to lower tax
revenues for local governments.
•• Commodity prices become more volatile amid climate and geopolitical shocks. Intense heat waves and
droughts in the midst of record global temperatures
this year have provided a taste of a more inhospitable
future blighted by global climate change. More frequent crop failures across countries are likely, causing
food price spikes and food insecurity. The ongoing
El Niño phenomenon, which in the past typically
has raised global food prices by more than 6 percent
in a year (European Central Bank calculations as
cited in Schnabel 2023), poses further risks. The
war in Ukraine and geopolitical tensions elsewhere
could intensify, triggering supply chain disruptions
and renewed fluctuations in food, fuel, fertilizer, and
other commodity prices. The suspension in July of
the Black Sea Grain Initiative and recent attacks on
Ukraine’s grain facilities are concerns in this regard.
In this context, a proliferation of export restrictions
on agricultural products aimed at reducing domestic prices complicates the delivery of commodities
to global markets, with the potential to exacerbate
fluctuations in commodity prices. A rise in oil prices
driven by a reduction in oil supply could reduce
global economic activity and raise inflation, with the
magnitude of the effects differing across regions.4
Moreover, as Chapter 3 explains, intensifying geoeconomic fragmentation could constrain the flow of
commodities across regions, causing additional price
volatility. Commodities are particularly vulnerable to
trade restrictions, as their production is highly concentrated as a result of natural endowments. Finally,
shortages of energy resulting from lower investment
in fossil fuel development that are not matched by
4As reported in Box 1.3 of the October 2022 WEO, a 30 percent
rise in oil prices relative to baseline could reduce the level of global
GDP by about 0.5 percent and raise global inflation by about
1.2 percentage points, relative to baseline. The analysis assumes
monetary policy responds endogenously to movements in inflation.

CHAPTER 1

corresponding increases in alternative clean energy
supplies may cause more frequent energy crises. Such
adverse supply shocks may affect countries asymmetrically, with particularly acute effects on lower-income
countries, where food and energy constitute a large
share of household consumption. Serious effects are
especially likely in sub-Saharan Africa, where food
averages about 40 percent of consumption.
•• Underlying inflation persists. Tight labor markets and
wage demands to compensate for past cost-of-living
increases could contribute to persistent underlying
inflationary pressures. In countries where companies’
profit margins have grown in the past two years,
there may be room to accommodate a rebound in
real wages without triggering further price increases.
With economic activity slowing, market pressures
could contain the pass-through from labor costs to
prices. However, as Chapter 2 explains, near-term
inflation expectations remain elevated and above
target inflation rates, which may contribute to more
persistent wage and price pressures. This would complicate the task of monetary policy in restoring price
stability. The ample stock of excess household savings
in some economies could, where the surpluses are
still sizable, slow the effects of monetary policy tightening on inflation. Greater-than-expected pressures
on underlying inflation could then force central
banks to—again—raise rates by more than expected.
•• Financial markets reprice. Financial markets have
adjusted upward their expectations in regard to monetary policy tightening in recent months, but new
upside inflation surprises would force a monetary
policy reassessment and could trigger a sudden rise in
interest rate expectations and falling asset prices—as
happened in March. Movements such as these could
further tighten financial conditions and stress banks
and nonbank financial institutions whose balance
sheets remain vulnerable to interest rate risk, especially those highly exposed to commercial real estate.
Contagion effects are possible. A flight to safety
(Box 1.2), with an attendant appreciation of reserve
currencies, would trigger negative ripple effects for
global trade and growth and raise inflation in emerging market and developing economies, especially
those highly dependent on imports of food and fuel.
•• Debt distress increases. Global financial conditions,
which measure the cost of funding in capital markets,
have generally eased since the March 2023 banking
stress episode, but lending standards have tightened
and loan demand has declined in the United States,

the euro area, and some emerging market economies
(see Chapter 1 of the October 2023 Global Financial Stability Report). Moreover, borrowing costs for
emerging market and developing economies remain
high, constraining priority spending and raising the
risk of debt distress. The share of emerging market
and ­developing economies with sovereign credit
spreads above 1,000 basis points was 24 percent as of
August: still much higher than two years ago (only
9.3 percent). For sub-Saharan Africa, spreads still
exceed 680 basis points in more than half of cases
(Figure 1.24). The share of low-income countries
(56 percent) and emerging markets (25 percent)
in or at high risk of debt distress this year remains
elevated, as it was last year.
•• Geoeconomic fragmentation intensifies, hampering
multilateral cooperation. The ongoing separation of
the world economy into blocs amid Russia’s war
in Ukraine and other geopolitical tensions could
intensify—with more restrictions on trade (in
particular, trade in strategic goods, such as critical
minerals); cross-border movements of capital, technology, and workers; and international payments.
Should this happen, the costs for global prosperity
will be high. Over the long term, trade fragmentation alone—that is, the splintering of countries into

blocs that trade exclusively with one another—could
reduce annual global GDP by up to 7 percent (Aiyar
and others 2023). Intensification of geoeconomic
fragmentation would also hamper multilateral
cooperation in providing crucial public goods, such
as fighting climate change and future pandemics and
ensuring energy and food security.
•• Social unrest resumes. Reports of social unrest—
including protests, riots, and major demonstrations—
have declined internationally since reaching elevated
levels in late 2019 (Figure 1.25, which updates
the index of Barrett and others 2022). However, a
resumption of social turmoil, potentially as a result of
future food and fuel price spikes, could hurt economic activity, particularly in countries with more
limited scope to cushion the impact through policies
(Hadzi-Vaskov, Pienknagura, and Ricci 2021).
Social unrest could also complicate the passage and
implementation of necessary reforms, including those
relating to the energy transition.

Globally Consistent Risk Assessment of the World
Economic Outlook Forecast
The risk of a hard landing has clearly receded since
April, as the quantitative analysis in Box 1.2, based on
the IMF’s Group of Twenty (G20) Model, ­illustrates.

22

International Monetary Fund | October 2023

The estimated probability that global growth in 2023
will fall below 2.0 percent—an outcome that has
occurred only five times since 1970––is now about
5 percent, down from an estimated 25 percent at the
time of the April 2023 WEO. For 2024, the probability
of such an outcome is about 15 percent, also down from
about 25 percent at the time of the April 2023 WEO.
A contraction in global per capita real GDP—which
often happens when there is a global recession—in 2024
has an estimated probability below 10 percent. At the
same time, the probability of global growth’s exceeding
3.8 percent (the historical average during 2000–19) is
also less than 20 percent for 2024, highlighting the relatively slow outlook for global growth. Turning to prices,
the probability that core inflation in 2024 will be higher
than in 2023, instead of declining to 5.3 percent from
6.3 percent in 2023, is assessed at about 15 percent.

Policy Priorities: From Disinflation to
Sustained Growth
With inflation declining, policymakers are approaching the final stage of the inflation cycle that started
in 2021. But despite the progress, persistent policy
challenges remain. Underlying inflation is still too high
in most countries and could easily persist, and budgetary space for needed investments is constrained in
many cases, particularly in lower- and middle-income
countries saddled with unsustainable debts. Putting a
priority on supply-enhancing reforms that front-load
gains and foster buy-in would narrow the large output
losses projected under current policies, especially for
emerging market and developing economies. Mitigating the negative effects of climate change and
geoeconomic fragmentation and protecting the most
vulnerable will require swift and internationally coordinated policy actions.

Policies with Near-Term Impact
Durably restoring price stability: With global core
inflation still high and declining slowly, central banks
should generally maintain a tight stance and avoid
prematurely easing monetary policy. At the same time,
there are fewer cases in which sizable interest rate hikes
are warranted, with increasing differentiation across
countries’ policy needs for ensuring price stability.
•• Returning inflation to target: In economies in which
inflation is still elevated and persistent, a restrictive
stance—with real rates above neutral—is needed until

CHAPTER 1

clear signs emerge that underlying inflation is durably
cooling. This is critical to safeguarding the success of
many central banks in keeping longer-term inflation
expectations anchored. As Chapter 2 explains, strong
monetary policy frameworks and effective communication are vital for minimizing the output costs
of disinflation. Once underlying inflation is clearly
cooling, with inflation and inflation expectations
approaching the target, moving rates gradually to a
more neutral policy stance may be warranted, while
signaling continued commitment to price stability.
For countries with inflation already below target,
easing policies may be necessary to reduce the risks of
inflation expectations de-anchoring.
•• Navigating uncertainty along the disinflation path:
The task for central banks is complicated by the
difficulty of estimating with confidence levels of
neutral rates of interest and of unemployment, as
well as by lags in policy transmission (see Box 1.2
of the April 2023 WEO), uncertainties associated
with forecasting inflation in this environment, and
the differing potency of the transmission mechanism across economic sectors. Calibrating monetary
policy will require weighing the costs of lowering
nominal rates prematurely versus those of delaying too much.
•• Coordinating monetary and fiscal policies: Although
the primary responsibility for restoring price stability lies with central banks, legislated government
spending cuts or tax increases aimed at ensuring
public debt sustainability can, by reducing aggregate
demand and reinforcing the overall credibility of
disinflation strategies, further ease inflation. This
is especially the case in countries with overheated
economies and steep inflation-unemployment
trade-offs. By the same token, in economies with
inflation below target, fiscal expansion or a tilting of
government spending toward items more supportive
of demand, such as targeted household transfers,
may be necessary, subject to available budgetary
room for maneuver.
•• Monitoring financing conditions: Financing conditions in capital markets have eased in the United
States and the euro area (Adrian, Natalucci, and
Wu 2023), which may complicate the task of
fighting inflation. Careful monitoring of serious
misalignment in financing conditions is warranted
given the potential repercussions from a sudden
repricing of risk. Central banks should be ready to
deploy necessary financial stability tools to con-

tain signs of market strain (Adrian, Gopinath, and
Gourinchas 2023).
Strengthening financial supervision and addressing
stress: The fast pace of monetary policy tightening
continues to put the financial sector under pressure.
Strengthened supervision (through implementation
of Basel III and removal of forbearance measures) and
the monitoring of risks to anticipate further episodes
of banking sector stress are warranted. The intensity of
supervision should be commensurate with banks’ risks
and systemic importance, and it is essential to rapidly
close oversight gaps in the nonbank financial sector.
Macroprudential policy measures could be employed
preemptively to tackle emerging risks in banks and
nonbank financial institutions. Where market strains
emerge, deploying tools that provide liquidity support
promptly and forcefully, while mitigating the risk of
moral hazard, would limit contagion. In China, where
continued financial stress in the property sector presents a downside risk to global growth, stronger action
by the central government is needed to avert macrofinancial feedback loops. This action should include further efforts to facilitate the exit of insolvent developers
while protecting home buyers’ interests, which would
also help restore home buyer confidence. Countries at
risk of external shocks can make full use of the global
financial safety net afforded by international financial
institutions, including IMF precautionary financial
arrangements.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Navigating Global Divergences

Normalizing fiscal policy: With fiscal deficits
and government debt above prepandemic levels
and debt-service costs as a share of GDP rising
(Figure 1.26), tightening the fiscal stance is warranted
in numerous cases to restore room for budgetary
maneuver. In low-income and developing countries,
interest payments constitute nearly one-eighth of
­general government revenues. For countries with limited fiscal space, shifting the composition of spending
toward items that provide targeted support to households can support activity. Careful communication of
medium-term fiscal policy plans is needed to support
credibility and avert disruptive market responses. Where
countries are in or at high risk of debt distress, achieving debt sustainability may require not only well-timed
fiscal consolidation, but also debt restructuring (see
Chapter 3 of the April 2023 WEO). Domestic revenue
mobilization, more efficient spending, and improved
institutional fiscal frameworks are increasingly pertinent
for emerging market and developing economies given
high debt levels and sizable spending needs.
Supporting the vulnerable: The composition of fiscal
adjustment should protect the most vulnerable, by
means of targeted support to households, among other
methods, especially in the context of large swings in
energy and food prices. Phasing out untargeted fiscal
measures, especially those that blunt price signals—
such as energy subsidies—is warranted as energy prices
return to prepandemic levels.
Avoiding debt distress: Large short-term external
financing needs are stretching the ability of numerous
emerging market economies and low-income countries to service their debt. Sovereign spreads remain
elevated, impeding access to credit for many economies
reliant on short-term borrowing. Faster and more
efficient coordination on debt resolution, through the
G20 Common Framework and the Global Sovereign
Debt Roundtable, among other options, would help
mitigate the risk of debt distress spreading. The recent
agreement between Zambia and its official creditor
committee is a welcome step in that direction.
Improving food security: Extreme weather conditions—
heat waves, floods, and wildfires—are exacerbating risks
to the global supply of staple crops, including risks from
the war in Ukraine, and threaten food security for millions of people. In this context, trade restrictions aimed
at reducing domestic prices could worsen global food
insecurity and create shortages for the world’s poorest
people. Bans on food exports should be lifted as soon
as feasible to safeguard the global flow of food supplies.

24

International Monetary Fund | October 2023

Strengthened multilateral cooperation on food security
is needed, with strengthened rules-based frameworks for
restrictions on food exports (see Chapter 3).
Enhancing labor supply: Reforms that reduce labor
market tightness—by encouraging participation and
reducing job search and job matching frictions—would
facilitate fiscal consolidation and contribute gradually
to easing inflation. Such reforms include short-term
training programs for professions experiencing shortages and labor laws and regulations that increase work
flexibility through telework and leave policies. Policies
that encourage more women and older people to join
the workforce, reduce labor market duality, and improve
mobility would further enhance labor supply. Active
immigration policies in advanced economies can address
labor shortages as well as longer-term headwinds to
growth, including those from population aging.

Policies with Medium-Term Payoffs
Intensifying macrostructural reforms: Targeted and
carefully sequenced structural reforms can equip policymakers with additional levers to reinforce productivity
growth despite constrained policy space. This is all the
more important given the decline in medium-term
growth prospects (Box 1.1). Making a priority of and
bundling reforms that alleviate the most critical binding
constraints to economic activity—such as governance,
business regulation, and external sector reforms—can
help front-load the resulting output gains, which helps
ensure public buy-in. IMF staff analysis for emerging market and developing economies (Budina and
others 2023) suggests that output gains from reforms
can be substantial, even in the short term. In cases
with large initial gaps in structural indicators relative
to the best performance, a bundled and sequenced
reform package is estimated to lift the level of output
by 4 percent in two years and 8 percent in four years.
Gains of this magnitude would significantly narrow the
aforementioned output losses from the pandemic for
these economies. More broadly, reforms ranging from
enhancing human capital by expanding health care
coverage and increasing access to early childhood and
higher education, to reducing barriers to competition
and supporting start-ups, to deepening digitalization
would, ­depending on the economy in which they were
enacted, enhance productivity. By accelerating growth,
such reforms can also help assuage concerns about
potential short-term growth costs of ambitious green
reforms, including those that operate through energy

prices (see Chapter 2 of the October 2022 WEO), and
create the necessary fiscal space for implementation. In
general, mitigating the potential adverse distributional
effects of reforms across economic groups (including
those relating to gender and age) requires complementary policies, including targeted support and regulations
to ensure that the reform benefits are shared. Industrial
policies could be pursued where externalities or market
failures are well established and other policies are not
available but should avoid protectionist provisions and
be consistent with international agreements and World
Trade Organization (WTO) rules.
Speeding the green transition and mitigating the
effects of climate change: Reductions in global emissions are needed to mitigate climate change. Environmental performance varies widely across firms
within industries (Figure 1.27). Laggards—firms with
high emissions per unit of output relative to industry peers—operate older physical capital and are less
knowledge-intensive and productive (Capelle and
others, forthcoming). Significant emissions cuts could
be achieved by helping these firms approach current
technological frontiers. Carbon pricing and subsidies
for green investments would support the adoption of
frontier technologies, helping make production both
greener and more efficient. Carbon border-adjustment

Global Prospects and Policies

mechanisms can encourage trading partners to decarbonize and can ensure an equal footing for domestic
producers and those in countries with less ambitious
carbon-emissions-reduction targets, but they must be
designed carefully to support consistency with WTO
rules. Green industrial policies—currently pursued in
China, the United States, and the European Union—
complement carbon pricing to speed the transition.
However, they also should be designed in a manner
that avoids distortions to international trade (such
as domestic-content provisions) and investment, also
in line with WTO rules. In parallel, investments in
climate adaptation activities and infrastructure are
needed, especially for the regions most vulnerable to
climate shocks. Enhancing climate-risk-monitoring
systems and risk management frameworks and stronger
safety nets and insurance are also needed to enhance
climate resilience (October 2023 Fiscal Monitor).
Establishing a “green corridor” and increasing data
sharing: A green corridor agreement is necessary to
safeguard the international flow of critical minerals needed for the green transition. It should transcend geopolitical boundaries and be guided by the
principles of common climate goals rather than
beggar-thy-neighbor policies. Similar agreements could
stabilize essential agricultural commodity markets by
dampening supply volatility in the wake of adverse
shocks. Prudent risk management also calls for
investing in diversified supply sources to minimize the
potential fallout in case of further fragmentation in
commodity markets. A lack of data on critical minerals
for the green transition raises uncertainty for producers
and consumers and leads to price volatility. An international platform or organization could improve data
sharing and standardization (see Chapter 3).
Strengthening multilateral cooperation and mitigating
the effects of fragmentation: Multilateral cooperation is
vital for achieving progress in dealing with the interlocking challenges holding back global recovery. Joint
action is needed on many fronts, and further geoeconomic fragmentation would trigger costly delays.
Restoring trust in multilateral frameworks is urgently
needed to revive a rules-based platform of international
cooperation, to foster shared global prosperity, and to
regulate potentially disruptive emerging technologies
such as artificial intelligence. At the center of such
reforms, enhancing trade policy certainty should be a
priority. Necessary first steps should include restoring
binding dispute settlement in the WTO and clarifying
the application of key WTO rules to climate measures.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Navigating Global Divergences

Box 1.1. Dimming Growth Prospects: A Longer Path to Convergence
Since the global financial crisis in 2008, forecasters
have steadily diminished their expectations for growth
over the medium term. Global five-year-ahead growth
projections from the World Economic Outlook (WEO)
have declined from a peak of 4.9 percent in the April
2008 WEO for growth in 2013 to 3.0 percent in the
April 2023 WEO for growth in 2028: the lowest projection since 1990 (Figure 1.1.1). Forecasters at other
institutions—as surveyed by Consensus Economics––
have similarly reduced their expectations. If the focus
is WEO forecasts, the decline in growth prospects
started in the early 2000s for advanced economies,
while emerging market and developing economies
experienced a similar decline after the crisis. Of the
1.9 percentage point global decline in medium-term
growth prospects from 2008 to 2023, advanced
economies contributed 0.8 percentage point; emerging market and developing economies contributed
1.1 percentage points. Among emerging market and
developing economies, low-income developing countries increased their contribution to projected global
growth slightly during the same period (Figure 1.1.2).
The world’s largest 10 economies, and 81 percent of all
economies, have seen a decline in their medium-term
growth prospects (Figure 1.1.3). The five largest
emerging markets––Brazil, China, India, Indonesia,
and Russia––have contributed about 0.9 percentage
point to the decline in medium-term global growth
prospects between 2008 and 2023. East Asia and the
Pacific’s outlook has seen the largest downshift. The
global medium-term outlook further declined after
the shocks of 2020–22—including the COVID-19
pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine––from
3.6 percent in the January 2020 WEO to 3.0 percent
in the April 2023 WEO, with 52 percent of economies (all of them middle-income economies) seeing
a decline.
A natural question is whether the decline in
forecasters’ expectations for the global economy over
the past 15 years has been excessively pessimistic,
with outcomes likely to be better than expected. An
examination of the bias in WEO forecast errors over
time––the average difference between actual outcomes
and forecasts––suggests that the answer is no. Forecasts
were mostly aligned with growth outcomes during
1995–2008. After the global financial crisis, forecasts
exhibited––if anything––some upward bias, with
realized growth over the medium term falling short

of medium-term predictions.1 This suggests that the
downward trajectory in the projections could in part
reflect correcting for forecast optimism since the crisis.
A deeper look through forecasters’ lenses sheds
light on the factors driving the decline. First,
three-quarters of the reduction in global growth
prospects (about 1.4 percentage points) over the past
15 years has come from weaker per capita growth
projections rather than merely slower population
growth. Second, it is instructive to note that per
capita growth can be decomposed into changes in
capital per worker (or “capital deepening”), labor
force participation, the employment rate (employment as a share of the labor force), and total factor
productivity (TFP) (see Abiad and others 2009).2
1The assessment is based on the regression ​e​ ​ = α + ​ε​ ​​, in
i,t
i,t
which ​e​i,t​ is the growth forecast error, defined as the five-year
end-of-period moving average of realized growth rates minus
the five-year-ahead forecast, conducted as a vintage-by-vintage
regression over the period 1990–2017, with the last vintage
chosen to compare against the output realization for 2022. The
results are robust to using actual growth rates instead of the
moving average.
2The term capturing labor force participation also reflects
changes in the share of the working age population in
total population.

For advanced economies, the decline in per capita
output growth in the recent forecasts relative to the
forecasts for the early 2000s is attributed predominantly to lower TFP growth, followed by the decline
in labor force participation and the slowdown in
capital deepening (Figure 1.1.4). This reflects forecasters’ views on future TFP growth, potentially due
to unbalanced technological advances across sectors
(Acemoglu, Autor, and Patterson 2023), frictions
preventing efficient resource allocation (Baqaee and
Farhi 2020), or diminishing returns to innovation
(Bloom and others 2020). The projected decline in
the contribution of labor force participation, which is
broad-based across advanced economies, could reflect
forecasters’ views on the impact of population aging.
The decline in the contribution of capital deepening could reflect views on declining investment
prospects over time, partly on account of scarring
effects on capital formation after the global financial
crisis, and is most pronounced in regard to euro
area economies.3 For emerging market and developing economies, the decline in TFP growth is also
the largest contributor to the slowdown, explaining
about 60 percent, followed by the decline in capital
deepening. The projected decline in TFP growth in
emerging market and developing economies could
reflect fading effects of technological and educational
improvement, the slowdown in reform momentum
in the 2000s relative to the 1990s (October 2019
WEO), and rising fragmentation risks that would
hurt growth in world trade and global value chains.
The projected slowdown in capital deepening is
also a significant contributor in some of the largest
emerging market and developing economies—
such as Brazil and Indonesia.4
The decline in medium-term growth prospects,
especially in emerging market and developing economies, has worrisome implications for the pace of
convergence in living standards. Fifteen years ago,
3The scarring effects of the global financial crisis on investment are documented in the April 2015 World Economic
Outlook. A potential explanation is the relatively larger fiscal
consolidation in euro area economies after the crisis. This may
have prompted expectations of a slower rate of capital accumulation, given evidence suggesting strong complementarity between
public and private investment in European economies (Brasili
and others 2023).
4These trends are generally consistent with estimates of
potential output growth (see, for instance, Kilic Celik, Kose, and
Ohnsorge 2023).

the five-year-ahead growth forecasts in the April 2008
WEO implied a positive and statistically significant
rate of absolute convergence––with poorer countries
growing unconditionally faster than rich countries
by 0.9 percent annually. At this rate of convergence,
economies’ progress in raising their living standards
and the associated decline in the rate of change
might have been expected to translate into a decline
in global growth over time. Accordingly, IMF staff
estimates suggest that up to 0.4 percentage point of
the aforementioned decline in per capita global growth
prospects since 2008 may reflect income convergence.5
In contrast, the five-year-ahead growth forecasts in
the April 2023 WEO imply a convergence rate of
only 0.5 percent a year, corresponding to the flatter
relationship shown in Figure 1.1.5. These forecasts
imply that the expected number of years needed for
emerging market and developing economies to close
half the gap in income per capita with advanced economies has significantly increased. For example, based
on the population-weighted estimates in Figure 1.1.5,
this half-life estimate has on average increased from
80 years for projections in the April 2008 WEO to
about 130 years for projections in the April 2023
WEO. What is more, these estimates are population
weighted, meaning that they give greater weight to
more populous and faster-growing countries, such as
China and India. Unweighted regressions—indicated
in the figure by black lines—show even slower
expected convergence rates that decline to near zero
in the April 2023 WEO projections. Poorer countries
have already suffered greater income losses during the
recovery from the pandemic (Brussevich, Liu, and
Papageorgiou 2022). The slower prospects for income
convergence suggest a particularly difficult road ahead.
5The expected (absolute) convergence rate implied by projections in the April 2008 WEO is 0.3 percent when each country
is treated as a unit of analysis and 0.9 percent when countries are
weighted by population. Applying the 0.3–0.9 range of convergence rates to the level of initial GDP per capita across countries
in 2008 implies a decline in global per capita GDP growth of
0.1–0.4 percentage point over 2008–23.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Navigating Global Divergences

Box 1.2. Risk Assessment Surrounding the World Economic Outlook’s Baseline Projections
The IMF’s Group of Twenty (G20) Model is used in
this box to derive confidence bands around the World
Economic Outlook (WEO) forecast and to quantify
alternative scenarios. Uncertainty about 2023 has
narrowed considerably since the April 2023 WEO as
the outturn for the first half of the year is now known.
Beyond 2023, risks to growth are considered more
balanced than in the April 2023 WEO but still tilted to
the downside. The risk of global growth falling below
2 percent—an outcome that has occurred on only five
occasions since 1970—in 2024 is assessed at about
15 percent, compared with 25 percent in April. The
balance of risks for inflation beyond 2023 has shifted
up, reflecting upward revisions to the baseline projection. The risk that core inflation in 2024 will be higher
than in 2023 is assessed at about 15 percent. The
scenarios assess several risks to the outlook. Upside risks
include (1) greater-than-expected disinflation effects
from fading supply disruptions and (2) a greater boost
to global demand from a stronger recovery in investment in advanced economies. Downside risks include
(1) further loss of growth momentum in China, (2)
longer-than-expected transmission lags and larger effects
from the ongoing global monetary tightening cycle, and
(3) tighter financial conditions in emerging markets.

Confidence Bands
The methodology for producing confidence bands
is based on Andrle and Hunt (2020) and was used in
the October 2022 and April 2023 WEO reports. The
G20 model, presented in Andrle and others (2015), is
used to interpret historical data on output, inflation,
and international commodity prices and to recover
the implied economic shocks to aggregate demand
and supply. The recovered shocks are sampled through
non-parametric methods and fed back through the
model to generate predictive distributions around the
WEO projections. Distributions for global macro variables are then obtained by aggregating country-level
estimates. There are two changes to the distributions
for growth and inflation outcomes relative to April.
First, shocks from 1982 were sampled more heavily
in the previous WEO to stress the risk of a more
pronounced slowdown from contractionary monetary
policy. Here instead, shocks are sampled uniformly,
consistent with risks to the outlook having become
more balanced. While risks from monetary policy

Rodriguez, and Rafael Portillo.

International Monetary Fund | October 2023

remain relevant for the current outlook, they are
evaluated through a scenario instead of a shift in the
predictive distribution. Second, the distribution for
2023 shocks has shrunk as the outturn for the first
half of the year is already known.
Figure 1.2.1 (panels 1, 2, and 3) shows the distributions for global growth and inflation projections
that result from the approach and assumptions just
discussed. Each shade of blue represents a 5 percentage
point interval, and the entire band covers 90 percent
of the distribution. Regarding global growth, the range
of possible outcomes has narrowed and shifted up
relative to April. There is a 70 percent probability that
global growth will be between 2.6 percent and 3.4 percent in 2023—a narrower range than in April—and
a 70 percent probability that growth will be between
1.9 percent and 4.0 percent in 2024.
Regarding global inflation, uncertainty around 2023
has narrowed for both the headline and core figures:
there is now a 70 percent probability that 2023
headline inflation could be about 0.7 percentage point
higher or lower than currently projected, lower than
the 1.2 percent band shown in April. Beyond 2023,
risks have tilted up with the revision to the baseline:
the probability that headline inflation in 2024 will be
higher than in 2023 is assessed at 25 percent, compared with less than 10 percent in April. Similarly, the
probability that core inflation in 2024 will be higher
than in 2023 is assessed at 15 percent, compared with
about 5 percent back in April.

Risk Scenarios
The April 2023 WEO presented a single large downside scenario for the world economy, centered around
a large shock to credit supply. While financial risks
remain, the probability of a severe scenario from banking sector developments has receded. Instead, this box
quantifies several upside and downside risks. While
each of the risks quantified here implies relatively
moderate effects on global growth and inflation, several
could materialize at the same time, in which case the
global impact would be correspondingly larger. The
scenarios assume that monetary policy and automatic
fiscal stabilizers respond endogenously to macro developments, without additional policy support.

Upside Risks
Greater-than-expected global disinflation from
further supply normalization: Supply constraints
have been an important factor in the global inflation

surge experienced during the pandemic recovery,
both directly through higher goods inflation early on
and indirectly by raising marginal costs. As multiple
indicators point to normalization, fading supply disruptions are now helping with the ongoing disinflation. The scenario assumes that the global disinflation
impulse is greater than in the baseline forecast, with
the consumer price of manufactured goods relative to
services—currently estimated to be 1 percent above
the global aggregate trend prior to the COVID-19
pandemic—returning to trend over a two-year horizon. The additional impulse in the scenario is larger in
countries, mainly advanced economies, that are starting from a higher relative goods price, with an impulse
equal to –20 basis points of core inflation in 2023 and
–50 basis points in 2024 (relative to baseline). For
the remaining countries, except China, the impulse is
two-thirds as large; China experiences a smaller shock.
The lower-than-expected inflation raises purchasing
power globally and allows central banks to lower
rates at a more rapid pace over the scenario horizon,
supporting global consumption, investment, and trade.
Stronger recovery in investment in advanced
economies: Investment has been lagging since the
COVID-19 crisis period ended, with global gross fixed
capital formation remaining close to 10 percent below
prepandemic trends. The scenario assumes investment
grows by more than in the baseline over the next two
years for several advanced economies, reflecting both
(1) greater sensitivity to the expected recovery in some
regions and sectors, and easing financial conditions,
and (2) a stronger-than-expected boost from current
policy packages (US Inflation Reduction Act, EU
recovery fund). Higher investment supports global
demand and trade but also adds to inflationary pressures, with the added assumption that Phillips curves
are twice as sensitive to demand, as a result of the current inflation environment, which elicits a stronger policy response. However, the increase is modest in size:
in the scenario, investment is 3 percent higher than the
baseline by 2025 for the advanced economies group.

Downside Risks
Subdued confidence weighing on China’s outlook: The scenario assumes a deeper-than-expected
contraction in the real estate sector in the absence of
swift action to restructure property developers, weaker
consumption in the context of subdued confidence,
and lack of meaningful policy support. As a result,
China’s private consumption and gross fixed capital

formation decline through 2025 by about –5 percent
and –3.5 percent, relative to baseline. The shock fades
beyond 2025.
Longer transmission lags and greater-than-expected
effects from global monetary policy tightening: The
relative resilience of the global economy in the first
half of 2023 has raised the question of whether the
full effect from the ongoing global monetary tightening is yet to be seen. The scenario assumes that the
effects are larger than what is in the current WEO
baseline, that the additional impulse in each country is proportional to the change in real rates since
the beginning of the tightening cycle, and that the
effects materialize by the end of 2023—and especially
in 2024. The calibration draws on the uncertainty
regarding transmission lags and magnitudes from different models and empirical estimates. Specifically, the
shock is calibrated for the United States and the euro
area by comparing the effects so far from the tightening, from the IMF’s G20 Model—which happen
early in the tightening cycle and are smaller—with
the effects from the FRB/US model and the structural
vector autoregression (SVAR) model in Gertler and
Karadi (2015) for the United States and ECB-Base
model for the euro area, which take longer and are
generally larger. The differences between the two
sets of estimates are then fed into the G20 Model as
shocks to aggregate demand, resulting in lower activity
and inflation and a decrease in the policy rate relative
to the baseline. For other G20 countries, the shock to
aggregate demand is calculated as the average of the
US and EU estimates (for each 1 percentage point
increase in the real rate) multiplied by that country’s
real rate increase. The estimated shocks to demand
are largest in advanced economies (Australia, Canada, UK, US) and some emerging market economies
(Brazil, Mexico).
Tighter financial conditions in emerging market economies: While the underlying cause is not
included in the scenario, tighter financial conditions
in emerging markets could result from a combination
of higher-for-longer rates in advanced economies,
especially the United States, and concerns about the
implications for emerging market economies of lower
growth in China. Following an incipient tightening
toward the end of 2023, emerging market economies,
excluding China, experience an increase in sovereign
and corporate premiums of about 200 and 150 basis
points, respectively, in the first half of 2024, relative
to the baseline, with some of the tightening persisting

deviations from the baseline.1 Global aggregates are
shown in bars, while aggregates for advanced economies and emerging markets are shown in red squares
and yellow diamonds, respectively.
The scenarios highlight the broadly balanced nature
of risks to the outlook:
•• The disinflationary scenario generates a decrease in
global core inflation that troughs at –0.4 percentage
point in 2024 relative to the baseline, generating a
0.5 percent increase in global GDP in 2024, which
persists into 2025. The effect is somewhat more
pronounced in advanced economies; as a result,
the latter group sees a decrease in policy rates of
0.3 percentage point, relative to the baseline.
•• The scenario of stronger recovery in investment in
advanced economies generates a modest increase
in global output of up to 0.3 percent by 2025 and
is associated with moderately higher inflation. The
impact on GDP in advanced economies peaks at
0.6 percent in 2025, adding an additional 0.3 percentage point to core inflation and requiring an increase in
policy rates of about 0.75 percentage point, relative to
the baseline. Spillovers to emerging markets are small.
1The impact on growth rates for a given year can be approximated by subtracting the effects on the level of output from the
previous year.

•• The downside scenario for China lowers its GDP
by as much as –1.6 percent in 2025, with a decrease
in core inflation of about 1 percentage point,
relative to the baseline. There are spillovers to
other countries, and the effect on global output is
–0.6 percent by 2025.
•• The scenario of longer monetary lags results in a
decrease in global output of about –0.4 percent by
2024 and a modest decrease in global core inflation
in that year (–0.1 percentage point). The effects
are larger in advanced economies: –0.6 percent for
output and –0.2 percentage point for core inflation.
The main reason for the modest impact on inflation
is that policy rates are lowered by 50 basis points in
advanced economies in 2024 relative to the baseline, which helps soften the impact.
•• Tighter financial conditions in emerging markets
lower the level of global output by –0.5 percent by
2024. The effects are more pronounced in emerging
market economies, but advanced economies are also
negatively affected because of the loss of competitiveness. The inflation responses diverge across
country groups initially—the disinflation is initially
muted in emerging market economies, whose
currencies depreciate, and is more pronounced in
advanced economies, whose currencies appreciate—
before converging in 2025.

Commodity Special Feature: Market Developments and the
Commodity Price Channel of Monetary Policy
Primary commodity prices declined by 7.5 percent between
February and August 2023. The widespread decline was
led by base metals, with prices falling 15.7 percent, and
European natural gas prices, plummeting 36.0 percent.
The trend decline in cereal prices was temporarily halted
by the collapse of the Black Sea Grain Initiative in
July. Gold prices increased. This Special Feature analyzes the commodity price channel of monetary policy.

Commodity Market Developments
Supply curbs supporting oil prices. Thanks to
a rebound in July and August, crude oil prices
increased, by 4.4 percent, between February and
August 2023, remaining, however, well below their
peak of $115 in June 2022 (Figure 1.SF.1, panels 1
and 3). On the demand side, a weaker-than-expected
rebound in China’s oil consumption, temporary recession fears because of banking woes, and tighter monetary policy in many major economies all contributed
to downward price pressures, especially in the second
quarter of 2023.
On the supply side, output curbs by OPEC+ (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries plus
selected nonmember countries) of 1.2 million barrels
a day (mb/d) announced in April—coupled with
additional voluntary cuts of 1 mb/d and 0.3 mb/d
by Saudi Arabia and Russia, respectively—were only
partly offset by strong oil output growth in non-OPEC
countries, most notably in the United States, where
oil output is expected to increase by 1.1 mb/d this
year. Western sanctions on Russian crude oil exports
have had mixed effects: export flows of Russian oil
have remained fairly steady, and its price discount
relative to Brent oil has shrunk over time—Russian
oil is trading above the $60 price cap imposed by the
Group of Seven (G7) countries—as the size of the
non-Western-aligned oil tanker fleet carrying Russian
oil has increased, and as Russia appears to have set up
its own maritime insurance.

MARKET DEVELOPMENTS AND THE COMMODITY PRICE CHANNEL OF MONETARY POLICY

Futures markets suggest that crude oil prices will
slide by 16.5 percent year over year to average $80.5 a
barrel in 2023 (from $96.4 in 2022) and continue to
fall in coming years, to $72.7 in 2026 (Figure 1.SF.1,
panel 2). The International Energy Agency expects oil
demand to increase by 2.2 mb/d, reaching 102.2 mb/d
in 2023, outstripping supply in the second half of the
year. Uncertainty around this price outlook is elevated
(Figure 1.SF.1, panel 3). Upside price risks stem from
additional OPEC+ production cuts, a military escalation in the Black Sea, and insufficient investment in
fossil fuel extraction. Downside price risks stem from
a widespread global economic relapse, a slowdown in
Chinese oil demand, and faster penetration of electric
vehicles.
Natural gas prices continue to normalize. European
Title Transfer Facility trading hub prices declined
36 percent from February to August 2023 to a
monthly average of $10.7 a million British thermal units (MMBtu) and within the upper range of
historical prices. Lower demand, high storage overhang from this past winter, and ample supplies of
liquefied natural gas (LNG) and of pipeline gas from
Norway and northern Africa have all lowered prices.
Asian LNG prices declined by 26.4 percent, roughly
in lockstep with EU prices. US Henry Hub prices
increased by 8.6 percent from February to average
$2.6/MMBtu in August 2023. The price differential
between US and European gas is expected to slow
gradually as US LNG export capacity expansion picks
up in 2024 and beyond. This is reflected in a slowly
narrowing gap between the US and EU futures price
curves. Title Transfer Facility futures prices suggest that
average annual prices could move from $13.6/MMBtu
to $17.5/MMBtu in 2024 but then down to $9.1/
MMBtu by 2028. US Henry Hub prices are expected
to rise from an annual average of $2.7/MMBtu in
2023 to $3.9/MMBtu in 2028.
Metal prices have weakened. After a short-lived
rebound during the winter, base metal prices declined by
15.7 percent from February to August as China’s reopening lost steam and its real estate sector, which together
with construction accounts for roughly 20 percent of
global metal consumption, kept faltering (Figure 1.SF.1,
panel 1). Higher interest rates and weak European
industrial demand also contributed to the negative
market sentiment. Forecasts for base metal prices have
also been revised downward since the April 2023 World
Economic Outlook, with prices now projected to decline
by 4.7 percent in 2023 and 7.1 percent in 2024. Gold
prices remain high following a slowdown in the Federal

Reserve’s tightening pace and continued demand for
inflation hedges and alternatives to the dollar.
Agricultural prices continue their downward trend.
Between February and August, the IMF’s food and
beverage price index lost 6.7 percent, continuing its
decline, though at a slower pace than in the second
half of 2022. Prices of all major food commodities
except sugar, rice, and pork contributed to the downward trend. As a result of a robust supply response in
the 2022–23 season, grain prices fell consistently and
in August stood 20.7 percent lower than in February.
Grain prices remain, however, 7.7 percent above the
average of the past five years. Food security concerns
prompted recent export restrictions in India, the
world’s largest rice exporter. Risks to prices are tilted
to the upside, stemming mostly from the ramifications of the end of the Black Sea Grain Initiative and
uncertain effects of El Niño (see chapter text), possibly exacerbated by the proliferation of food export
restrictions.

The Commodity Price Channel of
Monetary Policy
Sharp fluctuations in commodity prices, among
other factors, have been blamed for the recent global
surge in inflation and for its subsequent fall (Figure 1.
SF.2) (see, for example, Gagliardone and Gertler 2023;
Blanchard and Bernanke 2023; and Ball, Leigh, and
Mishra 2022). Commodity prices, however, are not
exogenous with respect to the macroeconomy. Indeed,

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Navigating Global Divergences

part of the recent monetary policy reaction to inflation
may have operated through a commodity price channel,
as policy actions from major central banks affect global
activity and financial conditions, which are typically
major drivers of fluctuations in commodity prices.
How quantitatively important is the commodity price
channel of monetary policy—especially US monetary
policy—in driving inflation in the United States and
worldwide?
Empirical analysis of this question has been limited.1
This Special Feature contributes to filling the gap by
estimating the effects of US monetary policy shocks
on commodity prices and, through this channel, their
spillback to the US economy and spillovers to consumer prices in other countries. It also looks at passthrough from commodity prices to consumer prices
and potential asymmetries.

A Conceptual Framework
Among central banks, the Federal Reserve plays a
special role. This is because the bulk of cross-border
capital flows are denominated in dollars, and US monetary policy is a key driver of the global financial cycle
(Dées and Galesi 2021; Miranda-Agrippino and Rey
2020). Changes in US interest rates thus have pronounced repercussions for the rest of the world (Rey
2013).2 Therefore, this analysis will focus on the effects
of US monetary policy shocks (for an analysis of the
effect of European Central Bank shocks, see Online
Annex 1.1).3
Conceptually, US monetary policy can affect
commodity prices through (1) a cost-of-carry channel, by affecting the opportunity cost of commodity
1Recent examples are Breitenlechner, Georgiadis, and Schumann
(2022) and Ider and others (2023).
2The dollar is both an intervention currency and an anchor currency (Gourinchas 2019). This helps propagate US monetary policy
impulses from the center to the periphery and provides a common
component to the global monetary environment. The spillovers of
US monetary policy to the rest of the world are further strengthened
by the importance of dollar funding for global bank balance sheets,
as well as the increasing length and complexity of global supply
chains (Bruno and Shin 2015).
3Policy rate comovement among central banks is elevated. Moreover, US monetary policy shocks seem to lead to policy reactions
and policy surprises from other central banks, such as the Bank of
Canada and the European Central Bank (see Online Annex 1.1 for
details). Kearns, Schrimpf, and Xia (2023) document that spillovers
from other central banks are modest. In the case of China, typically
it is fiscal policy that is more prevalently used for business cycle fluctuations rather than monetary policy. All online annexes are available
at www​.imf​.org/​en/​Publications/​WEO.

storage; (2) a real-economy channel, by affecting current and future commodity consumption;
(3) a liquidity-and-portfolio channel, by affecting
financial conditions and thus trading liquidity in
physical and derivative markets; and (4) an exchange
rate channel, as most commodities are traded in
dollars. Since monetary policy typically has long lags
affecting the real economy, an immediate effect of
a monetary policy shock through the real-economy
channel can work only through expectations and
thus only for easy-to-store commodities.4

The Effects of Monetary Policy Shocks on
Commodity Prices: A High-Frequency Approach
Local projections are used in the analysis presented here to estimate the effects of monetary policy
shocks—as in Jarociński and Karadi (2020)—on
commodity prices.5 The strongest impact is found for
industrial metals (for example, nickel and copper) and
oil. A 10 basis point monetary policy surprise leads to
a 2.5 percent drop in the base metal price index and
a 2 percent drop in oil prices, with the peak responses
after about 20 days (see Figure 1.SF.3). Prices for raw
materials, such as cotton and rubber, also have a similar decline, whereas the reaction of food prices, such
as those for cereals, is smaller (less than 1 percent) and
less precisely estimated.
Results are consistent with the cost-of-carry and
real-economy channels, as higher interest rates increase
the opportunity costs of holding inventories and,
through the delayed effect on economic activity of
higher funding costs, reduce future demand. These
effects are more relevant for commodities with high
storability (for example, base metals).6 The gold price
reaction is very precisely estimated, with the price
dropping by 1.1 percent after 23 days. For a given
exchange rate, this sets a cap for the cost-of-carry channel, since gold prices are moved, during normal times,
4Sizable

monetary policy shocks can also have a nonlinear effect
on commodity prices (Miao, Wu, and Funke 2011).
5Only dollar-denominated commodity prices are considered for
1990–2019. The pure monetary policy surprise from Jarociński and
Karadi (2020), which does not consider central bank information
effects, is used. More details are presented in Online Annex 1.1.
6The responses of natural gas prices (Henry Hub) are not considered, as gas markets present important structural changes throughout
the sample. For the period 1990–2019, natural gas prices do not
respond to US monetary policy. However, for the 2016–19 subsample only, when US natural gas exports increased dramatically, a
significant decline in gas prices after US monetary policy tightening
is observed.

mostly by the opportunity cost of storing gold.7 Monetary policy shocks also affect the dollar, which appreciates by 0.4 percent, but the impact is short-lived.8

The Effects of Monetary Policy Shocks on
Commodity Prices, Spillbacks, and Spillovers
Next, to gauge domestic spillbacks and spillovers from US monetary policy to other countries,
a monthly proxy–structural vector autoregression
approach is used. The analysis first looks at the effects
of the commodity price channel on US inflation. It
then moves on to the effects on other countries’ inflation. The focus is on prices of food and oil, which have
the most direct effects on headline inflation.
7Except in the case of natural gas, the results are robust to choosing different subsample periods, suggesting that the relationship
between monetary policy and commodity prices has not changed
over time. This remains the case even if the sample is broken into
segments before and after 2004, a year typically used to distinguish
between periods before and after the financialization of commodity
markets (Tang and Xiong 2012).
8This suggests that, conditional on a monetary policy shock, the
correlation between the dollar and commodity prices is negative at
high frequencies. Although there is evidence that the unconditional
correlation between commodity prices and the dollar has changed
since 2015 (Hofmann, Igan, and Rees 2023), the analysis presented
in this Special Feature does not find evidence of a change in the relationship between US monetary policy and commodity price indices
for that period (see Online Annex 1.1 for details).

CPI = consumer price index.

The Spillbacks
A 10 basis point increase in the US federal funds
rate induces a decline in oil prices of 2 percent on
impact, and the effect persists for eight months. Food
prices decline by 1 percent, and the effect is less persistent. The responses of the headline consumer price
index (CPI), industrial production, and the exchange
rate are in line with the textbook implications of a
monetary policy tightening (see Figure 1.SF.4 and
Online Annex 1.1).9
9In addition to the monetary policy instrument, the first specification considers seven macroeconomic variables: the one-year Treasury
bill, US headline CPI, US core CPI, US industrial production, the
excess bond premium, the US dollar, the West Texas Intermediate oil
price, and a food price index. The data span 1990–2019. The focus
on food and energy commodities is because their pass-through to
headline inflation is more direct and less delayed than those of other
commodities, such as metals, fertilizers, and raw materials.

2“Contribution MA” presents the contribution of the overall commodity index from
instrumental variables local projection (IV-LP) mediation analysis (MA).

To isolate the commodity price channel of US
monetary policy, in the spirit of Bernanke, Gertler, and
Watson (1997), the impulse response functions are estimated again, with the condition imposed that US monetary policy has no effect on (1) oil prices and (2) both
oil and food prices. If the commodity price channel is
shut down, US monetary policy has smaller effects on
the CPI. As Table 1.SF.1 shows, absent oil and food
price responses, headline CPI would have declined by
0.07 percentage point rather than by 0.12 percentage point in the first half-year, implying a 41 percent
contribution of the commodity price channel. The
contribution is similar for the first year, but it declines
over time as core inflation becomes the main driver (see
Figure 1.SF.4, panel 4). Oil prices have a dominant role,
since oil prices affect food prices but not vice versa.
An instrumental variable–local projection mediation
analysis tends to confirm these results, with an average
commodity price contribution of 43 percent over a halfyear period (see Table 1.SF.1 and Online Annex 1.1).

The Spillovers
Figure 1.SF.5 reports the effects of US monetary
policy on countries’ CPI (in blue), along with the
effect of US monetary policy on countries’ CPI absent
the commodity price channel (red).10 As expected,
10To study the effects of US monetary policy on foreign inflation
through commodity prices, the previous specification is augmented
with the CPI of country i and the bilateral exchange rate for country
i and the United States, with the estimate repeated for a set of 24
countries. The same decomposition is performed to study how much
of the change in country i’s CPI is due to US monetary policy’s
effect on commodity prices.

increase of 10 basis points in the US interest rate. Error bars are 68 percent
conﬁdence intervals. Data labels in the ﬁgure use International Organization for
Standardization (ISO) country codes. CPI = consumer price index.

most countries’ CPIs decline after a US monetary
policy tightening. The role of the commodity price
channel is quantitatively important for several countries. As highlighted in Table 1.SF.1, for the average
country, the commodity price channel accounts for
66 percent of the total spillover of US monetary policy
onto inflation in the first half-year. The oil price alone
contributes 48 percent.

Asymmetric Pass-Through
Some observers have suggested that in the most
recent episode of heightened inflation, the passthrough from global commodity prices to domestic
consumer prices increased. It has also been suggested
that producers are eager to pass cost changes on to
consumers when commodity prices are on the rise but
refrain from doing so when commodity prices decline.
Finally, producers may also pass a larger fraction of
commodity price changes on to consumer prices when
the changes to commodity prices are larger and happen
more quickly, attracting the attention of producers by
virtue of their salience.

energy inflation on food commodity price and oil price

inflation, there is also evidence that the food price
pass-through is heightened for larger and thus more
salient shocks (Figure 1.SF.6, panel 2).

Sources: Ha, Kose, and Ohnsorge (2021); and IMF staff calculations.
Note: Shaded area is 90 percent conﬁdence interval. Numbers on x-axis represent
months after shock. Coefﬁcient on large (small) price movements estimated on
subsample of price changes larger than (smaller or equal to) one standard
deviation.

shocks are conducted to test these hypotheses. For food
inflation, there is no evidence that the pass-through
is higher during commodity price booms than busts
or that the pass-through for price increases is larger
than that for price decreases. However, some evidence
shows that the pass-through of large oil price shocks
to domestic energy inflation could be twice the size of
that for small ones (Figure 1.SF.6, panel 1). For food

Monetary policy has a strong direct effect on
commodity prices, especially those of industrial and
storable commodities such as oil and metals. Spillbacks
and spillovers to other countries from US monetary
policy shocks are fast. After a 10 basis point monetary
policy shock, the decline in oil and food prices over
the course of six months reduces both domestic and
other countries’ inflation by 0.05 percent on average.
This result implies that the commodity price channel
of US monetary policy has relatively larger spillovers
to other countries than spillbacks to the United States.
Whereas the commodity price channel accounts for
41 percent of the total decline in US headline CPI, it
accounts for 66 percent of the total decline in headline
CPI for the average country in the sample.
Spillovers from US monetary policy shocks tend to
be more relevant for consumer prices in other advanced
economies, whereas the reaction of consumer prices in
emerging market economies and their commodity price
channels are less precisely estimated, as emerging markets
tend to have more regulated prices. There is no significant commodity price channel for core inflation. Major
central banks, when setting policy objectives, should
consider their spillbacks and spillovers through a commodity price channel and expect stronger pass-through
during times of sharp commodity price changes (relative
to times of small changes). Finally, as the Federal Reserve
tends to set the tone for the global monetary policy
stance, and given that other major central banks such as
the European Central Bank can also affect commodity
prices, the commodity price channel could be strengthened in periods of high monetary policy coordination.

MANAGING EXPECTATIONS: INFLATION AND MONETARY POLICY

Inflation reached multidecade highs in many economies
in 2022. While headline inflation has since come down
as supply chain disruptions have eased and commodity
prices have declined, core inflation is proving stickier. The
specter of high inflation becoming embedded in expectations and leading to pricing choices that keep inflation
high haunts central banks. This chapter unpacks recent
patterns in inflation expectations and studies their role
in driving inflation, and the implications for monetary
policy. Expectations from professional forecasters, financial
markets, and households and a new indicator for firms’
views agree about broad inflation dynamics. Historical episodes in which inflation expectations rose over a
sustained period of at least a year suggest that it takes
about three years for inflation and near-term (over the
next 12 months) inflation expectations to come back to
pre-episode levels on average, given historical monetary
policy reactions. Although long-term (five years in the
future) inflation expectations have generally remained
anchored on average, near-term expectations have risen
markedly across economies since 2022. Empirical estimates of the expectations channel point to the growing
importance of near-term expectations for understanding
inflation dynamics. Using a new macroeconomic model
with a mix of forward- and backward-looking learners,
analysis shows how economies with greater shares of more
backward-looking learners prolong price pressures and
diminish the potency of monetary policy, since such agents
do not consider the future impacts of monetary policy.
The share of backward-looking learners in the economy is
estimated to be larger in emerging market than advanced
economies. By fostering an increase in the share of
forward-looking learners, improvements in monetary policy frameworks and central bank communication strategies
can help bring inflation back to target more quickly and
at a lower output cost—in other words, they can increase
the chances that the economy makes a “soft landing.”

Introduction
In the wake of the shocks of the COVID-19
pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, inflation around the world reached multidecade highs in
2022, well above central bank targets, particularly
in advanced economies (see Chapter 1, Figure 1.7).
As policy tightening gradually rebalances aggregate
demand toward potential output, supply chain disruptions have eased, and commodity prices have declined,
headline inflation is coming down, but underlying
price pressures (as captured by core inflation) remain
elevated. Professional forecasters expect inflation rates
will return closer to central banks’ targets in 2024,
with a shift in their median deviation toward zero and
a sharp narrowing of the distribution (Figure 2.1).1
However, they also expect that, given the current
contractionary stance and anticipated policy action
going forward, rates will be fully back at targets only
by 2026, on average.
Since consumption and investment decisions as
well as price- and wage-setting processes partly reflect
households’ and firms’ expectations about the future
pace of price changes, inflation expectations play a
critical role in shaping inflation dynamics. Amid the
current higher inflation environment, some observers
have expressed concerns that expectations could remain
elevated or even rise further and long-term expectations could de-anchor from target inflation rates. In
turn, expectations that future inflation will rise could
feed into current inflation rates, keeping them high. If
an expectations channel for inflation is important, it
also means that policies that bring expectations down
could help to lower inflation more quickly and easily.
The idea is that the more effective monetary policymakers are in influencing inflation expectations, the
lower the cost in forgone output involved in central
banks achieving their inflation objectives (Sargent
1983; Ball 1994). In other words, the expectations
channel is critical to whether central banks can achieve

the elusive “soft landing” of bringing the inflation rate
down to target without a recession.
The relevance of inflation expectations for an
economy’s inflation dynamics likely depends on the
prevailing context and recent experience, as well as
on the measures of inflation expectations considered
(for example, near- versus long-term mean expectations). In general, when expected inflation is systematically far from actual inflation, what expectations
measure is most salient for understanding inflation
dynamics is an open question (Werning 2022).
When inflation is low and stable at central bank
targets, economic agents may become inattentive,
reducing the information content of expectations
(Coibion and others 2020). This may have characterized the situation in many advanced economies prior
to the COVID-19 pandemic (Reis 2021). However,
when inflation rises sharply or becomes volatile, then
economic agents may become more attentive, and
expectations may become an important driver of
actual inflation.
Motivated by these considerations, this chapter
aims to contribute to the large and growing literature
on inflation expectations by examining alternative
indicators of inflation expectations, their importance
for inflation dynamics, and how their behavior may
50

influence monetary policy effectiveness and vice versa.2
It addresses the following questions:
•• How have inflation expectations across different
agents and at alternative horizons behaved before
and after the pandemic across economies? Are there
signs of inflation expectations deanchoring since
2021? Or do the rapid interest rate hikes over 2022
appear to have contained risks?
•• How important are expectations in explaining inflation dynamics, particularly since the COVID-19
shock? Does the prevailing level of inflation (high
or low) affect the explanatory power of inflation
expectations?
•• How do expectations affect monetary policy effectiveness, and how does policy affect expectations?
How does the expectations formation process affect
the trade-offs that monetary policymakers face to
bring inflation rates back to their targets?
Drawing on empirical and model-based analyses, the
chapter’s main findings are as follows:
•• Across economic agents, movements in near-term
(next-12-months) inflation expectations broadly concur,
showing a sharp rise in 2022. Survey-based measures
of expectations of professional forecasters and households, financial-market-implied expectations, and
this chapter’s newly constructed measure of firms’
expectations (based on the text analysis of firms’
earnings calls) fluctuate differently, but around a
common trend.
•• Despite the sharp increase in inflation over 2022 across
many economies, long-term (five-year-ahead) inflation
expectations in the average economy have remained stable. According to multiple metrics—including inflation target deviations, expectations’ variability, and
2Recent

IMF policy contributions on the topic include Chapter 3 of
the October 2018 World Economic Outlook (WEO), which concluded
that more anchored inflation expectations improve the economic
resilience of emerging market economies; Chapter 2 of the October 2021 WEO, which presented evidence that long-term inflation
expectations remained anchored after the pandemic; and Chapter 2
of the October 2022 WEO, which found that the explanatory power
of inflation expectations for wages after the pandemic had grown and
that strong action by monetary policy to counter inflationary shocks
could help ensure expectations remain anchored. Among the notable
recent empirical and theoretical contributions on the topic of inflation
expectations in the academic literature, see Bems and others (2021),
Binder (2017), Coibion and others (2020), and Reis (2020), among
many others. See also Kose and others (2019) for another overview of
the literature and an examination of expectations in selected emerging
market and developing economies. Note that the chapter’s focus on
expectations should not be taken to suggest that they are the sole
driver of inflation dynamics. They are a key contributor, but other
factors are also important, as described later.

CHAPTER 2

expectations’ disagreement—long-term expectations
have remained well anchored in most economies.
•• Historical episodes characterized by initial periods of persistently rising expectations suggest that expectations come
down only slowly. In these cases, it took about three
years for inflation and near-term expectations to return
to their pre-episode levels. Notably, real policy rates
were lower and are now higher, on average, compared
with those in past episodes, suggesting that monetary
tightening since 2022 has been unusually sharp.
•• Near-term expectations are critical to understanding
inflation dynamics and explain a growing share of
inflation since 2022. Using a novel causal identification strategy to estimate Phillips curves, the chapter
finds a strong role for inflation expectations in the
group of advanced economies. In emerging market economies, lagged inflation is also important,
suggesting a greater role for more backward-looking
learners. There are also signs that the pass-through
from inflation expectations to inflation tends to be
higher in periods of higher inflation, such as those
experienced of late throughout the world.
•• The properties of the expectations formation process
have a strong impact on the effectiveness of monetary
policy, making central banks’ understanding of them
key. A newly developed dynamic stochastic general
equilibrium model with a mix of forward- and
backward-looking agents that learn demonstrates
that the output costs of monetary tightening rise
with the share of backward-looking learners in the
economy or with the prevailing level of inflation.3
The analysis also shows that both inflation expectations and inflation would decline modestly more
quickly with improvements in monetary policy
frameworks and communication—such as simpler
and more regular messaging and better targeting of
audiences—that boost the share of forward-looking
learners in the economy. However, such measures
may take time or be more difficult to implement
than tighter cyclical policies, which come with much
higher costs in terms of slowing growth.
In general, inflation dynamics depend on the shares
of forward- versus backward-looking learners in the economy and their influence on expectations. If central banks
3In technical terms, the forward-looking learners form their
expectations according to the standard, full-information rational
expectations assumptions, whereas the backward-looking learners
form their expectations through adaptive learning based on a small
statistical model of the variables of interest for expectations, updating
the model based on recent and past experiences only. See Online
Annex 2.5 for further details.

Managing Expectations: Inflation and Monetary Policy

were to focus solely on bringing inflation down quickly,
they would tighten even further and reduce the time
required to bring inflation rates back to targets by two
years, but at the cost of a sharper economic slowdown.
When policymakers choose policies to take account of
the trade-offs among the objectives of inflation close to
target, output at potential, and smooth policy rate paths
(helping manage financial stability concerns), a scenario
for a representative advanced economy facing today’s
inflation cirumstances suggests that it is likely to take
about three to four years for inflation and expectations to
converge back to the central bank’s target.4
Given the role of central banks in influencing the
transmission of monetary policy, the chapter’s findings
suggest that they benefit from having clear understandings of the expectations formation processes at work
in their economies and tailoring their communications strategies accordingly, in parallel with structural
reforms to reinforce central bank independence and
transparency. Managing expectations better could
require investing more in data collection and monitoring of expectations, including across different agents.
Technological improvements mean that alternative
methods of measuring expectations—such as the
text-based analysis of firms’ earnings calls pioneered
here—may make this more feasible.
Some caveats to the analysis and findings in this
chapter should be highlighted. First, data limitations
constrain the empirical analysis of inflation expectations across exercises and, especially, cross-agent
comparisons. To ensure the broadest sample coverage, the chapter takes a macroeconomic perspective
and focuses on mean expectations, typically among
professional forecasters, rather than the distribution
or behavior of individual-level expectations, which are
not widely available.5 This may be preferable, because
the analysis can provide more practical insights for
4Note

that this conclusion is based on a stylized social welfare
function (see Online Annex 2.5 for more details). See Chapter 1 of
the April 2023 Global Financial Stability Report for a discussion of
the financial stability implications of the monetary policy stance and
their impact on central bank choices.
5Although this chapter focuses on mean inflation expectations
to ensure broad country coverage, the distribution of expectations
across individuals might also play an important role. See Reis (2023)
and Clements, Rich, and Tracy (2023) for arguments regarding the
importance for inflation of disagreements in expectations across individuals and agents. Many of the latest studies dive into the microeconomic data on inflation expectations by individuals for specific
economies, contrasting their properties across agents or undertaking
randomized controlled trials to identify influences on expectations.
See Andre and others (2022), Candia and others (2023), D’Acunto
and others (2020), Weber and others (2022), and Weber and others
(2023) for recent examples.

policymakers, who likely face many of the same data
constraints. Second, the causal interpretation of the
Phillips curve estimates is conditional on the assumptions of the instrumental variables estimation strategy
based on lags. As detailed in Online Annex 2.4, the
findings are largely robust to varying the timing of
the instruments, providing some comfort. However,
if the underlying assumptions do not hold, then the
estimates should be interpreted as associational. Third,
if there have been structural breaks in the behavior of
the economy, then the empirical and historical analyses
may not be as informative. State dependence in the
Phillips curve analysis addresses one possible form
of break. The model-based analysis also affords some
insurance against potential structural breaks, incorporating a limited form of structural change through
learning. Fourth, the model-based analysis findings on
the impact of improved monetary policy frameworks
and communications on expectations and inflation are
illustrative. The mapping from an increase in the share
of forward- compared with backward-looking agents
in the economy to monetary policy framework and
communications improvements is stylized.6
The chapter begins by presenting patterns in
inflation expectations, focusing on the postpandemic
recovery. It compares them with the observed patterns
after historical episodes in which expectations rose
over an extended period. The chapter then uses a novel
identification approach to study the channel from
expectations to inflation and how well recent inflation
dynamics can be explained by expectations. The penultimate section describes the results of a model-based
analysis with a mix of forward- and backward-looking
learning agents to examine how the expectations formation process may influence the conduct of monetary
policy and vice versa. The final section suggests potential policy actions in light of the chapter’s findings.

It then analyzes the evolution of near- and long-term
inflation expectations of professional forecasters. Finally, it
puts current macroeconomic dynamics into historical perspective by comparing them with those in past episodes
in which both near- and long-term inflation expectations
rose over a sustained period.

Expectations on Broad Inflation Dynamics Similar
across Agents

This section first compares the recent behavior of inflation expectations across professional forecasters, financial
markets, households, and firms for selected economies.

Different economic agents may not have the
same inflation expectations, reflecting their different
information sets, attention, and priorities, among
other factors. This subsection shows how indicators of
near-term inflation expectations across agents (professional forecasters, financial markets, households, and
firms) have behaved since 2017 for a selected set of
four major economies for which comparable data are
available (Figure 2.2).7 To address the scarcity of data
on firm-level expectations across economies and time,
a new indicator of firms’ inflation expectations is constructed using text analysis of firms’ earnings calls (see
Box 2.1 for details). For comparability, expectations by
agent type are transformed into z-scores.8
Across economies, the four agents’ near-term
expectations display broadly similar patterns, agreeing
on the inflation upswing from 2021, but with some
variation in the timing. They concur that inflation
peaked in 2022 and is now on the downswing. Each of
the indicators, by agent and across economies, reaches
two-and-a-half to more than four standard deviations,
pointing to the extraordinary size of the rise in inflation expectations during the postpandemic recovery
compared with the experience since the early 2000s.
Different agents’ inflation expectations exhibit
slightly different properties. Households’ inflation
expectations appear noisier, leading and lagging
movements in other agents’ expectations (for the
euro area and the United Kingdom, respectively).
Financial-market-implied inflation expectations,
derived from inflation-indexed bonds or inflation
swaps, have continuous real-time availability, but
disentangling the signal on expectations from the

6Although the chapter demonstrates that improvements in monetary policy frameworks and communications are consistent with an
increase in the share of forward-looking learners, it cannot exclude
the possibility that other institutional or structural interventions (for
example, educational attainment, fiscal frameworks, governance, and
so on) could also be associated with a change in the expectations
formation process. However, a full examination of these alternative
interventions lies outside the scope of this chapter.

7As noted in the introduction, the lack of widely available data
on inflation expectations—particularly from financial markets,
households, and firms—limits the economy and time coverage of the
various analytical exercises undertaken in the chapter.
8The z-score transformation takes a variable and subtracts its sample mean, then divides the resulting quantity by the sample standard
deviation of the variable. It is unit free and implicitly range adjusted,
allowing for ready comparison of dynamics across different variables.

Typically, professional forecasters’ expectations fall
somewhere between the more volatile, yet continuously available, market-implied and noisier household
expectations. They also have the advantage of the
broadest coverage among expectations measures across
economies, time, and forecast horizon. As such, the
analyses of the chapter mostly use the expectations of
professional forecasters.

risen, whereas deviations of long-term expectations

and long terms (Figure 2.3, panels 1 and 3). Near-term
expectations rose markedly after 2021. If anything,
long-term expectations in advanced economies have
moved closer to inflation targets since the pandemic.
For emerging market economies, the distribution
of near-term inflation expectations is somewhat wider
and skewed to the upside, indicating greater variation
in inflation experiences, particularly in recent quarters
(Figure 2.3, panel 2). Median long-term inflation
expectations have moved upward by a modest 10
basis points (Figure 2.3, panel 4). The interquartile
range for long-term expectations has narrowed and
shifted up somewhat. Overall, though, the patterns
suggest that long-term inflation expectations have
remained stable.
For both advanced and emerging market economies,
multiple metrics of inflation expectations anchoring—
related to the average absolute deviations from target,
variability of expectations over time, and disagreement
about expectations across individuals—suggest that
long-term inflation expectations have stayed anchored
despite recent rises in inflation (see Online Annex 2.2).
Although reassuring, this anchoring of long-term
expectations should not be taken for granted—it likely
reflects in part the active response of policymakers to
dampen price pressures.

History Suggests It Can Take Time for Inflation and
Near-Term Expectations to Come Down
Long-term inflation expectations have remained
stable, but how unusual are the current paths of other
major macroeconomic variables? To put it into historical context, the chapter compares the recent experience
with that observed after historical episodes in which
near- and long-term inflation expectations were rising
for at least a year (Figure 2.4).
Current paths for actual inflation are so far in line
with historical medians, whereas near-term inflation
expectations displayed a sharper increase and a faster
decline compared with those in previous episodes.
After inflation expectations persistently rose over a
year, economies subsequently tended to see a gradual
but slow decline in headline inflation and near-term
inflation expectations. Both typically take about three
years to revert to their pre-episode levels, although
core inflation remained stickier. However, there is a
large variability across experiences, as observed in the
interquartile ranges.

After past episodes in which inﬂation expectations rose persistently for a year or
more, it took about three years on average for inﬂation and near-term expectations
to come back down to pre-episode levels. Compared with those in these historical
episodes, recent long-term inﬂation expectations have been unusually stable and
real policy rate paths sharper across economy groups.

Managing Expectations: Inflation and Monetary Policy

In contrast, recent paths for real policy rates and
long-term inflation expectations appear different than
the median paths in past episodes. On the one hand,
real policy rates in 2022 were well below those in
the comparative paths of earlier episodes, partly on
account of the sharp and large rise in inflation. On the
other hand, real rates are now well above the historical
median, with the difference reflecting rapid monetary
tightening and the latest falls in headline inflation.
Unlike those in earlier episodes, long-term inflation
expectations have been unusually stable coming into
the recent high inflation regime. This is consistent
with and supports the chapter’s findings on the recent
stability and (so far) solid anchoring of long-term
expectations.

The Role of Expectations in Inflation Dynamics

Professional forecasters LT

To provide a better understanding of the role of
expectations in inflation dynamics, this section considers a hybrid price Phillips curve framework that
relates current inflation to a set of drivers, including
inflation expectations, lagged inflation, and the output gap.10 The section first assesses the explanatory
power of different agents’ expectations for inflation
and the relative importance of near- versus long-term
expectations. Second, an instrumental variables
approach is used to identify the causal impact of
inflation expectations on inflation. Third, using the
causal estimates, the section shows the contributions
of different drivers to recent inflation dynamics for
average advanced and emerging market economies.
Finally, the section explores whether the effect of
expectations on inflation changes with the prevailing
level of inflation.11

10See Chapter 3 of the October 2018 World Economic Outlook
(WEO), Chapter 2 of the October 2021 WEO, and Chapter 2
of the October 2022 WEO for recent analyses looking at
cross-economy estimates of Phillips curves (for prices and
wages). Dao and others (2023) use a similar approach to analyze
inflation developments in the United States and the euro area.
See Online Annex 2.4 for further details on the estimation
and analysis.
11Other potential important dimensions in modeling the Phillips
curve relationship, such as time-varying coefficients, nonlinearities,
structural breaks, and the influence of higher-order moments of
measured expectations, as well as alternative measures of slack, are
left for future work.

Near-term measures of inﬂation expectations can better predict current inﬂation
than longer-term measures. Expectations of ﬁrms, ﬁnancial markets, and

Near-Term Expectations Matter Most for Inflation
When considered one by one, alternative measures of
inflation expectations (by agents or horizons) show different abilities to explain inflation when the hybrid Phillips
curve model is used (Figure 2.5). The coefficient estimates represent the change in inflation associated with a
one standard deviation increase in the indicated measure
of expectations.12 The first finding is that long-term
inflation expectations have lower predictive power than
near-term measures. Both financial-market-based and
professional forecasters’ five-year-ahead inflation expectations have smaller standardized coefficients than other
measures (Figure 2.5, bottom two sets of boxes and whiskers). These results are consistent with those of recent
12The coefficients are standardized to account for the volatility of
different measures and to allow a comparison of inflation forecasts
with the new index of firms’ inflation expectations, which is based
on a different scale. Because of lack of data availability, this comparison can be undertaken for the United Kingdom, the United States,
and the euro area.

but not different from zero with statistical significance),
whereas in emerging market economies, the carryover

gap has a statistically significant relationship with current inflation for both economy groups but is somewhat
larger for the group of emerging market economies.

work that finds a small role for long-term expectations
on current inflation (Werning 2022; Hajdini 2023). Second, there is remarkable consistency across professional
forecasters’, financial markets’, and firms’ near-term inflation expectations (Figure 2.5, top three boxes and whiskers). These results imply that a one-standard-deviation
increase in expectations is associated with a 0.7 standard
deviation increase in current inflation.13 Finally, the
coefficient for households’ near-term expectations falls
somewhere between those for near- and long-term expectations of other agents.
In light of these findings and crucially because of
broader economy and time coverage, the baseline specification of the hybrid Phillips curve is estimated using
near-term inflation expectations from professional forecasters (Figure 2.6). The estimated relationship suggests
that a 1 percentage point rise in near-term expectations
is associated with a 1.1 percentage point rise in current inflation among advanced economies, whereas
for emerging market economies, the rise is about
13Coefficients for inflation expectations unadjusted for volatility
range from 1.1 to 1.4. The estimated coefficients for long-term
expectations are lower than those for near-term expectations. Excluding the post-2019 period results in lower estimated coefficients, but
similar patterns.

International Monetary Fund | October 2023

The previous results document statistical associations between current inflation and near-term inflation
expectations—they do not account for the possibility
that current inflation could drive expectations of future
inflation or that omitted factors could be driving both.
To address these shortcomings and estimate the causal
effect of expectations on inflation (the expectations
channel), an instrumental variables strategy based on
lags of near-term inflation expectations and the output
gap is used to reestimate the hybrid Phillips curve. The
strategy leverages the facts that these variables display
serial correlation over time (current values are strongly
related to their past values) and that lags of these variables do not directly affect current inflation under the
hybrid Phillips curve specification.15
14Chapter 3 of the October 2016 World Economic Outlook (WEO)
and Chapter 2 of the October 2016 and October 2021 WEO,
respectively, as well as Kamber, Mohanty, and Morley (2020), also
find higher coefficients for lagged inflation in hybrid Phillips curves
in emerging market economies compared with those in advanced
economies. Forbes, Gagnon, and Collins (2021) demonstrate that
the coefficients on lagged inflation decrease when panel estimates
include only advanced economies. These studies do not explore
potential causes, but the higher prevalence of price indexation in
many emerging market economies may account for these findings
(Céspedes and others 2005; Frankel 2010; Kganyago 2023). In
addition, weaker monetary policy frameworks, on average, could also
contribute to the smaller relative role of expectations. It might also
be rational for adaptive learners to rely more on past inflation when
indexation is more prevalent and the credibility of policymaking
institutions is lower. Improvements in monetary policy frameworks
and communications in emerging market economies over the past
15 years (see Box 2.2) suggest that lagged inflation could play a
reduced role in these economies’ inflation dynamics going forward.
Finally, emerging market economies might suffer from larger measurement error on inflation expectations, which would lead to an
attenuation bias and a relatively more important estimated role for
lagged inflation.
15See Online Annex 2.4 for further details on the model specification, instrumental variables strategy, its performance and key results,
and robustness checks. The instrumental variables estimates are stable
across time periods.

Note: The ﬁgure shows coefﬁcients from linear regressions estimated by pooled

the 90 percent conﬁdence interval around the estimated coefﬁcient. The
dependent variable is quarterly headline inﬂation, seasonally adjusted at an
annualized rate. Associational estimates are computed by ordinary least squares,
while causal estimates are computed using an instrumental variables approach.
Models include economy and time ﬁxed effects along with additional control
variables. See Online Annex 2.4 for further details on the speciﬁcation and
instrumental variables strategy.

The causal estimates of the effects of near-term
expectations on current inflation are about 30 percent lower in magnitude than the associational
estimates (Figure 2.7). This implies that some
of the observed variation in near-term inflation
expectations reflects reverse causation (that is,
higher current inflation drives up expectations of
future inflation) or omitted factors that affect both
current inflation and expectations. By removing
these biases, the instrumental variables estimates
provide a more accurate assessment of the expectations channel. For the average advanced economy,
inflation would rise by about 0.8 percentage point
for a 1 percentage point rise in near-term expectations. The pass-through estimate for the average
emerging market economy is about 0.4 percentage
point. The difference in magnitudes, combined with
differences in the relationship of current inflation to
past inflation, suggests that expectations formation
in emerging market economies on average tends to
be more backward looking than what is observed in
advanced economies.

Expectations Explain an Increasing Share of Recent
Inflation Dynamics
The contribution to recent inflation dynamics of the
expectations channel can be calculated using the causal
estimates of the hybrid Phillips curve (Figure 2.8).
For the average advanced economy, factors other
than expectations and lagged inflation initially drove
most of the increase in inflation that took place over
2021–22 (Figure 2.8, panel 1). These include common
global factors, such as the economic disruptions caused
by the COVID-19 shock, large swings in commodity prices, and global supply chain issues, as well as
the economy-specific effects of energy prices and the

output gap (which may in turn reflect domestic aggregate demand measures). Even so, Figure 2.8 reveals a
large and growing role for near-term inflation expectations in explaining inflation dynamics in the most
recent quarters.16 In contrast, lagged inflation had a
small role.
Turning to the average emerging market economy,
once again factors other than expectations and lagged
inflation were responsible for the peak in inflation in
2022 (Figure 2.8, panel 2). On average, expectations
have played a significant but smaller role in accounting
for headline inflation than among advanced economies. On the other hand, lagged inflation explained
almost half of the average rise in inflation since the
first quarter of 2020.

Expectations to Inﬂation

The final exercise in the section consists of estimating whether the pass-through from inflation
expectations to current inflation varies by the level
of inflation: Are there signs of a nonlinearity or state
dependence in the effect of expectations on inflation?
In both advanced and emerging market economies,
the estimated pass-through is higher when inflation is
elevated (above its economy-specific sample median;
Figure 2.9). The difference is particularly large, with
the coefficient increasing from 0.6 when inflation is
low (below its economy-specific sample median) to
0.9 when inflation is high and statistically significant
for advanced economies. These results imply that the
expectations channel may be even more important in
accounting for inflation dynamics at present, while
inflation remains high.

Expectations Formation and Monetary
Policymaking
This section explores the question of how inflation expectations affect monetary policy effectiveness
and how different policies can affect expectations.
It uses a semistructural model to illustrate how the
expectations formation processes in an economy
16Other factors have remained relevant in recent quarters despite
a net contribution approaching zero, as shown by the gray bars in
Figure 2.8, panel 1. This is because the pass-through from lower
energy prices has been offset by other factors, mainly captured by
quarterly fixed effects.

interact with monetary policy actions, affecting
the dynamics of inflation, expectations, and economic activity.
The analysis extends the standard dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with expectational
learning by Alvarez and Dizioli (2023). The model
includes price and wage Phillips curves (relating
price and wage inflation to expectations, the gap
between real wages and productivity, and economic
slack), an IS curve (relating output to the nominal interest rate and inflation expectations), and
a monetary policy reaction function.17 Two new
features are incorporated into the model. First,
heterogenous agents or a mix of backward- and
forward-looking learners with different information
sets are added. Backward-looking learners form
their expectations based on their recent experience,
whereas forward-looking learners form their expectations rationally based on full information about the

structure, and its estimation.

CHAPTER 2

economy, including the share of backward-looking
learners. This means that forward-looking learners
will behave more like backward-looking learners
as the share of backward-looking learners rises in
the economy.18 Second, as inspired by Blanchard and
Bernanke (2023), near-term expectations are influenced by long-term expectations and vice versa. The
main additional assumption is that long-term expectations have an impact on inflation only through
their effect on near-term expectations. An alternative
model allowing only forward-looking learners is
also considered for comparison. The two models—
heterogenous expectations and forward-looking
learners or rational expectations only—are estimated for two representative economies (advanced
and emerging market) to help capture the structural differences between the two economy groups.
With heterogenous agents, the estimated shares of
backward-looking learners are about 20 percent for
the advanced economy and about 30 percent for the
emerging market economy, with the remainder being
forward-looking learners.

More Backward-Looking Learners Prolong Inflation and
Weaken Monetary Policy Transmission
The propagation of shocks to the economy depends
upon how expectations are formed. Following an
identical cost-push shock (for example, a surprise
rise in energy and commodity prices, an unanticipated supply chain disruption raising input costs,
or other supply-side shocks), inflation is persistently
higher when there are heterogenous agents in the
economy, as compared with an economy that has
only forward-looking learners. With a share of
backward-looking learners in the economy, inflation
expectations respond more to a cost-push shock and
are stickier. Backward-looking learners assume that
higher current inflation means that future inflation
will be persistently higher. This prolongs the price
pressures compared with those in the economy
with forward-looking learners who know that the
cost-push shock is transitory and do not change
their inflation expectations much (Figure 2.10,
18Other

expectations formation processes are possible (for example, completely anchored, unresponsive inflation expectations). The
chapter does not aim to be exhaustive. It illustrates instead how a
plausible mix of two highly relevant kinds of processes may affect
developments.

Managing Expectations: Inflation and Monetary Policy

panels 1–4). Moreover, with heterogenous agents,
monetary policy has less power initially to influence
inflation (Figure 2.10, panels 5–8). The main reason
is that backward-looking learners do not consider
the impact of monetary policy on future marginal
costs, unlike forward-looking learners. Without this
forward-looking component, monetary policy can
influence expectations only through its direct effects
on the output gap.

Higher Sacrifice Ratio with More Backward-Looking
Learners or Higher Inflation
The combination of more prolonged inflationary
episodes following a cost-push shock and less powerful monetary policy implies that achieving a given
level of inflation reduction over a given period will
be more costly in terms of output forgone. This will
be reflected in the level of the sacrifice ratio, defined
here as the percentage of output forgone to achieve
a 1 percentage point faster reduction in the inflation
rate over a three-year period (Figure 2.11).19 First,
the sacrifice ratio is larger in the heterogeneous
agents’ model than in the rational expectations
model with only forward-looking learners (regardless
of the economy group). The main reason for this
increased sacrifice ratio is the weaker inflation expectations channel for monetary policy when there are
more backward-looking learners in the economy.
Second, the sacrifice ratio also tends to be higher
for an emerging market than an advanced economy,
as the former is estimated to have a higher share
of backward-looking learners. Third, when there
are heterogenous agents, the economy’s dynamics
become state dependent. In a high-inflation environment, backward-looking learners behave as though
inflation will be permanently higher, entailing
a slight endogenous inflation de-anchoring and
making monetary policy’s job harder (Figure 2.11,
rightmost bars).20

19Tetlow (2022) reports a wide range of sacrifice ratio estimates
for advanced economies, with a mode of seven (similar to that
presented here) across 40 different models and slightly different
definitions. That said, the chapter’s focus is on the qualitative comparison across cases.
20To get closer to current conditions, a high-inflation environment
is simulated by running the model for eight periods, with inflation
2 percentage points above target, to establish the initial conditions
for the scenario.

Following a cost-push shock, inﬂation expectations are more sensitive when the economy has a mix of forward- and backward-looking learners (heterogenous
expectations) than when it has only forward-looking learners (rational expectations). Inﬂation is also more persistent. Monetary policy is less effective, as
backward-looking learners do not take account of the effects of interest rate rises on future marginal costs.

Note: Numbers on the horizontal axes in the panels represent quarters after the shock at time 0. Panels 1–4 show the impulse responses to a cost-push shock that
increases inﬂation by 1 percentage point. Note that the output gap increases after this shock, because potential output falls by more than real GDP. Panels 5–8 show
the impulse responses to a temporary monetary policy shock that increases the policy rate by 100 basis points. Note that the monetary policy shock’s impact on
inﬂation peaks after ﬁve quarters in the heterogenous-expectations model and after three quarters in the rational-expectations model.

Monetary Policy Framework and Communications
Improvements Ease Disinflation
The estimated model offers a laboratory for considering how alternative policy interventions help hasten
a decline in inflation. The first intervention examined
is one that would lead to an increase in the share of
forward-looking learners in the economy.21 How might
such a shift be achieved?
21Several studies over the past several years indicate that most individuals do not understand the central bank’s role in the economy and how
policy rate changes affect the economy, suggesting that their expectations
may be distorted. See, among others, Coibion, Gorodnichenko, and
Weber (2022), ECB (2021), Kumar and others (2015), and van der
Cruijsen, Jansen, and de Haan (2015). Andre and others (2022) find that
over a sample of 6,500 US households, households on average believe
that a rise in a central bank’s policy interest rate would increase inflation.

60

International Monetary Fund | October 2023

Recent studies suggest that improvements in monetary policy frameworks—encompassing central banks’
independence and transparency and their communications strategies—can increase agents’ attention to
and understanding of monetary policy actions, helping
to make inflation expectations more forward looking
(Coibion and others 2020; Carotta, Mello, and Ponce
2023). Brazil’s recent decision to adopt a continuous
(rather than calendar year) 3 percent inflation rate target
from 2025 onward is a concrete example of an improvement in operational effectiveness and communications
strategy, helping to reduce uncertainty and enhance
monetary policy effectiveness. Additional examples of
improvements in communications strategies include
actions since 2020 by the central banks of Pakistan

Processes
(Percent of output forgone to lower inﬂation by 1 percentage point)

Sacriﬁce ratios are larger when economies include a mix of forward- and
backward-looking learners (heterogenous expectations), as monetary policy is less
effective in that case. Emerging market economies tend to have higher shares of
backward-looking learners, pushing up their ratios. Higher prevailing inﬂation
slightly worsens the ratio, as backward-looking learners raise their expectations.

of improvements in operational effectiveness include
decisions since 2019 by the central banks of Chile
and Thailand to state their primary policy objective as
price stability, with clearly defined numerical targets.
Through the lens of the model, the chapter quantifies
the potential effects of such interventions in a stylized,
illustrative manner.
Moreover, an association exists between the qualities
of the monetary policy framework in an economy and
the likelihood that a simple forecast rationality test of
mean inflation expectations is rejected (Figure 2.12; see
also Online Annex 2.5). When monetary policy frameworks are weaker (in terms of central bank independence, transparency, and communications), the share
of economies in which forecast rationality of expectations is rejected tends to be higher, consistent with
a greater incidence of backward-looking learners.22

Further bolstering the evidence on the importance of
the soundness of monetary policy frameworks, a negative association exists between the size of deviations of
near-term inflation expectations (or realized inflation
rates) from targets and the quality of monetary policy
frameworks. As monetary policy frameworks improve,
the deviations from target are smaller, implying that
inflation comes back to target more quickly, on average
(see Online Annex 2.7).
Although there has been a notable trend toward
improving frameworks in emerging market and developing economies (Box 2.2), the quality of monetary policy
frameworks and communications is higher, on average,

developing economies. As such, the analysis of the
policy intervention considers a decline in the share of
backward-looking learners in the economy equal to
the difference between the share of backward-looking
learners in the representative emerging market versus
that in the representative advanced economy.23 With
a higher share of forward-looking learners, the same
monetary policy tightening path as under the baseline
would have stronger effects on inflation expectations
(Figure 2.13, panels 1, 3, and 5). Monetary policy is
more effective not only because forward-looking learners
understand the impacts on future marginal costs, but
also because they know that that there is a lower share
of backward-looking learners in the economy and hence
become even more forward looking. These results are
consistent with findings highlighted in Box 2.1, in
which US monetary policy is found to be more effective
in shaping expectations when firms are more attentive to
monetary policy than the average firm in the sector and
therefore are more forward looking. The faster transmission to inflation expectations translates into a lower
realized inflation path and importantly a softer landing,
with only small additional output costs.
In contrast, even tighter cyclical policies (either
monetary or fiscal) as additional interventions also help
dampen inflation and expectations, but come with
larger output costs (Figure 2.13, panels 2, 4, and 6).
While the two cyclical policy interventions are not
strictly comparable, they both work in part through
generating lower aggregate demand initially.24 Over
time, then, the inflation-lowering effects of tightening feed into inflation expectations, further lowering
realized inflation.
Although an improvement in monetary policy
framework and communications comes with markedly lower output costs due to its primary impacts
on expectations and their formation, difficulties in
implementing these interventions in a timely and effective manner mean that they are not silver bullets and
should be seen as complementary to usual monetary
policy actions.

23The difference in the share of backward-looking learners is
about 8 percent.
24Specifically, the illustration assumes standard unit policy interventions on impact, with policy persistence properties that differ
across the fiscal and monetary interventions, as described in the note
to Figure 2.13. Learning dynamics in the model also imply that the
evolution of the system can depend on the specific properties of the
intervention, as well as the prevailing context. See Online Annex 2.5
for further details.

trade-off between lowering inﬂation and fostering growth through their effects on

higher output cost.

The “Monetary policy framework and communications strategy improvements”

advanced versus the emerging market economy models. The “Fiscal
consolidation” intervention assumes that ﬁscal spending is cut by 1 percent of
GDP for two years and monetary policy does not try to offset the effects of the
ﬁscal efforts. The “Monetary tightening” intervention assumes an initial 100 basis

Moreover, the role of fiscal policy for inflation and
inflation expectations is likely more complex than
what can be captured by the illustrative model here. As
shown in the empirical analysis in Box 2.2, worse fiscal
positions (that is, higher public debt and persistent
deficits) can reduce the effectiveness of sounder monetary policy frameworks in lowering inflation expectations in emerging market and developing economies.
In other words, more sustainable fiscal positions are
associated with lower average inflation expectations.
Even so, there may be conditions under which fiscal
support measures may help to lower inflation or at
least smooth out a sharp inflationary shock, as seen
in Box 2.3’s analysis of the fiscal relief measures to
offset the energy shock in Europe in 2022. Consumers’
perceived or expected persistence of these measures is
critical to how they affect the path of inflation.

Managing Expectations: Inflation and Monetary Policy

Figure 2.14. Policy Objectives, Social Welfare, and
Expectations Formation
After a cost-push shock, the time it takes inﬂation to get back to target in an
economy depends on the formation of expectations and the central bank’s
objectives. A greater share of backward-looking learners in the economy draws
out the timeline, regardless of policy objectives. A comparison with a stylized
social welfare function suggests that a faster path may come with costs unless
driven by less persistent shocks.

Monetary Policy Faces Inflation-Output Trade-Offs
In the current context in which core inflation
in many countries is more persistent than initially
expected, an important question policymakers face is
the timeline for bringing inflation back to target. This
subsection illustrates how a central bank’s optimal
choice, one that minimizes a stylized welfare loss
function, would vary with its objectives and the properties of the underlying shocks in the context of the
illustrative model. The baseline case assumes that the
central bank seeks to minimize a function that equally
weights the welfare losses from the output gap and
inflation target deviations, alongside a smoother policy
rate path.25 In the heterogeneous agents’ model, the
central bank under the baseline would opt to calibrate
the policy rate path to bring inflation back to target in
about four years (Figure 2.14, panel 1).26 If the central
bank were to accelerate this process and decided to
double the weight of inflation in its objective function,
then it would aim for inflation to come back to target
in about three years. In a more extreme case in which
25Specifically, the exercise assumes that the central bank minimizes
a welfare loss function that values interest rate smoothing and
equally weights output and inflation deviations (a quadratic loss
function). The central bank is also assumed to know the expectations
formation process in the economy and to have full information on
the path of future cost-push shocks. See Online Annex 2.7 for more
details on the exercise.
26Since shock persistence is highly uncertain, this subsection
presents two scenarios assuming different degrees of persistence.
If the shock turns out to be less persistent, monetary policy will
be able to bring inflation back to target in less than four years
(Figure 2.14, panel 2).

Note: The ﬁgure assumes that a cost-push shock raises inﬂation 2 percentage

measured by a stylized social welfare function. The latter includes an interest rate
smoothing term and weighs output gap and inﬂation deviations equally. Panel 2
welfare baselines differ by the expectations formation process. For an identical
welfare function, social welfare is about 20 percent higher with rational than with
heterogenous expectations, reﬂecting enhanced policy effectiveness and lower
endogenous persistence of shocks. See Online Annex 2.5 for further details on the
assumed objective and social welfare functions and other aspects of the dynamic
stochastic general equilibrium model. The “Less persistent shock” scenario
reduces the half-life of the shock to 6.5 quarters.

the central bank cares only about inflation, it would
choose to bring inflation back to target in two years.
However, this latter choice entails lower welfare if
society in fact values equally both minimal output gaps
and inflation target deviations (Figure 2.14, panel 2).27
27The welfare losses clearly depend on the weights that each society would put on inflation target and output gap deviations.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Navigating Global Divergences

Finally, if there were only forward-looking learners in
the economy, then it would be optimal to bring inflation back to target in about three years. Overall, even
if the cost-push shock were half as persistent as under
the baseline assumptions, it would still be optimal to
wait about two years to bring inflation back to target.
All these scenarios show that in the presence of a persistent cost-push shock and partially backward-looking
expectations, it may be optimal to use a more extended
timeline over which inflation is brought to target.

Conclusions
Near-term inflation expectations rose sharply in
many economies amid the economic recovery from the
pandemic and after the large cost-push shocks of 2022
(from the surprise rises in energy and commodity prices
and supply chain disruptions). The rise in expectations
was broadly synchronous across professional forecasters,
financial markets, households, and firms. In contrast,
long-term expectations have remained broadly stable,
on average, with no signs of de-anchoring. Past episodes
with jointly rising near- and long-term inflation expectations over a sustained period indicate it took about three
years on average for inflation and near-term expectations
to return to pre-episode levels, although there has been
wide variability across episodes.
An estimated hybrid Phillips curve suggests
that near-term inflation expectations play a more
prominent role in explaining current inflation than
long-term expectations. Over recent quarters, the drivers of inflation have shifted from underlying cost-push
shocks toward inflation expectations, particularly
for the average advanced economy. For the average
emerging market economy, expectations play a smaller
role than lagged inflation, but still a significant one.
This is particularly relevant because the pass-through
of expectations to inflation increases when inflation is
already elevated, as it is in the present time.
More generally, the analysis underlines the critical
role of the expectations formation process for inflation
dynamics and the conduct of monetary policy. With
a larger share of backward-looking learners in the economy, mean expectations are more persistent and can
get stuck at a higher level when inflation is higher for
a sustained period. This stickiness reduces the potency
of monetary policy and increases the sacrifice ratio (or
cost in terms of output forgone) compared with a case
in which expectations are purely forward looking.
Given the greater inflation persistence implied by
having a share of backward-looking learners in the
64

International Monetary Fund | October 2023

economy, it could take up to four years to get inflation
back to its target if central banks equally weigh the
welfare losses from inflation deviating from target with
those from output gaps. If central banks were to disregard the output gap effects of their actions and tighten
more and faster, the analysis suggests they could bring
inflation back to target in two years, but at the cost of
lower output.
Taken together, the chapter’s results and recent
findings suggest that monetary policymakers benefit
from having a clear understanding of the nature of
expectations processes at play in their economies.
Improved data on expectations could involve close
monitoring and enhanced collection of information
on expectations across economic agents, particularly
near-term expectations which appear more important
for current inflation dynamics. The performance of a
novel measure of firms’ inflation expectations derived
from text analysis of firms’ earnings calls presented in
this chapter points to how technological developments
have made it more feasible and cost-effective to extract
timely information on expectations.
Improvements to monetary policy frameworks—
particularly those that enhance central bank independence and transparency—and communication strategies
have the scope to boost the share of forward-looking
learners in the economy and thereby the effectiveness
of monetary policy (Dincer, Eichengreen, and Geraats
2022). Recent literature suggests that exposure to news
improves the precision of perceptions and expectations,
increases confidence, and lowers dispersion of beliefs
(Lamla and Vinogradov 2019). Haldane, Macaulay, and
McMahon (2020) recommend that central bank communications strategies should start with the three Es:
explanation, engagement, and education. Focusing on
household and firms, other recent contributions suggest
addressing inattention by taking account of audience
segmentation and using sources of communication
that have been identified as most relevant for people
with more backward-looking expectations—for example, television in the United States and euro area (see
Coibion and others 2020, D’Acunto and others 2020,
and Weber and others 2022, among others). They also
suggest shaping messages that are simple and repeated
often, investing in financial literacy education, emphasizing the goal and not the instruments (for example,
former European Central Bank President Mario Draghi’s
2012 “whatever it takes” speech), and targeting the message to the conjuncture. These communication strategies
can help economic agents become aware of, understand,
and internalize the effects of monetary policy decisions.

CHAPTER 2

Managing Expectations: Inflation and Monetary Policy

Box 2.1. Firms’ Inflation Expectations, Attention, and Monetary Policy Effectiveness
The inflation expectations channel can improve when
firms pay greater attention to monetary policy and
develop a stronger understanding of what it means for
their business prospects. However, surveys of firms’ inflation expectations are scarce and time consuming to implement (Coibion and others 2020). This box introduces a
new firm-level index of near-term inflation expectations
based on text analysis of firms’ earnings calls and presents
preliminary findings on how firms’ attention to inflation
can influence the effectiveness of monetary policy.
An index of firms’ attention to monetary policy is
built in this box using a text analysis of firms’ earnings
calls. Details of its construction feature in Albrizio,
Dizioli, and Simon (2023) and are similar to those
for the firm-level index of inflation expectations, as
described in Online Annex 2.6. Specifically, an index
for US firms’ attention to the Federal Reserve is constructed based on the frequency of sentences discussing
monetary policy in their earnings call transcripts (see
Figure 2.1.1 for an aggregate picture).
Dynamic responses are estimated using local projections to assess the effect of a monetary policy shock
on a firm’s inflation expectations, conditional on the
firm’s attentiveness to monetary policy.1 Attentiveness
by firm is de-meaned by sectoral average attentiveness
in the regression. Because of the de-meaning and
the inclusion of time fixed effects, the interaction
between the monetary policy shock and attention
reflects the marginal effect of monetary tightening
on a firm’s inflation expectations from its being more
attentive. More attentive firms decrease their inflation expectations by about 1 percent of one standard
deviation more than the average after four quarters
(Figure 2.1.2).2 This corresponds to an amplification
of about one-fourth to the sector’s average negative
response. The results bolster the chapter’s argument
that monetary policy is more effective when monetary
policy frameworks and communication strategies help
improve agents’ trust in central banks and their understanding of central banks’ monetary policy decisions.
The authors of this box are Silvia Albrizio, Pedro Vitale
Simon, and Allan Dizioli.

index, firm and time fixed effects, and firm-level controls, based
on Ottonello and Windberry (2020). Firm-level controls include
sales growth, leverage, employment, total assets, and share of current assets in total assets. Standard errors are two-way clustered
by firms and time.

In the study presented in this box, the soundness
of monetary policy frameworks is captured by a
new index, the IAPOC index, developed by Unsal,
Papageorgiou, and Garbers (2022).2 It shows that even
after economy-specific controls and time-invariant
characteristics are accounted for, higher public debt
is associated with expectations of higher inflation,
given a specific level of monetary policy framework
(Figure 2.2.1, panel 1).3 This heightened impact is
even more evident when the focus is on the stock of
public debt in foreign currency and exacerbated when
fiscal deficits are persistent (Figure 2.2.1, panel 2).
However, as monetary policy frameworks are improved
(as seen with the shift in the IAPOC index distribution in emerging market and developing economies
over the past 15 years), inflation expectations become
less sensitive to the level and composition of public
debt or persistent fiscal deficits.
Overall, the study findings indicate that difficulties
posed by higher public debt levels for managing inflation expectations in emerging market and developing
economies could be eased by adopting strong monetary
policy frameworks. Whereas monetary policymaking

Fiscal imprudence—high levels of public debt to GDP—
is generally regarded as having the potential to generate
uncertainty and influence inflation expectations by
eroding perceptions of monetary policy credibility and
independence.1 That much has been clear since the work
of Sargent and Wallace (1981) and Leeper (1991).
This box empirically examines how the level of inflation
expectations is related to an economy’s monetary policy
framework, given the level of public debt.

effective preparation for challenges and to prevent the
risk of fiscal dominance in the future.

Managing Expectations: Inflation and Monetary Policy

Box 2.3. Energy Subsidies, Inflation, and Expectations: Unpacking Euro Area Measures
Several European economies have used energy subsidies,
tax cuts, and price caps to help smooth the impact of
recent shocks to energy prices on incomes and inflation.
The effectiveness and desirability of such measures depends
on many factors beyond the scope of this box, including
their impact on energy markets, resource misallocation,
and fiscal sustainability, as well as details of the policy
design. One important channel is inflation expectations.
Temporary energy subsidies directly lower inflation today
but increase it relative to the no-measures scenario after
they expire, smoothing the overall inflation path. If energy
subsidies are perceived as temporary, the expectations
channel may reduce their effectiveness in lowering inflation, as expectations of higher future inflation may affect
price-setting today.
A model from the IMF’s Flexible System of Global
Models is used in this box to simulate the impacts on
expected and realized inflation of announced energy
relief measures (price subsidies and caps) in the euro
area.1 The simulation assumes that the sharp upward
shock to energy prices in 2022 is temporary and
unwinds. It also includes the indirect effects of energy
prices on core inflation through the supply chain. The
model estimates that fiscal relief measures lowered
euro area inflation by 0.9 percentage point in 2022
and by half a percentage point in 2023 (Figure 2.3.1,
panel 1). Although additional fiscal borrowing to
finance subsidies boosts demand, its effect on core
inflation is more than offset by the reduction in
supply-chain costs. These fiscal measures smooth out
the inflation impact of the energy shock over time,
leading to a rise in inflation over 2024–25 (relative to
the no-measures scenario) and preventing an undershoot as energy subsidies expire and the energy shock
unwinds. The measures have a net neutral effect on
core inflation expectations in 2022 but increase them
by 0.7 percentage point over 2023–24. These findings assume, however, that agents fully understand
the temporary nature of the subsidies. What if agents
misperceive and think that the subsidies will last
for a year more than announced? In this alternative
scenario, expectations fall more in 2022 (Figure 2.3.1,
panel 2). Subsidies also lead firms to lower their

FRAGMENTATION AND COMMODITY MARKETS:
VULNERABILITIES AND RISKS

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 caused major commodity markets to fragment, and continued geopolitical
tensions could make matters worse. This chapter examines
the key channels through which further disruptions in
commodity trade could affect prices, economic activity,
and the clean energy transition. It finds that commodity markets are particularly vulnerable in the event of
fragmentation. Commodity production is often highly
concentrated because of natural endowments, and many
commodities are difficult to substitute in the short term.
Further fragmentation of commodity markets—which had
been on the rise even before the war in Ukraine—could
cause large price changes and more price volatility. Model
simulations suggest that trade disruptions could result in
substantial economic impacts in commodity-dependent
economies. However, due to offsetting effects across producing and consuming countries, global economic costs appear
modest. Crucially, low-income countries with a high reliance on agricultural imports would be disproportionately
affected, raising food security concerns. The fragmentation
of mineral markets could also make the clean energy
transition more costly and lead to lower-than-needed
investment in renewable energy and electric vehicles.
Taken together, the findings present yet another argument
for multilateral cooperation on trade policies. At the
very least, agreements on a “green corridor” for critical
minerals and a “food corridor” would safeguard the global
goals of averting climate change and food insecurity.

Introduction
Since the end of the Cold War, primary commodity markets have become more integrated as a result
of trade liberalization, technological innovation,
The authors of this chapter are Jorge Alvarez (co–team lead), Mehdi

Petia Topalova. Yarou Xu, Carlos Morales, and Canran Zheng provided

Survey for guidance on data.

and declines in transportation costs. Integrated
commodity markets have provided cheap inputs
that have supported global growth and so have
helped raise living standards, especially in emerging markets.1
However, the war in Ukraine put this process in
reverse. For the first time since the 1970s, commodities
such as crude oil, natural gas, and wheat were broadly
used to exert pressure in a major conflict. Exports
were restricted and countersanctions imposed. These
disruptions in commodity trade contributed to surging
inflation in 2022 in many parts of the world, food
insecurity in low-income countries, and slower global
growth (IMF 2023).
While most commodity prices have since normalized, geopolitical tensions signal that more severe
fragmentation of commodity trade is a major risk.2
Many countries are trying to reshore commodity supply chains for national security, geopolitical, or other
reasons. Measures include those for critical minerals
for clean energy technologies, semiconductors, and
defense (examples of actions are the US Inflation
Reduction Act, the European Chips Act, and China’s
export restrictions on gallium and germanium).
As a result, concerns about fragmentation, deglobalization, and nearshoring have risen sharply, especially
in the commodity sector (Figure 3.1). Text mining
analysis of earnings calls reveals that prior to the
COVID-19 pandemic, firms barely mentioned keywords related to fragmentation, but usage surged after
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

1Economic theory suggests that the consumption gains and the
more efficient use of resources generated by trade should boost GDP.
See Feyrer (2019, 2021) for recent analysis and Irwin (2019) for a
review of the literature on trade and growth.
2Building on Aiyar and others (2023), the chapter defines geoeconomic fragmentation (referred to as “fragmentation” for brevity
in the rest of the chapter) as any policy-driven reversal of integration, including reversals guided by strategic considerations such as
national security. It encompasses trade, fiscal and financial measures
such as tariffs, export restrictions, subsidies, and restrictions on
payments. The trade literature of the early 2000s used “fragmentation” to describe the geographic dispersion of production processes
in globally integrated supply chains (Arndt and Kierzkowski 2000;
Deardorff 2001).

Note: Fragmentation indices measure the average number of sentences, per
thousand earnings calls, that mention at least one of the following keywords:
deglobalization, reshoring, onshoring, nearshoring, friend-shoring, localization,
regionalization.

There is little consensus on the economic costs of
fragmentation in the fast-growing literature. Estimates of long-term output losses from restricting
the international flow of goods and services, finance,
and technology range from 0.2 percent to 12 percent of global GDP, depending on the scenario and
assumptions.3 Commodity markets could be another
important channel through which further disruptions
in trade affect activity. Commodity production is hard
to relocate, as it is linked to natural endowments such
as geological deposits or soil quality. Consumption of
commodities is often difficult to substitute in the short
term. Moreover, many commodities are crucial inputs
for manufacturing and technologies, including those
related to the clean energy transition.
Against this backdrop, the chapter studies the
main channels through which further fragmentation

of impact. Recent studies that quantify aggregate losses from restricting
trade include Albrizio and others (2023); Attinasi, Boeckelmann, and

of markets for energy, agricultural, and mineral
­commodities could affect economies and global public
goods—namely, the energy transition. It focuses on the
following questions:
•• What makes commodity markets vulnerable in the
event of fragmentation?
•• Is there fragmentation in commodity markets, and if
so, what form does it take?
•• Which commodities are most vulnerable to disruptions in international trade?
•• What would be the economic impact of commodity
market fragmentation across blocs and countries, as
well as on the global economy?
•• What might be the implications of such fragmentation for the clean energy transition?
The chapter covers nearly all countries and focuses
on 48 commodities, including agricultural goods,
energy commodities—namely, coal, crude oil, and
natural gas—and other mineral commodities. It
builds a unique database of commodity output, use,
and bilateral trade, and employs a combination of
descriptive statistics, empirical analysis, and model
simulations.
The chapter simulates a highly stylized risk scenario,
in which commodity trade between two geopolitical
blocs is persistently disrupted, to illustrate the channels through which commodity market fragmentation
could affect prices and output. The main scenario
defines the two theoretical blocs by using the 2022
United Nations (UN) vote on the war in Ukraine as a
transparent starting point. However, the chapter examines alternative scenarios, including the role of neutral
countries and the impact of countries’ switching blocs,
given the sensitivity of the analysis to bloc configurations and the difficulty of assessing bloc configurations’
plausibility.4

4Countries’ geopolitical alignment could be partly driven by trade
linkages and risk management strategies to reduce the fallout from
spikes in geopolitical tensions. However, the endogenous formation
of blocs remains beyond the scope of the chapter. The two-bloc
scenario presented here is meant to provide a clearly defined baseline
and to make the exercise comparable to those in the recent literature.
Introducing neutral countries reduces the impact of fragmentation,
as discussed later in the chapter.
Online Annex 3.1 provides details on the commodities and countries and their allocation across blocs as well as data sources. Online
Annex 3.5.2 discusses the robustness of some of the key findings to
different bloc configurations. All online annexes are available at

CHAPTER 3

Fragmentation and Commodity Markets: Vulnerabilities and Risks

The main findings are as follows:
•• Commodities are vulnerable in the event of fragmentation. The importance of natural endowments for
production can lead to high geographic concentration of output. For example, the three biggest
suppliers of minerals account for about 70 percent
of global production, on average. Coupled with low
demand elasticities and their upstream use in many
manufacturing processes and key technologies, this
means that commodities are highly traded. However,
many importers rely on just a few suppliers. These
features raise the cost of trade disruptions.
•• There is rising fragmentation in commodity markets.
Measures restricting commodity trade surged in
2022, much more than those restricting trade
in other goods. For selected commodities, price
differentials across geographic markets have
widened. And commodity sector foreign direct
investment (FDI) and cross-border mergers and
acquisitions were on the decline even prior to the
war in Ukraine.
•• Fragmentation could cause large price changes.
The scale of the price effects depends on the
supply-and-demand imbalances caused by fragmentation and the price elasticities of supply and
demand. Illustrative partial equilibrium model
simulations suggest that price effects could be
particularly strong for some minerals critical for the
green transition and some highly traded agricultural
goods. Spikes in agricultural commodity prices
could be concerning for many low-income countries
reliant on imports to feed their population.
•• Fragmented commodity markets would also lead
to higher price volatility. Smaller markets in a
fragmented world would provide fewer buffers
against commodity supply and demand shocks,
leading to larger price responses than under free
trade. Moreover, commodity producers would
have powerful incentives to switch allegiances
given potentially significant differences in commodity prices among blocs. This would induce
more supply shocks, volatility, and uncertainty in
commodity markets, challenging fiscal, monetary,
and financial stability.
•• For many commodity-dependent economies, fragmentation would lead to sizable macroeconomic impacts. For
some low-income countries and emerging market
economies, illustrative trade model simulations point
to long-term output losses exceeding 2 percent.

Due to vastly different and often offsetting
impacts across net commodity-producing and net
commodity-consuming countries, however, economic
losses appear relatively modest at the global level.
This should not lead to complacency: the chapter
quantifies only the restriction of commodity trade
between blocs. Should the world fragment into
isolated blocs, the flows of other goods and services,
finance, technology, and know-how would most
likely also be disrupted, amplifying global economic
costs (Aiyar and others 2023). The higher volatility
and uncertainty brought on by commodity market
fragmentation would complicate policymaking and
add to costs, a channel that is also not captured.
Moreover, within countries, offsetting effects on
commodity consumers and producers imply strong
distributional impacts even absent large aggregate output effects. Fragmentation in agricultural
commodity markets could raise food insecurity in
low-income countries, with high social and humanitarian costs that are not included in the chapter’s
model simulations. In sum, commodity market
fragmentation could deliver a sizable economic blow
in an already challenging environment of slow global
growth, tight financial conditions, and high debt in
many vulnerable countries.
•• Fragmentation in mineral markets could make the
clean energy transition more costly. Demand for
critical minerals is projected to rise severalfold in
a net-zero-carbon-emissions scenario. These minerals are highly concentrated geographically, and
their elasticities of demand and supply are low, so
trade disruptions could add to upward pressure on
mineral prices in the bloc where demand exceeds
supply after fragmentation. But the mineral-rich
bloc cannot reap the benefits from oversupply, as
refining capacity cannot be scaled up quickly. In
the illustrative simulation, fragmentation results in
up to 30 percent lower-than-needed investment in
renewables and electric vehicles (EVs) at the global
level by 2030.

What Makes Commodities Vulnerable in the
Event of Fragmentation?
This section documents several features of commodity markets that would raise the economic costs of
disrupting their trade, despite commodities’ homogeneity and fungibility.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Navigating Global Divergences

Production Concentration
The first production stage of commodities depends
on natural endowments, which can be heavily concentrated geographically. For instance, the extraction of
minerals and energy commodities requires cost-effective
geological deposits. Availability of fertile soil, water, and
an adequate climate can constrain agricultural production and yields. As a result, the three largest-producing
countries account for about 65 percent of the global
output of agriculture, about 50 percent of that of
energy, and about 70 percent of that of mineral
commodities on average (Figure 3.2, panel 1).5
Minerals represent a special case: production is
concentrated both at the first stage (mining) because
of the geographic concentration of deposits, and also
at the second (processing) stage. Relocating production
at the mining stage may be impossible over the short
and medium term, given the importance of natural
endowments.

Elasticities of Supply and Demand
The price elasticity of supply, which measures how
output responds to price changes, is relatively low for
commodities in the short term (Figure 3.2, panel 2).
Scaling up production requires large investments,
environmental permitting, and community consultations that can delay a supply response to price changes.
For example, it takes on average 16 years from exploration to the opening of copper mines (IEA 2021).
Discovering new deposits is also costly and takes time.6
5The chapter focuses on countries and not firms. Commodity
extraction is often undertaken by multinationals or firms owned by
foreign investors (Leruth and others 2022). Firm-level concentration could be different from country-level concentration. However,
governments are typically the ultimate owners of land or reserves and
lease them to firms for a limited time. Renegotiations of lease terms
as well as expropriations are common (Jaakkola, Spiro, and Van
Benthem 2019). The chapter also focuses on production rather than
reserves owing to lack of data availability. Reserves and production
are highly correlated (USGS 2023).
Online Annex 3.2 provides the production and import concentration and the share of trade in output for the commodities.
Concentration of production is also apparent at the firm level, with a
few countries taking stakes in key firms (Leruth and others 2022).
6Elasticities below 1 are generally considered low. See Fally and Sayre
(2018) and Dahl (2020) for a literature review on supply and demand
elasticities across commodities. Arezki, van der Ploeg, and Toscani
(2019) analyze the responsiveness of resource discoveries to market
incentives. It is worth noting that the sizable investments needed to
expand the supply of commodities may be hindered by the disruptions
in external capital flows and higher uncertainty that geoeconomic fragmentation might trigger, as discussed in the April 2023 World Economic
Outlook and April 2023 Global Financial Stability Report.

International Monetary Fund | October 2023

Setting up processing capacity comes with its own
challenges, such as regulations; access to know-how,
technology, and skilled labor; infrastructure requirements; and labor costs (IEA 2023). These help explain
the geographic concentration at the refining and processing stages.
On the demand side, many commodities are inputs
for key technologies and products or are essential to
household consumption (food, heating, cooking, and
transportation are examples). Disruptions to their
supply can cause ripple effects across sectors and value
chains. As upstream inputs for the production of a
vast array of goods and services (Figure 3.2, panel 3),
they are often hard to substitute, and demand
responds little to swings in prices. This is reflected in
their low price elasticity of demand, particularly in
the short term.

Importance of Trade
With production highly concentrated and demand
often broadly spread across countries, commodities are
heavily traded. Their homogeneity and fungibility—
despite low demand and supply elasticities, commodities have a high elasticity of substitution across
suppliers—also contribute to market integration. The
share of production traded internationally is higher
for most commodities than the ratio of world trade to
gross output (Figure 3.2, panel 4). On average across
agricultural and energy commodities, about 30 percent
of output is dedicated to trade and about 45 percent
for minerals, with the shares substantially higher for
many commodities.7
As a result, imports satisfy a large part of the demand
for commodities. However, many countries depend on
only a handful of suppliers (Figure 3.2, panel 5). For
example, roughly half of the world’s countries rely on
three or fewer exporting countries for their imports of
minerals, and a quarter on only one. This leaves them
vulnerable to supply disruptions in the near term.8
7Even

though commodities are heavily traded, their share in
global trade has declined as trade liberalization, lower transportation
costs, and cross-border production chains have supported the rapid
rise in intermediate-goods trade. The share of primary goods in total
goods trade declined from roughly 45 percent in the first half of
the 20th century to about 13 percent in 2019–21 (Online Annex
Figure 3.2.4).
8Historically, countries were often able to adapt to trade disruptions over the medium to long term by finding alternative suppliers,
because of commodities’ homogeneity, or by developing substitutes
(see Box 3.2).

Import dependence in agricultural commodities
can lead to food insecurity in case of trade disruptions, particularly in low-income countries. For
instance, the average low-income country imports
more than 80 percent of the wheat it consumes.
Given low storage capacity, consumption smoothing can be difficult in these countries, exposing

populations to large swings in prices or food shortages (Figure 3.2, panel 6). The ramifications of food
commodity shocks, which have been linked to social
unrest, conflict, and migration (Kelley and others
2015; ­Missirian and Schlenker 2017; Burke and
McGuirk 2020), go beyond the economic analysis
that follows.

that changes in military alliances because of rising geopolitical tensions could go hand in hand with disruptions of

Distance of military alliances is measured using the similarity between countries’
portfolios of military alliances and standardized so its standard deviation is 1 in
each year. A standardized military distance of 1 is approximately the distance
between India and Morocco in 2018.

Sensitivity to Geopolitics
Analysis of trade patterns suggests that commodity
trade is historically associated with countries’ ­geopolitical
alignment. Gravity equations, estimated for the commodities in the sample and augmented to include the similarity
between countries’ portfolios of military alliances, show
that bilateral commodity trade flows are negatively associated with military distance (­Figure 3.3).9 However, notable
differences are apparent in the strength of the relationship
across types of commodities: a one-standard-deviation
increase in the distance of military alliances (approximately
the distance between India and Morocco in 2018) is
9The

gravity model is widely used to explain bilateral trade flows
based on country and country pair characteristics that capture
trading costs, such as geographic distance or a common border, language, or currency. Online Annex 3.3 provides details and robustness
checks. Distance in military alliances is associated with lower trade in
minerals across specifications. The results are more sensitive for other
measures of geopolitical alignments, namely, the ideal point distance
based on UN votes, used in Chapter 4 of the April 2023 World
Economic Outlook in a similar analysis for FDI flows (see also Jakubik and Ruta 2023). Hakobyan, Meleshchuk, and Zymek (2023)
examine distance in military alliances and sectoral trade flows.

International Monetary Fund | October 2023

This section takes stock of various measures of
fragmentation. The number of new interventions in
commodity trade has risen every year since 2018, with
the increase initially fueled by tensions between China
and the United States and the COVID-19 pandemic.
In 2022, Russia’s war in Ukraine caused a major spike
in new trade restrictions for commodities: there were
more than six times more new restrictions affecting
trade in commodities in 2022 than the 2016–19 average. In contrast, trade-restricting measures on overall
trade increased 3.5 times (­Figure 3.4, panel 1).10
Price dispersion across locations can also be a symptom of fragmentation: as commodities are homogeneous goods, they should trade under one price after
transportation costs are accounted for. However, price
dispersion increased in major commodity markets in
2022, especially in those for some minerals, such as
lithium, and energy commodities (Figure 3.4, panel 2).
For example, Russian coal traded at a price almost
three times lower than Australian coal in September
2022. Price dispersion for crude oil and natural gas
also rose as the war in Ukraine and associated sanctions disrupted trade. Box 3.1 documents shifts in
trade flows using real-time vessel-tracking data.
Other proxies for fragmentation are changes in the
number of FDI projects and cross-border mergers and
acquisitions, which are also indicators of future trade.
They were declining in the energy and mineral sectors
even before the war in Ukraine, which could presage a
slowdown in commodity trade (Figure 3.4, panel 3).11
Shifts have also occurred in the origin and destination
10Trade interventions in the Global Trade Alert database, the
source for the data in Figure 3.4, panel 1, include both measures
that increase fragmentation, such as import tariffs and export restrictions, and measures that aim to limit the economic fallout from
fragmentation by encouraging diversification, such as subsidies for
local producers, local-content requirements, and the like—although
a strict distinction between the two is difficult.
11Following Chapter 4 of the April 2023 World Economic Outlook,
the analysis focuses on the number rather than the value for FDI
and cross-border mergers and acquisitions. Data on values are
limited and often estimated. However, FDI values suggest a similar
decline in the commodity sector.

CHAPTER 3

Fragmentation and Commodity Markets: Vulnerabilities and Risks

No measure of fragmentation is perfect. It is still
too early to assess how long-lasting price dispersion
will be. The decline in FDI could reflect moderation in commodity prices since 2015, following
the decade-long commodity boom, and it is not
clear, on account of lagging data, to what extent
trade-restricting measures have affected trade flows
(Goldberg and Reed 2023). However, taken together,
these measures suggest rising commodity market
fragmentation.

of commodity FDI and cross-border mergers and

and Russia have increased their investments in Africa
(see Online Annex Figure 3.2.5).12
12Chapter 4 of the April 2023 World Economic Outlook documents
FDI flows are increasingly concentrated among geopolitically aligned
countries, particularly in strategic sectors.

To assess individual commodities’ vulnerability
in the event of fragmentation, this section presents
results from a single-commodity, multicountry partial
equilibrium model based on Alvarez and others (2023)
(see also Online Annex 3.4 for details). It computes
price changes that would occur if trade for each of the
48 commodities included in the analysis were banned
across two blocs.
For illustrative purposes, the main scenario
assumes that the two theoretical blocs are constructed
based on the 2022 UN vote on Russia’s war in
Ukraine. The bloc comprising countries that voted
for Russia to withdraw from Ukraine is labeled the
“US-Europe+ bloc”; the remaining countries are in
the “China-Russia+ bloc.”13 The exercise assumes,
in a highly stylized and extreme way, that there is
no trade in a particular commodity between blocs,
whereas intrabloc trade of the commodity is unaffected. Box 3.2 discusses more fluid experiences of
fragmentation; investigating the impacts of those
intermediate scenarios is beyond the scope of the
chapter. Rather, the chapter’s goal is to identify relative vulnerabilities across commodity markets and to
illustrate transmission channels, with the recognition
that partial interactions between blocs and arbitrage opportunities could mute the economic effects
implied by the model simulations.
For each commodity, the model’s initial calibration is based on observed 2019 trade flows. They are
assumed to reflect an integrated world, where goods
are traded at one global price.14 The trade ban across
13See also Chapter 3 of the October 2022 Regional Economic
Outlook: Asia and Pacific. More details on the countries in each bloc
and sensitivity checks for other bloc configurations are in Alvarez
and others (2023) and Online Annexes 3.1.2 and 3.5.2.
14The assumption of perfect trade integration in the baseline oversimplifies reality, as markets for some commodities were not perfectly
integrated globally even before the war in Ukraine.

International Monetary Fund | October 2023

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Navigating Global Divergences

blocs yields bloc-specific prices that clear bloc-level
supply and demand.
Fragmentation would induce opposite price effects
across blocs. The price of a commodity falls in the bloc
that used to be a net exporter of that commodity and
increases in the net importing bloc. The size of price
changes depends on (1) bloc-level supply-and-demand
imbalances prior to fragmentation—that is, the extent
to which a bloc relies on imports to satisfy its demand
at the integrated world price—and (2) the capacity of
demand and supply to respond to changing prices (the
price elasticities of demand and supply). Commodities
with inelastic demand and supply and with high imbalances across blocs are more vulnerable to price changes.15
Model simulations suggest that the potential price
impact of fragmentation would vary significantly across
commodities, with some potentially experiencing very
large price increases (Figure 3.5; see Online Annex
Figure 3.5.1 for the underlying commodity-specific
results).16 In the China-Russia+ bloc, the price of
mined minerals, including cobalt, lithium, copper,
and nickel, which are critical for the green transition,
would rise substantially. Production of these minerals would be concentrated in a handful of countries
in the US-Europe+ bloc, but they are largely used as
inputs in the China-Russia+ bloc (see Online Annex
­Figure 3.2.6). At the same time, the US-Europe+ bloc
could experience similar increases in the prices of
refined minerals, which are processed mostly in China,
Russia, and South Africa.
In contrast, the potential price changes for energy
and most agricultural commodities are more subdued
in the main simulation. Since the production of these
commodities is less geographically concentrated,
supply and demand are more balanced across the two
blocs. However, palm oil and soybean represent two
important outliers: more than 80 percent of production would occur in the US-Europe+ bloc, whereas
most of the consumption would take place in the
China-Russia+ bloc.
Because of high geographic concentration, the
vulnerability of commodities in the event of fragmentation depends on the distribution of key exporters (and
importers) across blocs. Simulations based on different

exercise does not explicitly model storage, which is an
important feature of volatility smoothing. See among others, Williams
(1936), Gustafson (1958), and Wright and Williams (1982). Carter,

remaining countries are included in the “China-Russia+ bloc.”

country compositions of the two hypothetical blocs,
described in Online Annex 3.5.2, suggest that, in a way
similar to what occurs in the main simulation, fragmentation would lead to significant price increases for minerals
at the mining stage and for key agricultural staples (such
as soybeans) in the China-Russia+ bloc. In an alternative
bloc scenario, in which all emerging market and developing economies, excluding India, Indonesia, and Latin
American countries, are assigned to the China-Russia+
bloc, the US-Europe+ bloc could experience large price
increases for some minerals. This is because key producers
are allocated to the other bloc. It could also become more
vulnerable in case of trade restrictions on some agricultural commodities (such as cocoa) and crude oil.

Higher Commodity Price Volatility
Fragmented commodity markets would lead to
higher price volatility (see Jacks, O’Rourke, and
Williamson 2011, for historical evidence). This would
challenge public finances and fiscal and monetary
frameworks, giving rise to potential procyclicality of
fiscal and monetary policies and hurting economic

stability (Cavalcanti, Mohaddes, and Raissi 2015;
IMF 2023). Fragmentation can affect price volatility
through at least two channels: smaller market sizes and
countries switching blocs.17

Figure 3.6. Wheat Price Increase in the US-Europe+ Bloc due
to a Harvest Shock
(Percent)
10

Smaller Market Sizes
In a fragmented world, markets would become
smaller and bloc-level prices more responsive to
country-level shocks (see also Albrizio and others
2023). In the partial equilibrium model, the price
response is proportional to the supply shock’s size relative to the overall market. Thus, by restricting the set of
countries with which they trade, countries would face
larger price increases in response to the same negative
supply shocks.18 In an illustrative example, Figure 3.6
compares the price impact of a three-standard-deviation
shock to the US wheat harvest in an integrated market
with that in a fragmented market.19 The same supply
shock doubles the impact on wheat prices when trade
is fragmented into two smaller blocs. This is important,
as climate change is expected to raise the variability of
agricultural output. A fragmented world, in which the
price response to supply shocks is amplified, would be
less able to cope with this challenge.
Countries Switching Blocs
In a fragmented world, major commodity producers
would face powerful incentives to switch geopolitical allegiances, with such switching representing a
new source of supply shocks and price volatility. For
highly concentrated commodity markets, a single
exporting country switching to the other bloc could
lead to a large supply gap and trigger hefty price
changes. Uncertainty about a country’s geopolitical alignment could itself lead to price volatility as
traders update their priors regarding potentially large
fragmentation-induced price swings.

17Other

channels could include the impact on the financial
ecosystem linked to commodities, such as derivatives and insurance (FSB 2023).

Note: The bars in the ﬁgure depict the change in the price of wheat in the
US-Europe+ bloc (those countries that voted for Russia to withdraw from Ukraine
in the 2022 UN vote on the Ukraine war) from a three-standard-deviation negative
shock to US wheat production. The ﬁgure compares the price increases in the bloc
in a free-trade world to those in a fragmented world.

To illustrate price sensitivity to countries switching
blocs, Figure 3.7 shows the distribution of the greatest price increases each commodity can experience in
a bloc when a single exporting country switches its
alliance.20 Minerals at the mining stage tend to be
the most sensitive, given their highly concentrated
production. For example, South Africa produces
one-third of the world’s manganese, a metal used in
steelmaking and batteries. If South Africa switched to
the US-Europe+ bloc, the price of manganese in the
China-Russia+ bloc could rise more than 800 percent.

Economic Impacts of Commodity Market
Fragmentation
This section sheds light on the macroeconomic
impacts of fragmenting commodity markets on
individual economies, blocs, and the global economy.
Three complementary analytical approaches are used.21

Size of Supply Shock Relative to Market

a supply shock is Price Change = – ​ ___
   
    ​,
Elasticity of Supply − Elasticity of Demand
with Elasticity of Demand < 0 (Alvarez and others 2023).
19The United States accounts for about 7 percent of global and
15 percent of US-Europe+ bloc wheat production. A three-standard-­
deviation US harvest shock corresponds to about 60 percent of US
wheat production, or 4 percent of global output, with wheat prices held
constant. The exercise uses a price elasticity of supply of 0.2 and a price
elasticity of demand of –0.85 (see Alvarez and others 2023). Lower
elasticities would lead to higher price impacts, and fragmentation would
still double the price impact in this example.

20These results are based on Alvarez and others (2023). Online
Annex Figure 3.5.2 zooms into the results in Figure 3.7 by showing
the 15 commodities whose prices are most vulnerable to a single
exporter switching blocs and the implied price changes.
21Online Annexes 3.4–3.6; Alvarez and others (2023); and Bolhuis,
Chen, and Kett (2023) discuss the assumptions, calibration, and
additional results of each model. None of the approaches consider the
impact of fragmentation on productivity and innovation. The role of
the financial sector is also outside of the scope of the chapter.

approach. First, inefficiencies associated with restricting trade result in losses in bloc-level total surplus: the
global economy is worse off from the fragmentation
of trade in individual commodities (see Figure 3.8,
panel 1).22
Second, bloc-level changes in total surplus are generally small (with some notable exceptions23), masking
important heterogeneities across countries. Within
each bloc, some countries would experience an increase
in surplus (net-exporting countries in a net-importing
bloc and net-importing countries in a net-exporting
bloc), and some experience a decline. Such changes
would be small for most countries as a share of gross
national expenditure but could be very sizable for a
few commodity importers and exporters, as shown in
Online Annex Figure 3.5.4. For instance, fragmentation of copper at the mining stage would reduce surplus by as much as 2.5 to 5 percent of gross national
expenditure in Chile and Peru, both exporters of
copper to the US-Europe+ bloc, in which prices would
fall. At the same time, it would lead to large surplus
gains in Kazakhstan and Mongolia, which would
scale up exports at higher prices to the copper-scarce
China-Russia+ bloc (­Figure 3.8, panel 2).
Third, restricting trade in commodities that are
less price-vulnerable could still generate sizable

First, the partial equilibrium model discussed earlier
is leveraged to compute changes in producer and
consumer surplus due to fragmentation in individual
commodity markets. The resulting change in total surplus is used as an indicator of economic impact. This
approach identifies the most macro-relevant commodities. It accounts for the changes in price and quantities
consumed or produced of each commodity because of
fragmentation. However, due to its partial equilibrium
nature, the approach does not account for sectoral
spillover effects, nor does it allow for the simultaneous disruption of trade in many commodities, which
could have opposing or reinforcing effects within the
same country.
Two general equilibrium models in the chapter
overcome these shortcomings. A static multicountry, multisector trade model, which accounts for
all input-output linkages across sectors, is used to
simulate the long-term GDP losses associated with

result and the following are based Alvarez and others
(2023). They also provide the analytical proof. In an integrated
world, trade patterns reflect the efficient allocation of resources globally, with countries specializing in commodities for which they have
comparative advantage (cost-effective deposits or suitable climate
conditions). After fragmentation, trade patterns no longer reflect
these comparative advantages.
23Online Annex Figure 3.5.3 shows the five largest surplus losses
at the bloc level from the fragmentation of a single commodity.
Such data points are marked as outliers in Figure 3.8, panel 1,
capped at –0.05 percent of gross national expenditure. In the
main simulation, trade fragmentation of palm oil or copper at the
mining stage could lead to surplus losses in the China-Russia+ bloc
of more than 1 percent of gross national expenditure, and trade
fragmentation of iron ore or soybeans to surplus losses of more
than 0.5 percent.

Finally, surplus declines would generally be larger
in the hypothetical China-Russia+ bloc. Commodities
that are most vulnerable are more broadly consumed in
this bloc (Online Annex Figure 3.5.3).24

Note: “Energy” refers to coal, natural gas, and crude oil. In panel 1, each data
point in the box plots represents the total bloc-level surplus change from
fragmenting trade in a single commodity. The black squares in the bars represent
the median, the bars are the interquartile range, and the whiskers reﬂect the data
points within 1.5 times the interquartile range from the 25th or 75th percentile
across commodities in the group. Dots indicate outliers; the commodities

surplus declines. For example, energy commodities
are not particularly vulnerable under the baseline bloc
­configuration, but the associated declines in surplus
would be more significant, because energy commodities are widely consumed and produced. In contrast,
minerals could experience strong price changes, but
the surplus impact would be more subdued, given
their (so far) more limited relevance in most countries’
production and consumption.

The general equilibrium multicountry, multisector
trade model presented in Box 3.3 simulates long-term
GDP effects from the disruption of all commodity
trade. Broad differences are seen in the impact across
countries, with some experiencing sizable losses.
Low-income countries could suffer deeper losses, on
average estimated at 1.2 percent, given their high
dependence on agricultural trade. For some of these
countries losses could amount to more than 2 percent of GDP. Consistent with the single-commodity
exercise, the hypothetical China-Russia+ bloc is more
affected by fragmentation, yet the global GDP loss, at
roughly 0.3 percent, is modest as a result of offsetting
effects across countries.25
The economic impact can be greatly reduced if
commodity trade is only partially restricted. Illustrative
simulations, in which countries that abstained from the
UN vote on Ukraine are assumed to trade commodities freely, point to much smaller effects of trade barriers between the US-Europe+ and the China-Russia+
blocs. Long-term changes in global GDP from this
scenario would be negligible, with meaningful losses
only in Russia. This is in line with historical evidence
on the ability of demand and supply of commodities
to adjust in response to trade restrictions (Box 3.2).

Evidence from the Dynamic Macroeconomic Model
This subsection uses a dynamic stochastic general
equilibrium framework to assess the dynamic GDP
and inflation effects of commodity fragmentation.
The model is based on an augmented version of the
24Sensitivity checks in Online Annex 3.5.2 show that this holds
for a bloc configuration based on existing trade relationships. Alternatively, if all emerging market and developing economies, excluding
India, Indonesia, and Latin American countries, are assigned to the
China-Russia+ bloc, the US-Europe+ bloc could experience larger
surplus losses, mainly on account of oil market disruptions.
25Global GDP losses from restricting commodity flows between
blocs constitute about 15 percent of the loss from restricting all
trade. In comparison, commodities represent only 10 percent of total
trade. The larger losses from fragmenting energy and agricultural
markets in Bolhuis, Chen, and Kett (2023) stem from the assumption of full autarky compared with the no-trade-between-blocs
scenario in the chapter.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Navigating Global Divergences

IMF’s Global Macroeconomic Model for the Energy
Transition.26 It includes the production, consumption,
and trade of energy from fossil and renewable sources
as well as four minerals critical to the energy transition. Commodities include crude oil, coal, natural gas,
copper, nickel, cobalt, and lithium, capturing about
70 percent of the value of global commodity trade.
Fragmentation is modeled as a ban on trading these
commodities between the two hypothetical blocs,
which comprise six different regions.
In the model, fragmentation affects activity through
several channels. First, the trade ban induces expenditure
switching and trade diversion. Second, temporary imbalances between supply and demand within blocs emerge
until prices adjust to clear markets. Such imbalances
generate swings in commodity prices. Finally, rigidities
affect the speed of adjustment of output, use, and trade,
as well as overall macroeconomic effects.
The output and inflation effects could vary significantly across regions, blocs, and commodities
(Figure 3.9). Comparison of the impact on individual
commodities highlights the channels at play. The effects
of fragmenting trade in oil and gas would be quite different, even though the distribution of oil and gas consumption and production would be similar across blocs.
For oil, countries could quickly switch to trading partners within their bloc, with limited impact on GDP. By
contrast, rigidities such as the need for pipelines or other
structures would constrain natural gas trade diversion,
with more pronounced effects on GDP. GDP would
decline and inflation would increase in both blocs.
In the case of minerals, simulations highlight the
importance of the geographic distribution of mining
production and rigidities in scaling up refining capacity.
On the one hand, fragmentation could lead to a steep
rise in prices in the China-Russia+ bloc and sizable
declines in real GDP. Roughly 80 percent of the supply
of the four minerals is mined in the US-Europe+ bloc,
and minerals are used intensively in the China-Russia+
bloc’s sizable manufacturing and construction sector. On
the other hand, the US-Europe+ bloc would not be able
to benefit from the relative oversupply of minerals at the
mining stage because it would take several years to scale
26The model was first used in Chapter 3 of the October 2022
World Economic Outlook. It is augmented here by (1) including
the possibility of segmenting tradable energy markets and (2)
explicitly modeling two types of mineral aggregates composed
of copper and nickel as well as cobalt and lithium, respectively.
The augmented model has six regions: the United States, the
European Union, US-EU-leaning countries, China, Russia, and
China-Russia-leaning countries.

up refining capacity. That bloc would also experience a
GDP decline from mineral market fragmentation.
Trade fragmentation of all seven commodities would
be associated with a global GDP loss of about 0.3 percent. However, as in the partial equilibrium and trade
models, sizable differences are observed across and
within blocs. The simulated losses would be larger in
the China-Russia+ bloc. Within the US-Europe+ bloc,
Europe could experience a sizable impact on inflation
(as much as 100 basis points or more) and GDP, with
that impact driven mainly by the fragmentation of oil
and gas markets.
Several caveats are worth highlighting. Whereas
the model provides regional granularity, it masks the
heterogeneity of effects across countries, given the

CHAPTER 3

highly concentrated nature of commodity production. Second, modeling and data constraints allow
for the inclusion of only a subset of commodities.
Third, the model does not capture the cost from a
more volatile inflationary regime, which could make
monetary policy more difficult. Finally, the model,
like the two complementary analyses preceding it, uses
prepandemic data on mineral usage and trade flows.
Given the sizable projected increase in demand for
these minerals throughout the green transition, the
macroeconomic relevance of disrupting trade in these
commodities will probably be greater—as discussed in
the next section.

Implications for the Clean Energy Transition
Fragmentation of commodity markets could affect
the cost of decarbonization. Minerals such as copper, nickel, cobalt, and lithium are key inputs for the
energy transition. They are used in EVs, in batteries
and wiring, and in renewable-energy technologies
such as solar panels and wind turbines. Demand for
these critical minerals could increase substantially
(IEA 2023), and they could become as important to
the world economy in a net-zero-emissions scenario as
crude oil (Boer, Pescatori, and Stuermer 2023).
Under the scenario of net zero emissions by 2050,
the IEA (2023) projects demand for copper to grow
by a factor of 1.5, that for nickel and cobalt to double,
and that for lithium to increase six times by 2030. This
could raise prices substantially, as mining and refining are hard to scale up and are highly concentrated
geographically (Figure 3.2, panel 1; Online Annex
Figure 3.2.2). For example, Chile and Peru mine more
than a third of the world’s copper, and Indonesia and
the Philippines about half its nickel.
Using the augmented Global Macroeconomic Model
for the Energy Transition, this section illustrates the
potential effects of mineral market fragmentation on
energy transition dynamics.27 The analysis focuses on
minerals because they are key inputs for green technologies. The study of fragmentation of other commodity
27Modeling

the net effects of fragmentation on innovation and
government policies in green technologies, in the more efficient
use of commodities, in substitution, and in extraction technologies
is beyond the scope of this chapter. There could be competing
long-term effects within and across blocs that are not captured by
the supply and demand elasticities used in the model (see Acemoglu
2002; Acemoglu and others 2012; Schwerhoff and Stuermer 2020;
Hassler, Krusell, and Olovsson 2021; Góes and Bekkers 2022; and
Lemoine, forthcoming).

markets relevant for the green transition (such as oil
and natural gas markets) is left to future research.
The analysis uses projected increases in demand for
key critical minerals in a net-zero-emissions scenario
(IEA 2023), with the projections assuming that policy
incentives stimulate investment in renewable-energy
technologies and EVs. It first assumes free commodity
trade. With policies left unchanged, it then compares
the results with those under a counterfactual scenario
of complete mineral market fragmentation across the
two hypothetical blocs.
In the integrated-world baseline, the model
indicates that world prices of the four key minerals considered could rise by about 90 percent, on
average, along the net-zero-emissions-scenario path
to 2030. If critical mineral markets are fragmented,
the inability of the hypothetical China-Russia+ bloc
to import copper, nickel, lithium, and cobalt from
countries such as Chile, the Democratic Republic of
the Congo, and Indonesia would lead to an additional price increase in that bloc of 300 percent, on
average. Acquiring minerals would be more expensive,
which would lead to lower investment in solar panels
and wind turbines and fewer EVs (Figure 3.10). In
this net zero scenario, there would be about 70 percent fewer new EVs in the China-Russia+ bloc in a
fragmented world than in an integrated world.28
Fragmentation would cause an oversupply of minerals in the hypothetical US-Europe+ bloc. However,
the time needed to scale up mineral refining capacity is
assumed to constrain the use of minerals in that bloc.
Hence, fragmentation generates only small gains in
the US-Europe+ bloc, with a slightly higher number
of EVs produced, but no gains in renewable-energy
capacity, by 2030.
On balance, global net investment in renewable
technology and production of EVs would be roughly
20 percent lower compared with the baseline because
of mineral market fragmentation.29 This shortfall
28In the fragmentation scenario, China’s fiscal cost of supporting
investment in reverting to the net-zero-emissions path would be
1½–2 percent of GDP. Quantifying the impact of fragmentation on
emissions reduction is outside the scope of this chapter.
29These findings are robust to assuming that technological progress
would improve the substitutability of minerals with other inputs.
Doubling the elasticity of substitution of the four minerals would
reduce the decline in investment in renewable technology from
20 percent to 12 percent, for instance. The shortfall in global green
investment because of fragmentation would be more muted, however, if key producers of minerals (Chile, the Democratic Republic of
the Congo, Peru) were assigned to the China-Russia+ bloc instead.
See the exercise on countries switching blocs earlier in the chapter.

would increase to about 30 percent if one uses greenhouse gas emissions to weigh the regional response
of investment in renewables and EVs. The measure
accounts for the greater emissions intensity of activity
in the China-Russia+ bloc and hence the greater effort
needed to achieve global emissions mitigation goals.30
Decarbonizing the world economy would be more
difficult if the market for minerals is fragmented.

Summary and Policy Implications
Commodity markets are an important channel
through which geopolitical fragmentation can affect
the economy. Many features of commodities underpin
their vulnerability in the event of fragmentation: their
30The China-Russia+ bloc accounted for more than half of
greenhouse gas emissions in 2020, but only a third of global
GDP. Hence, global investment losses are significantly larger when

(the bars in Figure 3.10).

highly concentrated and difficult-to-relocate production, hard-to-substitute consumption, and critical role
as inputs for manufacturing and key technologies. Fragmentation in commodity markets is on the rise. Measures restricting commodity trade surged in 2022, price
differentials across geographic markets have widened
for selected commodities, and FDI flows in commodity
sectors are in decline—the latter a trend that started
before the war in Ukraine.
Illustrative model simulations suggest that more severe
fragmentation could cause large changes in commodity
prices, depending on the resulting supply-and-demand
imbalances and commodities’ elasticities of supply and
demand. Critical minerals for the energy transition and
some highly traded agricultural goods are highly vulnerable in the event of fragmentation.
A fragmented world would be more volatile. Commodity price volatility could intensify as a result of
smaller market sizes and the incentives for producers
to switch geopolitical allegiances. This could result in
volatile inflation dynamics, making monetary policy
more complex.
The potential impacts of fragmentation differ vastly
across countries, with offsetting effects across consumer and producer countries resulting in modest
output losses at the global level. Low-income countries, on average, would experience significantly deeper
long-term output declines. Given the heavy reliance
on agricultural imports among many low-income
countries, fragmentation of agricultural commodities
would raise important food security concerns. Illustrative model simulations suggest that a hypothetical
China-Russia+ bloc could be more affected economically than a US-Europe+ bloc, although the economic
impact would be reduced if commodity trade was only
partially restricted or there was a nonaligned bloc.
Overall, further fragmentation of commodity markets
could deliver an additional blow in an already challenging environment of slow global growth, tight financial
conditions, and high debt, a blow that would be particularly harsh for some of the most vulnerable economies.
Fragmentation in critical mineral markets could
make the clean energy transition more costly, raising
the risks of delaying necessary climate change mitigation. It could add to the upward price pressure in the
mineral-scarce bloc in the chapter’s illustrative model
simulation. The mineral-rich bloc in the simulation
could not reap the benefits from oversupply in the near
term because it would be unable to scale up refining
and processing capacity quickly. In the simulation,

CHAPTER 3

Fragmentation and Commodity Markets: Vulnerabilities and Risks

fragmentation results in lower-than-needed global
investment in renewables and EVs by 2030 by as much
as 30 percent.
Given these findings, should advanced economies
try to keep commodity trade open? Should emerging
market and developing economies be concerned about
the potentially higher cost of the green transition? For
both questions, the answer is yes.
Even if the simulations suggest that commodity
fragmentation would not result in very deep aggregate output losses in a US-Europe+ bloc, the threat
of derailing the global green energy transition should
give advanced economies pause. With more than half
of worldwide emissions generated by the hypothetical
China-Russia+ bloc, averting climate disaster globally
hinges on the ability of the economies in that bloc to
make a successful and timely clean energy transition.
On the other hand, many low- and medium-income
countries, whose main objective is raising living standards, may want to think twice, considering the threat
of lower output and higher inflation from commodity
market fragmentation.
All countries would suffer from the greater volatility
and uncertainty that fragmented commodity markets
would bring. A protracted process of fragmentation,
driven by complex and hard-to-predict policy measures
and fluid implementation, would also heighten uncertainty, depressing private investment and potentially
diverting scarce public resources toward a suboptimal
reshoring of commodity supply.
Preventing fragmentation of commodity markets
is the first-best response. Multilateral cooperation
can provide guardrails and prevent a vicious spiral of
countries imposing restrictions as a risk management
effort to mitigate the economic fallout from fragmentation. First-best multilateral solutions include
enhanced rules within the World Trade Organization
on quantitative restrictions, export tariffs, discriminatory subsidies, local-content requirements, and other
commodity-related trade measures (see Bown 2023).
This is crucial for food commodities, as food insecurity
affects a large swath of the population in low-income
countries.31

31Giordani, Rocha, and Ruta (2016) show that on top of the
usual distortionary effects, trade-restricting measures for food can
have multiplier effects. High food prices can trigger export restrictions while importers reduce import tariffs. These policies exacerbate
tensions in world food markets and could generate another round of
trade restrictions.

Second-best solutions can also be considered. Given
the potentially adverse effects of fragmentation on
the energy transition, a minimum “green corridor”
agreement should be established to preserve integrated
markets for minerals that are critical for decarbonization. Safeguarding the flow of these minerals can
be part of a foundational minimum agreement across
countries. Without underestimation of the political
difficulties, such a corridor agreement could be easier
to agree on, because it would focus on a smaller set
of commodities and countries. Similar “food corridor” agreements could provide guardrails in essential
agricultural commodity markets, ensure equal access to
food across countries of all income levels, and reduce
the likelihood of humanitarian disasters in a world of
more frequent supply shocks.
While many minerals used in clean energy technologies are bound to become critical for the global
economy, the paucity of data on their consumption,
production, and inventories raises uncertainty for
producers and consumers and could hide potential
risks for financial markets. In this respect, the international community could facilitate the green transition
and support energy security by setting up a platform
or organization to improve sharing and standardization
of international data on mineral production, consumption, and inventories. The initiative could be similar to
the Joint Organisations Data Initiative for fossil fuels
and the Agricultural Market Information System for
food commodities.
Even as policymakers strive to mitigate the risk of
fragmentation, countries can take steps to minimize
the potential economic fallout. The geographic concentration of production and lack of diversification of
commodity suppliers call for (1) fostering investment
in domestic mining, exploration, and recycling of
critical minerals; (2) diversification of supply sources;
and (3) investing in infrastructure to reduce trade costs
and improve market integration. Support for innovation to speed technological progress—and develop
substitutes—would enhance efficiency in the use and
buildup of strategic reserves. Multilateral cooperation would enhance efficiency and prevent negative
cross-country spillovers.
Broader policies that strengthen countries’ resilience to shocks can help mitigate the effects of
commodity shocks. These include strengthening macroeconomic, structural, and fiscal policy frameworks;
building fiscal and financial buffers; and developing
preparedness plans in case of sudden disruptions in

International Monetary Fund | October 2023

commodity supply. Countries should also reinforce
social safety nets to protect vulnerable households
from higher commodity prices and volatility. Since
fragmentation in physical commodity markets could
exacerbate financial market volatility and result in
sharp exchange rate adjustments, policy measures that
prevent disruptions in commodity-derivatives markets
and financial instability may be warranted (April
2023 Global Financial Stability Report).
Industrial policies are only the third-best approach
and must be designed carefully to ensure equal treatment of firms across competitive markets to avert
adverse cross-country spillovers, minimize distortions
and inefficiencies, and mitigate fiscal risks and harmful

86

political economy outcomes. “Friend-shoring” policies
can also be market distorting and costly. Both sets of
policies should be used only under particular conditions, such as in the presence of clear market failures or
narrowly defined national security concerns. Domestic
and global costs are more limited—and economies
more resilient to shocks—if restriction-free trade applies
to larger economic zones. Country-based restrictions
on domestic content are suboptimal, because they can
interfere with price signals, reduce competition, and
therefore lower productivity. Developing a framework
for international consultations on friend-shoring practices could help identify negative cross-border spillovers
and mitigate adverse consequences.

and insurance services to tankers carrying Russian
commodities above certain price thresholds.
Automatic Identification System data reveal that the
traffic patterns of Russia’s tankers have since changed
substantially (Figure 3.1.1). Tanker shipments from Russian ports to Japan, the United States, and the European
Union declined between April–June 2019 and the same
period in 2023. Other countries are also now providing
oil supplies. For example, the European Union receives
more shipments from countries such as Norway, the
United Arab Emirates, and the United States, but this
extends the length of tanker routes by 20 percent.2
On the flip side, Russian oil shipments rose after the
invasion to countries such as China, India, Türkiye,
and the United Arab Emirates. About 35 to 40 percent of India’s crude oil imports came from Russia
during April–June 2023, a stark rise from less than
5 percent before the war in Ukraine. While India’s oil
exports (mostly petroleum products) are small relative
to its oil imports (mostly crude oil), India increased its
oil exports to the European Union substantially.

The European Union, United Kingdom, and United
States banned most imports of crude oil and petroleum products from Russia after Russia’s invasion of
Ukraine. Western restrictions on dollar payments have
been reported to be a barrier to shipments. Group of
Seven (G7) members also prohibited transportation

History points to a fluid range of experiences of fragmentation in commodity markets: from full trade disruption
during World War II, to limited and controlled trade
during the Cold War, to trade embargoes and other export
restrictions. Fragmentation has rarely lasted, given commodities’ fungibility and arbitrage opportunities.
During World War II, trade among the
three major blocs—German-controlled Europe,
Japanese-controlled Asia, and the rest of the world
(the Allies)—stopped (Findlay and O’Rourke 2007).1
Some blocs faced commodity shortages: for example,
shortages of crude oil (produced mostly by the Allies)
in Germany and Japan and of natural rubber (produced mostly by Japan) in the Allies (Tuttle 1981). In
both cases, governments worked with firms to alleviate
shortages. Germany developed a coal-based synthetic
fuel industry. By 1940, the fuel it produced accounted
for nearly half of Germany’s oil supply and 95 percent
of its aviation fuel (Painter 2012). The US government
stockpiled natural rubber and worked with industry to
develop synthetic rubber (ACS 1998).
During the Cold War, trade between the US-led
and the Soviet Union–led blocs was limited as a result
of the Soviet strategy of self-sufficiency.2 The Soviet
Union traded crude oil, natural gas, and some metals
for manufactured and agricultural goods, especially
wheat. Traders often skirted government policies to
The author of this box is Peter Nagle.
1Trade between blocs and neutral countries was affected by
the war. For example, the United Kingdom and United States
bought much of the Spanish tungsten output to raise its price
and limit availability for Germany. Between 1941 and 1943, the
price of tungsten rose 13-fold (Caruana and Rockoff 2001).
2East-West trade was sharply reduced by the Cold War, from
three-quarters of trade by the East in 1938 to 14 percent in
1953. In contrast, within-bloc trade and interdependence rose
(Spulber and Gehrels 1958; Foreman-Peck 1995).

facilitate this exchange (Farchy and Blas 2021). Political considerations also dominated trade. For example,
after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, US President
Jimmy Carter imposed a partial embargo on US grain
exports to the Soviet Union.3 The embargo, however,
was ineffective due to the global nature of grain markets. While Soviet imports of US wheat fell sharply,
they were replaced by imports from other countries,
especially Argentina (Oki 2008).
Commodity market embargoes have often been
used to apply political pressure. The Arab members of
the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) initiated an export embargo against the
United States and other countries in 1973 during the
Arab-Israeli war and announced a 25 percent cut in
output. Oil prices more than quadrupled between September 1973 and January 1974. The oil market was
significantly disrupted; however, the disruption was
short-lived, as traders diverted oil to embargoed countries and production from non-OPEC countries rose
(McNally 2017). Importers also took steps to reduce
vulnerability, for example, by mandating efficiency
improvements and creating strategic oil inventories
(Baffes and Nagle 2022).
Another embargo example is that of South Africa
during apartheid. Several governments implemented
wide-ranging bans on exports to South Africa, particularly crude oil. However, sanctions were blunted by
traders who were willing to risk violating sanctions
to supply oil at high prices (Farchy and Blas 2021).
Overall, the historical examples showcase the ability of
fungible commodities to find their way from producers to consumers, absent near-absolute trade barriers.
3In 1980, the Soviet Union planned to import 35 million
metric tons of grain—25 million of that from the United States.
It ended up importing only 8 million tons, committed to under
a previous treaty (JEC 1980).

Fragmentation and Commodity Markets: Vulnerabilities and Risks

Box 3.3. The Uneven Economic Effects of Commodity Market Fragmentation
Fragmentation of commodity markets affects countries
and households differently. This box demonstrates that
low-income countries are more vulnerable in the event
of fragmentation, especially of agricultural commodities,
owing to their greater reliance on food imports. The finding raises important food security concerns should further
fragmentation materialize.
To quantify the impact on long-term GDP of
fragmentating trade in multiple commodities simultaneously, a multicountry, multisector trade model is
used in this box, following Caliendo and Parro (2015).
Bolhuis, Chen, and Kett (2023) augment the model
to account for trade and production of 133 commodities across 145 countries. Labor is the only factor of
production, and productivity is exogenous. Commodities are used as intermediate inputs, with a long-term
supply elasticity of 1. The model accounts for the
input-output structure of global trade and assumes low

and Benjamin Kett. See Bolhuis, Chen, and Kett (2023) for
further details.

elasticity of substitution between commodities and
other inputs in the production of manufactured goods.
Trade costs are set such that there is no commodity
trade between blocs.
Results show that the aggregate impact of commodity fragmentation would be moderate, with a global
GDP loss of 0.3 percent (Figure 3.3.1). However,
there would be large differences within and across
blocs. Some economies might benefit from trade diversion as competitors lose access to export markets. Most
would experience permanent output declines. Losses
would be larger in countries where commodity trade
with the other bloc was significant. The China-Russia+
bloc and low-income countries—whose economies are
more commodity-intensive—would lose more.
Low-income countries’ high dependence on imports
of agricultural goods would make them particularly
vulnerable (Figure 3.3.2). Disrupting trade in food
commodities alone would lead to losses of 1 percent of
GDP. Commodity fragmentation could also have high
social and humanitarian costs and would be particularly harmful for lower-income households, which
spend a large share of their incomes on food and fuel.

STATISTICAL APPENDIX

T

he Statistical Appendix presents historical
data as well as projections. It comprises
eight sections: Assumptions, What’s
New, Data and Conventions, Country
Notes, Classification of Countries, General Features
and Composition of Groups in the World Economic
Outlook Classification, Key Data Documentation, and
Statistical Tables.
The first section summarizes the assumptions underlying the estimates and projections for
2023–24. The second section briefly describes the
changes to the database and statistical tables since
the April 2023 World Economic Outlook (WEO). The
third section offers a general description of the data
and the conventions used for calculating country group composites. The fourth section presents
selected key information for each country. The fifth
section summarizes the classification of countries in
the various groups presented in the WEO, and the
sixth section explains that classification in further
detail. The seventh section provides information on
methods and reporting standards for the member
countries’ national account and government finance
indicators included in the report.
The last, and main, section comprises the statistical tables. Statistical Appendix A is included
here; Statistical Appendix B is available online at
www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO.
Data in these tables have been compiled on the
basis of information available through September 25,
2023. The figures for 2023–24 are shown with the
same degree of precision as the historical figures solely
for convenience; because they are projections, the same
degree of accuracy is not to be inferred.

Assumptions
Real effective exchange rates for the advanced
economies are assumed to remain constant at their
average levels measured during July 25, 2023–
August 22, 2023. For 2023 and 2024 these assumptions imply average US dollar–special drawing right
conversion rates of 1.340 and 1.340, US dollar–euro

conversion rates1 of 1.088 and 1.094, and yen–
US dollar conversion rates of 139.1 and 143.1,
respectively.
It is assumed that the price of oil will average $80.49
a barrel in 2023 and $79.92 a barrel in 2024.
National authorities’ established policies are assumed
to be maintained. Box A1 describes the more specific
policy assumptions underlying the projections for
selected economies.
With regard to interest rates, it is assumed that the
three-month government bond yield for the United States
will average 5.3 percent in 2023 and 5.4 percent in
2024, that for the euro area will average 3.0 percent
in 2023 and 3.2 percent in 2024, and that for Japan
will average –0.2 percent in 2023 and –0.1 percent in
2024. Further it is assumed that the 10-year government bond yield for the United States will average
3.8 percent in 2023 and 4.0 percent in 2024, that for
the euro area will average 2.4 percent in 2023 and
2.6 percent in 2024, and that for Japan will average
0.5 percent in 2023 and 0.6 percent in 2024.

What’s New
• Ecuador’s fiscal sector projections, which were previously omitted due to ongoing program discussions,
are now included.
• Eritrea’s data and projections for 2020–28 are excluded
from the database due to constraints in data reporting.
• Sri Lanka’s projections for 2023–28 are excluded
from publication owing to ongoing discussions on
sovereign debt restructuring.
• Ukraine’s projections for 2024–28, in line with the
program’s baseline scenario, are now included.
• For West Bank and Gaza, certain projections for
2022–28 are excluded from publication pending
methodological adjustments to statistical series.
1 In regard to the introduction of the euro, on December 31,
1998, the Council of the European Union decided that, effective
January 1, 1999, the irrevocably fixed conversion rates between the
euro and currencies of the member countries adopting the euro are
as described in Box 5.4 of the October 1998 WEO. See that box
as well for details on how the conversion rates were established. For
the most recent table of fixed conversion rates, see the Statistical
Appendix of the April 2023 WEO.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: NAVIGATING GLOBAL DIVERGENCES

Data and Conventions
Data and projections for 196 economies form the
statistical basis of the WEO database. The data are
maintained jointly by the IMF’s Research Department
and regional departments, with the latter regularly
updating country projections based on consistent
global assumptions.
Although national statistical agencies are the
ultimate providers of historical data and definitions,
international organizations are also involved in statistical issues, with the objective of harmonizing methodologies for the compilation of national statistics,
including analytical frameworks, concepts, definitions,
classifications, and valuation procedures used in the
production of economic statistics. The WEO database
reflects information from both national source agencies
and international organizations.
Most countries’ macroeconomic data as presented
in the WEO conform broadly to the 2008 version
of the System of National Accounts (SNA 2008). The
IMF’s sector statistical standards—the sixth edition of
the Balance of Payments and International Investment
Position Manual (BPM6), the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual and Compilation Guide, and the
Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014 (GFSM
2014)—have been aligned with the SNA 2008. These
standards reflect the IMF’s special interest in countries’
external positions, monetary developments, financial
sector stability, and public sector fiscal positions. The
process of adapting country data to the new standards
begins in earnest when the manuals are released. However, full concordance with the manuals is ultimately
dependent on the provision by national statistical
compilers of revised country data; hence, the WEO
estimates are only partly adapted to these manuals.
Nonetheless, for many countries, conversion to the
updated standards will have only a small impact on
major balances and aggregates. Many other countries
have partially adopted the latest standards and will
continue implementation over a number of years.2
The fiscal gross and net debt data reported in the
WEO are drawn from official data sources and IMF
staff estimates. While attempts are made to align gross
and net debt data with the definitions in the GFSM
2 Many countries are implementing the SNA 2008 or European
System of National and Regional Accounts 2010, and a few countries use versions of the SNA older than that from 1993. A similar
adoption pattern is expected for the BPM6 and GFSM 2014. Please
refer to Table G, which lists the statistical standards to which each
country adheres.

International Monetary Fund | October 2023

2014, as a result of data limitations or specific country
circumstances, these data can sometimes deviate from
the formal definitions. Although every effort is made to
ensure the WEO data are relevant and internationally
comparable, differences in both sectoral and instrument coverage mean that the data are not universally
comparable. As more information becomes available,
changes in either data sources or instrument coverage
can give rise to data revisions that are sometimes substantial. For clarification on the deviations in sectoral
or instrument coverage, please refer to the metadata for
the online WEO database.
Composite data for country groups in the WEO are
either sums or weighted averages of data for individual
countries. Unless noted otherwise, multiyear averages
of growth rates are expressed as compound annual rates
of change.3 Arithmetically weighted averages are used
for all data for the emerging market and developing
economies group—except data on inflation and money
growth, for which geometric averages are used. The
following conventions apply:
Country group composites for exchange rates, interest rates, and growth rates of monetary aggregates are
weighted by GDP converted to US dollars at market
exchange rates (averaged over the preceding three
years) as a share of group GDP.
Composites for other data relating to the domestic
economy, whether growth rates or ratios, are weighted
by GDP valued at purchasing power parity as a share
of total world or group GDP.4 For the aggregation of
world and advanced economies (and subgroups) inflation, annual rates are simple percentage changes from
the previous years; for the aggregation of emerging
market and developing economies (and subgroups)
inflation, annual rates are based on logarithmic
differences.
Composites for real GDP per capita in purchasingpower-parity terms are sums of individual country data
3 Averages for real GDP, inflation, GDP per capita, and commodity prices are calculated based on the compound annual rate of
change, except in the case of the unemployment rate, which is based
on the simple arithmetic average.
4 See Box 1.1 of the October 2020 WEO for a summary of the
revised purchasing-power-parity-based weights as well as “Revised
Purchasing Power Parity Weights” in the July 2014 WEO Update,

STATISTICAL APPENDIX

after conversion to international dollars in the years
indicated.
Unless noted otherwise, composites for all sectors
for the euro area are corrected for reporting discrepancies in transactions within the area. Unadjusted annual
GDP data are used for the euro area and for the majority of individual countries, except for Cyprus, Ireland,
Portugal, and Spain, which report calendar-adjusted
data. For data prior to 1999, data aggregations apply
1995 European currency unit exchange rates.
Composites for fiscal data are sums of individual
country data after conversion to US dollars at the average market exchange rates in the years indicated.
Composite unemployment rates and employment
growth are weighted by labor force as a share of group
labor force.
Composites relating to external sector statistics are
sums of individual country data after conversion to
US dollars at the average market exchange rates in the
years indicated for balance of payments data and at
end-of-year market exchange rates for debt denominated in currencies other than US dollars.
Composites of changes in foreign trade volumes and
prices, however, are arithmetic averages of percent changes
for individual countries weighted by the US dollar value
of exports or imports as a share of total world or group
exports or imports (in the preceding year).
Unless noted otherwise, group composites are
computed if 90 percent or more of the share of group
weights is represented.
Data refer to calendar years, except in the case of
a few countries that use fiscal years; Table F lists the
economies with exceptional reporting periods for
national accounts and government finance data.
For some countries, the figures for 2022 and earlier
are based on estimates rather than actual outturns;
Table G lists the latest actual outturns for the indicators in the national accounts, prices, government
finance, and balance of payments for each country.

Country Notes
Afghanistan: Data for 2021 and 2022 are estimates
and reported for selected indicators only, and projections for 2023–28 are omitted because of an unusually high degree of uncertainty given that the IMF
has paused its engagement with the country owing
to a lack of clarity within the international community regarding the recognition of a government in
Afghanistan.

Algeria: Total government expenditure and net lending/borrowing include net lending by the government,
which mostly reflects support to the pension system
and other public sector entities.
Argentina: The official national consumer price
index (CPI) starts in December 2016. For earlier
periods, CPI data for Argentina reflect the Greater
Buenos Aires Area CPI (prior to December 2013); the
national CPI (IPCNu, December 2013 to October
2015); the City of Buenos Aires CPI (November
2015 to April 2016); and the Greater Buenos Aires
Area CPI (May 2016 to December 2016). Given
limited comparability of these series because of differences in geographical coverage, weights, sampling,
and methodology, the WEO does not report average
CPI inflation for 2014–16 and end-of-period inflation for 2015–16. Also, Argentina discontinued the
publication of labor market data starting in the fourth
quarter of 2015, and new series became available
starting in the second quarter of 2016.
Bangladesh: Data and forecasts are presented on a
fiscal year basis. However, country group aggregates
that include Bangladesh use calendar year estimates of
real GDP and purchasing-power-parity GDP.
Costa Rica: The central government definition has
been expanded as of January 1, 2021, to include 51
public entities as per Law 9524. Data back to 2019 are
adjusted for comparability.
Dominican Republic: The fiscal series have the
following coverage: public debt, debt service, and
the cyclically adjusted/structural balances are for the
consolidated public sector (which includes the central
government, the rest of the nonfinancial public sector,
and the central bank); the remaining fiscal series are
for the central government.
Eritrea: Data and projections for 2020–28 are
excluded from the database due to constraints in data
reporting.
India: Real GDP growth rates are calculated
as per national accounts: for 1998 to 2011 with
base year 2004/05 and, thereafter, with base year
2011/12.
Iran: Historical figures of nominal GDP in US dollars are computed using the official exchange rate up to
2017. From 2018 onward, the NIMA exchange rate,
rather than the official exchange rate, is now used to
convert nominal rial GDP figures into US dollars. The
IMF staff assesses that the NIMA rate better reflects
the transaction-value-weighted exchange rate in the
economy over that period of time.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: NAVIGATING GLOBAL DIVERGENCES

Italy: Data and forecasts reflect information available
through September 21, 2023.
Lebanon: Data for 2021–22 are IMF staff estimates
and not provided by the national authorities. Projections for 2023–28 are omitted owing to an unusually
high degree of uncertainty.
Libya: Projections do not include the impact of the
floods which occurred in September 2023.
Sierra Leone: Although the currency was redenominated on July 1, 2022, local currency data are
expressed in the old leone for the October 2023 WEO.
Sri Lanka: Projections for 2023–28 are excluded
from publication owing to ongoing discussions on
sovereign debt restructuring.
Sudan: Projections reflect staff’s analysis based on the
assumption that the conflict will end by the end of 2023.
Syria: Data are excluded from 2011 onward because
of the uncertain political situation.
Türkiye: The projections are based on information
available as of September 8, 2023, and do not fully
incorporate a policy rate increase and additional quantitative tightening made after that date.
Turkmenistan: Real GDP data are IMF staff estimates compiled in line with international methodologies (SNA), using official estimates and sources as well
as United Nations and World Bank databases. Estimates of and projections for the fiscal balance exclude
receipts from domestic bond issuances as well as privatization operations, in line with the GFSM 2014. The
authorities’ official estimates for fiscal accounts, which
are compiled using domestic statistical methodologies,
include bond issuance and privatization proceeds as
part of government revenues.
Ukraine: Revised national accounts data are available
beginning in 2000 and exclude Crimea and Sevastopol
from 2010 onward.
United Kingdom: Projections do not incorporate
the significant statistical upward revisions to 2020 and
2021 GDP that were previewed on September 1, 2023
(with a release date of September 29, 2023).
Uruguay: In December 2020 the authorities began
reporting the national accounts data according to the
SNA 2008, with the base year 2016. The new series
begin in 2016. Data prior to 2016 reflect the IMF
staff’s best effort to preserve previously reported data
and avoid structural breaks.
Since October 2018 Uruguay’s public pension
system has been receiving transfers in the context of
law 19,590 that compensates persons affected by the
creation of the mixed pension system. These funds are
96

International Monetary Fund | October 2023

recorded as revenues, consistent with the IMF’s methodology. Therefore, data and projections for 2018–22
are affected by these transfers, which amounted to 1.2
percent of GDP in 2018, 1.1 percent of GDP in 2019,
0.6 percent of GDP in 2020, 0.3 percent of GDP in
2021, 0.1 percent of GDP in 2022, and 0 percent
thereafter. See IMF Country Report 19/64 for further
details.5 The disclaimer about the public pension
system applies only to the revenues and net lending/
borrowing series.
The coverage of the fiscal data for Uruguay was
changed from consolidated public sector to nonfinancial
public sector with the October 2019 WEO. In Uruguay,
nonfinancial public sector coverage includes the central
government, local government, social security funds,
nonfinancial public corporations, and Banco de Seguros
del Estado. Historical data were also revised accordingly.
Under this narrower fiscal perimeter—which excludes
the central bank—assets and liabilities held by the
nonfinancial public sector for which the counterpart
is the central bank are not netted out in debt figures.
In this context, capitalization bonds issued in the past
by the government to the central bank are now part of
the nonfinancial public sector debt. Gross and net debt
estimates for 2008–11 are preliminary.
Venezuela: Projecting the economic outlook, including assessing past and current economic developments
used as the basis for the projections, is rendered difficult by the lack of discussions with the authorities
(the most recent Article IV consultation took place
in 2004), incomplete metadata of limited reported
statistics, and difficulties in reconciling reported indicators with economic developments. The fiscal accounts
include the budgetary central government; social
security; FOGADE (insurance deposit institution); and
a reduced set of public enterprises, including Petróleos
de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA). Following some methodological upgrades to achieve a more robust nominal
GDP, historical data and indicators expressed as a percentage of GDP have been revised from 2012 onward.
For most indicators, data for 2018–22 are IMF staff
estimates. The effects of hyperinflation and the paucity
of reported data mean that the IMF staff’s projected
macroeconomic indicators should be interpreted with
caution. Broad uncertainty surrounds these projections. Venezuela’s consumer prices are excluded from
all WEO group composites.

STATISTICAL APPENDIX

West Bank and Gaza: Certain projections for
2022–28 are excluded from publication pending
­methodological adjustments to statistical series.
Zimbabwe: Authorities have recently finished redenominating their national accounts statistics following the
introduction in 2019 of the Real Time Gross Settlement
dollar, later renamed the Zimbabwe dollar. The Zimbabwe dollar previously ceased circulating in 2009, and during 2009–19 Zimbabwe operated under a multicurrency
regime with the US dollar as the unit of account.

Classification of Countries
Summary of the Country Classification
The country classification in the WEO divides the
world into two major groups: advanced economies
and emerging market and developing economies.6 This
classification is not based on strict criteria, economic or
otherwise, and has evolved over time. The objective is
to facilitate analysis by providing a reasonably meaningful method of organizing data. Table A provides
an overview of the country classification, showing
the number of countries in each group by region and
summarizing some key indicators of their relative size
(GDP valued at purchasing power parity, total exports
of goods and services, and population).
Some countries remain outside the country classification and therefore are not included in the analysis.
Cuba and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea
are examples of countries that are not IMF members, and the IMF therefore does not monitor their
economies.

General Features and Composition of Groups in
the World Economic Outlook Classification
Advanced Economies
Table B lists the 41 advanced economies. The seven
largest in terms of GDP based on market exchange
rates—the United States, Japan, Germany, France,
Italy, the United Kingdom, and Canada—constitute
the subgroup of major advanced economies, often
referred to as the Group of Seven. The members of the
euro area are also distinguished as a subgroup. Composite data shown in the tables for the euro area cover
6 As

used here, the terms “country” and “economy” do not always
refer to a territorial entity that is a state as understood by international law and practice. Some territorial entities included here are
not states, although their statistical data are maintained on a separate
and independent basis.

the current members for all years, even though the
membership has increased over time.
Table C lists the member countries of the European
Union, not all of which are classified as advanced
economies in the WEO.

Emerging Market and Developing Economies
The group of emerging market and developing
economies (155) comprises all those that are not classified as advanced economies.
The regional breakdowns of emerging market and
developing economies are emerging and developing
Asia; emerging and developing Europe (sometimes
also referred to as “central and eastern Europe”);
Latin America and the Caribbean; Middle East and
Central Asia (which comprises the regional subgroups
Caucasus and Central Asia; and Middle East, North
Africa, Afghanistan, and Pakistan); and sub-Saharan
Africa.
Emerging market and developing economies are also
classified according to analytical criteria that reflect
the composition of export earnings and a distinction
between net creditor and net debtor economies. Tables
D and E show the detailed composition of emerging
market and developing economies in the regional and
analytical groups.
The analytical criterion source of export earnings
distinguishes between the categories fuel (Standard
International Trade Classification [SITC] 3) and
nonfuel and then focuses on nonfuel primary products
(SITCs 0, 1, 2, 4, and 68). Economies are categorized
into one of these groups if their main source of export
earnings exceeded 50 percent of total exports on average between 2018 and 2022.
The financial and income criteria focus on net creditor economies, net debtor economies, heavily indebted
poor countries (HIPCs), low-income developing countries
(LIDCs), and emerging market and middle-income
economies (EMMIEs). Economies are categorized as net
debtors when their latest net international investment
position, where available, was less than zero or their
current account balance accumulations from 1972
(or earliest available data) to 2022 were negative. Net
debtor economies are further differentiated on the basis
of experience with debt servicing.7
7 During 2018–22, 39 economies incurred external payments
arrears or entered into official or commercial bank debt-rescheduling
agreements. This group is referred to as economies with arrears and/or
rescheduling during 2018–22.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: NAVIGATING GLOBAL DIVERGENCES

The HIPC group comprises the countries that
are or have been considered by the IMF and the
World Bank for participation in their debt initiative known as the HIPC Initiative, which aims to
reduce the external debt burdens of all the eligible
HIPCs to a “sustainable” level in a reasonably short
period of time.8 Many of these countries have already

Enhanced HIPC Initiative,” IMF Pamphlet Series 51 (Washington,
DC: International Monetary Fund, November 1999).

International Monetary Fund | October 2023

benefited from debt relief and have graduated from
the initiative.
The LIDCs are countries that have per capita
income levels below a certain threshold (set at $2,700
in 2016 as measured by the World Bank’s Atlas
method), structural features consistent with limited
development and structural transformation, and
external financial linkages insufficiently close for them
to be widely seen as emerging market economies.
The EMMIEs group comprises emerging market
and developing economies that are not classified as
LIDCs.

STATISTICAL APPENDIX

Box A1. Economic Policy Assumptions underlying the Projections for Selected Economies
Fiscal Policy Assumptions
The short-term fiscal policy assumptions used in
the World Economic Outlook (WEO) are normally
based on officially announced budgets, adjusted
for differences between the national authorities and the IMF staff regarding macroeconomic
assumptions and projected fiscal outturns. When
no official budget has been announced, projections
incorporate policy measures judged likely to be
implemented. The medium-term fiscal projections
are similarly based on a judgment about policies’
most likely path. For cases in which the IMF staff
has insufficient information to assess the authorities’ budget intentions and prospects for policy
implementation, an unchanged structural primary
balance is assumed unless indicated otherwise.
Specific assumptions used in regard to some of the
advanced economies follow. (See also Tables B5 to
B9 in the online section of the Statistical Appendix for data on fiscal net lending/borrowing and
structural balances.)1
Argentina: Fiscal projections are based on the
available information regarding budget outturn,
budget plans, and IMF-supported program targets
for the federal government; on fiscal measures
announced by the authorities; and on IMF staff
macroeconomic projections.
Australia: Fiscal projections are based on data
from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the fiscal year (FY)2023/24 budgets published by the
Commonwealth government and the respective
1 The output gap is actual minus potential output, as a
percentage of potential output. Structural balances are expressed
as a percentage of potential output. The structural balance is the
actual net lending/borrowing minus the effects of cyclical output
from potential output, corrected for one-time and other factors,
such as asset and commodity prices and output composition
effects. Changes in the structural balance consequently include
effects of temporary fiscal measures, the impact of fluctuations in
interest rates and debt-service costs, and other noncyclical fluctuations in net lending/borrowing. The computations of structural balances are based on the IMF staff’s estimates of potential
GDP and revenue and expenditure elasticities. (See Annex I of
the October 1993 WEO.) Estimates of the output gap and of
the structural balance are subject to significant margins of uncertainty. Net debt is calculated as gross debt minus financial assets
corresponding to debt instruments.

state/territory governments, and the IMF staff’s
estimates and projections.
Austria: Fiscal projections are based on the
2023 budget and the April 2023 Austria Stability
Programme. The NextGenerationEU fund and the
latest announcement on fiscal measures have also
been incorporated.
Belgium: Projections are based on the Belgian
Stability Programme 2023–26, the 2023 Budgetary Plan, and other available information on the
authorities’ fiscal plans, with adjustments for the
IMF staff’s assumptions.
Brazil: Fiscal projections for 2023 reflect current
policies in place.
Canada: Projections use the baseline forecasts
from the Government of Canada’s 2023 budget and
the latest provincial budgets. The IMF staff makes
some adjustments to these forecasts, including
those for differences in macroeconomic projections.
The IMF staff’s forecast also incorporates the most
recent data releases from Statistics Canada’s National
Economic Accounts, including quarterly federal,
provincial, and territorial budgetary outturns.
Chile: Projections are based on the authorities’
budget projections, adjusted to reflect the IMF
staff’s projections for GDP, copper prices, depreciation, and inflation.
China: Staff fiscal projections incorporate the
2023 budget as well as estimates of off-budget
financing.
Denmark: Estimates for the current year are aligned
with the latest official budget numbers, adjusted
where appropriate for the IMF staff’s macroeconomic
assumptions. Beyond the current year, the projections
incorporate key features of the medium-term fiscal
plan as embodied in the authorities’ latest budget.
Structural balances are net of temporary fluctuations
in some revenues (for example, North Sea revenue,
pension yield tax revenue) and one-offs (COVID-19–
related one-offs are, however, included).
France: Projections for 2023 onward are based
on the 2018–23 budget laws, Stability Programme
2023–27, draft medium-term programming bill,
and other available information on the authorities’ fiscal plans, adjusted for differences in revenue

Box A1 (continued)
­ rojections and assumptions on macroeconomic
p
and financial variables.
Germany: The IMF staff’s projections for 2023
and beyond are based on the 2023 budget, the
2023 Stability Programme, the draft 2024 federal
budget, the federal government’s medium-term
budget plan, and data updates from the national
statistical agency (Destatis) and the ministry of
finance, adjusted for differences in the IMF staff’s
macroeconomic framework and assumptions concerning revenue elasticities.
Greece: Data since 2010 reflect adjustments in
line with the primary balance definition under the
enhanced surveillance framework for Greece.
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region: Projections are based on the authorities’ medium-term
fiscal projections for expenditures.
Hungary: Fiscal projections include the IMF staff’s
projections for the macroeconomic framework and
fiscal policy plans announced in the 2023 budget.
India: Projections are based on available information on the authorities’ fiscal plans, with adjustments for the IMF staff’s assumptions. Subnational
data are incorporated with a lag of up to one year;
general government data are thus finalized well after
central government data. IMF and Indian presentations differ, particularly regarding disinvestment and
license-auction proceeds, net versus gross recording
of revenues in certain minor categories, and some
public sector lending. Starting with FY2020/21
data, expenditure also includes the off-budget
component of food subsidies, consistent with the
revised treatment of food subsidies in the budget.
The IMF staff adjusts expenditure to take out payments for previous years’ food subsidies, which are
included as expenditure in budget estimates for
FY2020/21.
Indonesia: The IMF staff’s projections are based
on maintaining a neutral fiscal stance going forward,
accompanied by moderate tax policy and administration reforms, some expenditure realization,
and a gradual increase in capital spending over the
medium term in line with fiscal space.
Ireland: Fiscal projections are based on the country’s Budget 2023.

116

International Monetary Fund | October 2023

Italy: The IMF staff’s estimates and projections
are informed by the fiscal plans included in the
government’s 2023 budget and amendments. The
stock of maturing postal bonds is included in the
debt projections.
Japan: The projections reflect fiscal measures the
government has already announced, with adjustments for the IMF staff’s assumptions.
Korea: The forecast incorporates the overall fiscal balance in the 2022 annual budget and two
supplementary budgets, the proposed 2023 budget
and medium-term fiscal plan, and the IMF staff’s
adjustments.
Mexico: The 2020 public sector borrowing
requirements estimated by the IMF staff adjust for
some statistical discrepancies between above-the-line
and below-the-line numbers. Fiscal projections for
2023 and 2024 are informed by the estimates in
Criterios 2024; projections for 2025 onward assume
continued compliance with rules established in the
Federal Budget and Fiscal Responsibility Law.
The Netherlands: Fiscal projections for 2023–28
are based on the IMF staff’s forecast framework and
are also informed by the authorities’ draft budget
plan and Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis
projections.
New Zealand: Fiscal projections are based on the
FY2023/24 budget (May 2023) and the IMF staff’s
estimates.
Portugal: The projections for the current year are
based on the authorities’ approved budget, adjusted
to reflect the IMF staff’s macroeconomic forecast.
Projections thereafter are based on the assumption
of unchanged policies. Projections for 2023 reflect
information available in the 2023 budget proposal.
Puerto Rico: Fiscal projections are informed by
the Certified Fiscal Plan for the Commonwealth
of Puerto Rico, which was prepared in April 2023,
certified by the Financial Oversight and Management Board.
Russia: The fiscal rule was suspended last year
by the government in response to the sanctions
imposed after the invasion of Ukraine, allowing for
windfall oil and gas revenues above benchmark to
be used to finance a larger deficit in 2022. Savings

STATISTICAL APPENDIX

Box A1 (continued)
accumulated in the National Welfare Fund can
also now be used this way. A new fiscal rule will
become fully effective in 2025. The new rule allows
for higher oil and gas revenues to be spent, but it
simultaneously targets a smaller primary structural
deficit.
Saudi Arabia: The IMF staff’s baseline fiscal
projections are based primarily on its understanding of government policies as outlined in the 2022
budget. Export oil revenues are based on WEO
baseline oil price assumptions and the IMF staff’s
understanding of current oil policy under the
OPEC+ (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries, including Russia and other non-OPEC
oil exporters) agreement.
Singapore: FY2020 figures are based on budget
execution. FY2021 projections are based on revised
figures based on budget execution through the
end of 2021. FY2022 projections are based on the
initial budget of February 18, 2022. The IMF staff
assumes gradual withdrawal of remaining pandemicrelated measures and the implementation of various
revenue measures announced in the FY2022 budget
for the remainder of the projection period. These
include (1) an increase in the Goods and Services
Tax from 7 percent to 8 percent on January 1,
2023, and to 9 percent on January 1, 2024; (2) an
increase in property taxes in 2023 for non-owneroccupied properties (from 10 percent–20 percent
to 12 percent–36 percent) and for owner-occupied
properties with an annual value in excess of $30,000
(from 4 percent–16 percent to 6 percent–32 percent); and (3) an increase of the carbon tax from
S$5 a tonne to S$25 a tonne in 2024 and 2025 and
S$45 a tonne in 2026 and 2027.
South Africa: Fiscal assumptions are informed by
the 2023 budget. Nontax revenue excludes transactions in financial assets and liabilities, as they involve
primarily revenues associated with realized exchange
rate valuation gains from the holding of foreign
currency deposits, sale of assets, and conceptually
similar items.
Spain: Fiscal projections from 2023 onward
assume energy support measures amounting to
1 percent of GDP in 2023. Projections for

2021–26 reflect disbursements under the EU
Recovery and Resilience Facility.
Sweden: Fiscal estimates are based on the
authorities’ budget projections, adjusted to reflect
the IMF staff’s macroeconomic forecasts.
Switzerland: The projections assume that fiscal
policy is adjusted as necessary to keep fiscal balances in line with the requirements of Switzerland’s
fiscal rules.
Türkiye: The basis for the projections is the
IMF-defined fiscal balance, which excludes some
revenue and expenditure items that are included in
the authorities’ headline balance.
United Kingdom: Fiscal projections are based on
the March 2023 forecast from the Office for Budget
Responsibility (OBR) and the September 2023 release
on public sector finances from the Office for National
Statistics. The IMF staff’s projections take the OBR
forecast as a reference and overlay adjustments (for differences in assumptions) to both revenues and expenditures. The IMF staff’s forecasts do not necessarily
assume that the fiscal rules announced on November
17, 2022, will be met at the end of the forecast
period. Data are presented on a calendar year basis.
United States: Fiscal projections are based on the
May 2023 Congressional Budget Office baseline
and the latest Treasury monthly statement, adjusted
for the IMF staff’s policy and macroeconomic
assumptions. Projections incorporate the effects of
the Fiscal Responsibility Act.
Monetary Policy Assumptions
Monetary policy assumptions are based on the
established policy framework in each country. In
most cases, this implies a nonaccommodative stance
over the business cycle: official interest rates will
increase when economic indicators suggest that
inflation will rise above its acceptable rate or range;
they will decrease when indicators suggest inflation
will not exceed the acceptable rate or range, that
output growth is below its potential rate, and that
the margin of slack in the economy is significant.
With regard to interest rates, please refer to the
Assumptions section at the beginning of the
Statistical Appendix.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: NAVIGATING GLOBAL DIVERGENCES

Box A1 (continued)
Argentina: Monetary projections are consistent
with the overall macroeconomic framework, the fiscal
and financing plans, and the monetary and foreign
exchange policies under the crawling-peg regime.
Australia: Monetary policy assumptions are based
on the IMF staff’s analysis and the expected inflation path.
Brazil: Monetary policy assumptions are consistent with the convergence of inflation within the
relevant monetary policy horizon.
Canada: Projections reflect the gradual unwinding
monetary policy tightening by the Bank of Canada,
as inflation slowly goes back to its mid-range target
of 2 percent by early 2025.
Chile: Monetary policy assumptions are consistent with attaining the inflation target.
China: The overall monetary policy stance was
moderately accommodative in 2022 and is expected
to remain broadly accommodative in 2023.
Denmark: Monetary policy is to maintain the peg
to the euro.
Euro area: Monetary policy assumptions for euro
area member countries are drawn from a suite of
models (semi-structural, DSGE [dynamic stochastic
general equilibrium], Taylor rule), market expectations, and the European Central Bank Governing
Council communication.
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region: The
IMF staff assumes that the currency board system
will remain intact.
Hungary: The IMF staff’s estimates and projections are informed by expert judgment based on
recent developments.
India: Monetary policy projections are consistent
with achieving the Reserve Bank of India’s inflation
target over the medium term.

Note: The estimates in this table are based on individual countries’ national accounts and balance of payments statistics. Country group composites are calculated as the sum of the US dollar
values for the relevant individual countries. This differs from the calculations in the April 2005 and earlier issues of the World Economic Outlook, in which the composites were weighted by
GDP valued at purchasing power parities as a share of total world GDP. The estimates of gross national savings and investment (or gross capital formation) are from individual countries’
national accounts statistics. The estimates of the current account balance, the capital account balance, and the financial account balance (or net lending/net borrowing) are from the balance of
payments statistics. The link between domestic transactions and transactions with the rest of the world can be expressed as accounting identities. Savings (S) minus investment (I) is equal to
the current account balance (CAB) (S − I = CAB). Also, net lending/net borrowing (NLB) is the sum of the current account balance and the capital account balance (KAB) (NLB = CAB + KAB). In
practice, these identities do not hold exactly; imbalances result from imperfections in source data and compilation as well as from asymmetries in group composition due to data availability.
1See the country-specific notes for Italy and the United Kingdom in the “Country Notes” section of the Statistical Appendix.
2Excludes the Group of Seven (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, United States) and euro area countries.

IMF EXECUTIVE BOARD DISCUSSION OF THE OUTLOOK,
SEPTEMBER 2023

The following remarks were made by the Chair at the conclusion of the Executive Board’s discussion of the
Fiscal Monitor, Global Financial Stability Report, and World Economic Outlook on September 26, 2023.

E

xecutive Directors broadly agreed with staff’s
assessment of the global economic outlook,
risks, and policy priorities. They welcomed
the continued global economic resilience,
particularly of some advanced and emerging market
economies, but acknowledged that divergent growth
prospects across the world’s regions pose a challenge
to returning to pre-pandemic output trends. In
the case of many emerging market and developing
economies (EMDEs), the loss of momentum has
reduced prospects for income convergence. Directors
recognized that tight monetary policies, necessary to
fight inflation, and the withdrawal of fiscal policy
support to tackle soaring global debt and support
disinflation efforts are also headwinds to growth in
the short run. Most Directors agreed that increasing
geoeconomic fragmentation is also weighing on the
recovery and welcomed the Fund’s analysis on the
costs of fragmentation. A few Directors emphasized
that diversification in supply chains is important
to build resilience. More generally, a number of
Directors stressed that the Fund’s communication
on geoeconomic fragmentation should be balanced.
Directors generally agreed that ending Russia’s war
against Ukraine remains the single most impactful
action to improve the global outlook.
Directors broadly agreed that risks to the outlook
are more balanced relative to April 2023, but remain
tilted to the downside. While the acute stress in the
banking system seen in March this year has subsided,
in part due to swift action in Switzerland and the
United States, they broadly noted that financial
stability risks remain elevated. In particular, Directors
emphasized that persistence in global underlying
inflation could warrant higher-for-longer policy
rates, which could in turn trigger a correction in
financial markets and capital flow volatility. They also
considered that commodity prices could see more

volatility due to climate and geopolitical shocks. Most
Directors noted the risk of a further deterioration in
China’s property sector and, in this regard, welcomed
the recent policy actions taken by the authorities.
Directors also highlighted the risk of further debt
distress in those EMDEs heavily reliant on external
borrowing and generally indicated that the presence
of a weak tail of banks in some major economies also
poses vulnerabilities. Directors emphasized that should
financial conditions tighten abruptly, adverse feedback
loops could be triggered and again test the resilience of
the global financial system.
Directors noted that global core inflation remains
persistent and declining only slowly, and stressed
that monetary policy should maintain a restrictive
policy stance, tailored to country circumstances, until
inflation declines sustainably to target. They called
for clear and transparent communication to avoid
a de-anchoring of inflation expectations. Directors
also indicated that policies aimed at encouraging
labor market participation can help ease labor market
tightness in many advanced economies, which would
support disinflation.
Directors acknowledged that the fast pace of
monetary policy tightening adds further pressure
on the financial sector, requiring careful monitoring
of risks, better risk assessment and strengthened
supervision, and closing supervision gaps in the
nonbank financial sector. They called for an assessment
of how consistently international standards in banking
regulation were implemented during recent financial
stresses. Noting vulnerabilities in the commercial real
estate sector of some countries, Directors called for
continued vigilance and close monitoring.
Directors stressed the need to gradually tighten fiscal
policies as deficits and debt remain elevated. They
considered that, although the primary responsibility
for restoring price stability lies with central banks,

International Monetary Fund | October 2023

161

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Navigating Global Divergences

tightening the fiscal stance can further ease inflation
by reducing aggregate demand and reinforcing the
overall credibility of disinflation strategies. Directors
recommended mobilizing revenues through tax
capacity building and achieving efficiency gains in
spending to help restore some fiscal space, while
safeguarding targeted measures to protect the most
vulnerable. They also noted that some countries in
debt distress may require preemptive and orderly
debt restructuring, underscoring the importance of
multilateral cooperation in this regard.
Directors expressed concern over the dimming
growth prospects for the medium term. In this
context, they emphasized the importance of facilitating
investment and of targeted and carefully sequenced
supply-side reforms, which can enhance productivity
growth despite constrained policy space and help
dampen inflationary pressures.
Directors called for accelerating decarbonization
efforts, while noting that the policy mix will need
to strike a balance between climate goals, fiscal
sustainability, and political feasibility. They agreed that
relying mostly on spending-based measures will be
costly and instead favored a combination of revenue,
expenditure, and other financing and structural
policies to deliver on climate goals. In this context,
most Directors agreed that a policy package containing
carbon pricing, complemented with measures to
address market failures, catalyze private finance and
green investment, and mitigate distributional concerns
has higher chances to deliver on climate goals and

162

International Monetary Fund | October 2023

maintain debt sustainability. Some Directors reiterated,
however, that carbon pricing is not an adequate
solution in all countries. Directors acknowledged that
the green transition will be challenging, particularly
for EMDEs with high debt and sizable investment
needs; at the same time, delaying the transition will
only increase its costs. They generally agreed that
incorporating climate change considerations into debt
sustainability analyses could improve policy planning,
while taking into consideration country-specific
characteristics.
Directors underscored that internationally
coordinated efforts are indispensable to minimize the
cost of decarbonization, especially for low-income
countries and small developing states. In this context,
they highlighted the important catalytic role that
the Resilience and Sustainability Trust could play in
attracting green financing and investments. Directors
stressed that green industrial policies should avoid
distortions to trade and investment flows, in line with
the rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO). In
this context, a few Directors emphasized that measures
such as carbon border adjustment mechanisms should
also be WTO-compliant to safeguard international
trade. While they considered that, in principle, green
and food corridor agreements could help safeguard
the energy transition and avert food insecurity, a few
Directors underscored the difficulty of implementing
these mechanisms. More generally, Directors
emphasized that safeguarding the rules-based trading
system would be important for global prosperity.
