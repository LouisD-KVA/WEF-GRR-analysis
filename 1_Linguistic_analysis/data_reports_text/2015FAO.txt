monitoring period for the Millennium
Development Goal targets. For the
developing regions as a whole, the share
of undernourished people in the total
population has decreased from 23.3 percent
in 1990–92 to 12.9 per cent. Some regions,
such as Latin America, the east and southeastern regions of Asia, the Caucasus and
Central Asia, and the northern and western
regions of Africa have made fast progress.
Progress was also recorded in southern Asia,
Oceania, the Caribbean and southern and
eastern Africa, but at too slow a pace to reach
the MDG 1c target of halving the proportion
of the chronically undernourished.

J Economic growth is a key success factor
for reducing undernourishment, but it has
to be inclusive and provide opportunities
for improving the livelihoods of the poor.
Enhancing the productivity and incomes of
smallholder family farmers is key to progress.
J Social protection systems have been critical
in fostering progress towards the MDG 1
hunger and poverty targets in a number
of developing countries. Social protection
directly contributes to the reduction of
poverty, hunger and malnutrition by
promoting income security and access to
better nutrition, health care and education.
By improving human capacities and mitigating
the impacts of shocks, social protection fosters
the ability of the poor to participate in growth
through better access to employment.
J In many countries that have failed to reach
the international hunger targets, natural and
human-induced disasters or political instability
have resulted in protracted crises with
increased vulnerability and food insecurity of
large parts of the population. In such contexts,
measures to protect vulnerable population
groups and improve livelihoods have been
difficult to implement or ineffective.

his year´s annual State of Food Insecurity in the World report takes stock of progress made
towards achieving the internationally established hunger targets, and reflects on what needs
to be done, as we transition to the new post-2015 Sustainable Development Agenda.
United Nations member states have made two major commitments to tackle world hunger.
The first was at the World Food Summit (WFS), in Rome in 1996, when 182 governments
committed “... to eradicate hunger in all countries, with an immediate view to reducing the
number of undernourished people to half their present level no later than 2015”. The second
was the formulation of the First Millennium Development Goal (MDG 1), established in 2000 by
the United Nations members, which includes among its targets “cutting by half the proportion of
people who suffer from hunger by 2015”.
In this report, we review progress made since 1990 for every country and region as well as for
the world as a whole. First, the good news: overall, the commitment to halve the percentage of
hungry people, that is, to reach the MDG 1c target, has been almost met at the global level.
More importantly, 72 of the 129 countries monitored for progress have reached the MDG target,
29 of which have also reached the more ambitious WFS goal by at least halving the number of
undernourished people in their populations.
Marked differences in progress occur not only among individual countries, but also across
regions and subregions. The prevalence of hunger has been reduced rapidly in Central, Eastern
and South-Eastern Asia as well as in Latin America; in Northern Africa, a low level has been
maintained throughout the MDG and WFS monitoring periods. Other regions, including the
Caribbean, Oceania and Western Asia, saw some overall progress, but at a slower pace. In two
regions, Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, progress has been slow overall, despite many
success stories at country and subregional levels. In many countries that have achieved modest
progress, factors such as war, civil unrest and the displacement of refugees have often frustrated
efforts to reduce hunger, sometimes even raising the ranks of the hungry.
Progress towards the MDG 1c target, however, is assessed not only by measuring
undernourishment, or hunger, but also by a second indicator – the prevalence of underweight
children under five years of age. Progress for the two indicators was similar, but slightly faster in
the case of undernourishment. While both indicators have moved in parallel for the world as a
whole, they diverge significantly at the regional level owing to the different determinants of child
underweight.
Overall progress notwithstanding, hunger remains an everyday challenge for almost
795 million people worldwide, including 780 million in the developing regions. Hence, hunger
eradication should remain a key commitment of decision-makers at all levels.
In this year’s State of Food Insecurity of the World, we not only estimate the progress already
achieved, but also identify remaining problems, and offer recommendations for how these can be
addressed. In a nutshell, there is no “one-size-fits-all” solution. Interventions must be tailored to
conditions, including food availability and access, as well as longer-term development prospects.
Approaches need to be appropriate and comprehensive, with the requisite political commitment
to secure success.
Much work, therefore, remains to be done to eradicate hunger and achieve food security
across all its dimensions. This report identifies key factors that have determined success to date in
reaching the MDG 1c hunger target, and provides guidance on which policies should be
emphasized in the future.
Inclusive growth provides opportunities for those with meagre assets and skills, and improves
the livelihoods and incomes of the poor, especially in agriculture. It is therefore among the most
effective tools for fighting hunger and food insecurity, and for attaining sustainable progress.
Enhancing the productivity of resources held by smallholder family farmers, fisherfolk and forest
communities, and promoting their rural economic integration through well-functioning markets,
are essential elements of inclusive growth.
Social protection contributes directly to the reduction of hunger and malnutrition.
By increasing human capacities and promoting income security, it fosters local economic
development and the ability of the poor to secure decent employment and thus partake of
economic growth. There are many “win-win” situations to be found linking family farming and
social protection. They include institutional purchases from local farmers to supply school meals

and government programmes, and cash transfers or cash-for-work programmes that allow
communities to buy locally produced food.
During protracted crises, due to conflicts and natural disasters, food insecurity and
malnutrition loom even larger. These challenges call for strong political commitment and effective
actions.
More generally, progress in the fight against food insecurity requires coordinated and
complementary responses from all stakeholders. As heads of the three Rome-based food and
agriculture agencies, we have been and will continue to be at the forefront of these efforts,
working together to support member states, their organizations and other stakeholders to
overcome hunger and malnutrition.
Major new commitments to hunger reduction have recently been taken at the regional level –
the Hunger-Free Latin America and the Caribbean Initiative, Africa’s Renewed Partnership to End
Hunger by 2025, the Zero Hunger Initiative for West Africa, the Asia-Pacific Zero Hunger
Challenge, and pilot initiatives of Bangladesh, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Myanmar,
Nepal and Timor-Leste, among other countries. Further initiatives are in the making to eradicate
hunger by the year 2025 or 2030.
These efforts deserve and have our unequivocal support to strengthen national capacities and
capabilities to successfully develop and deliver the needed programmes. Advances since 1990
show that making hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition history is possible. They also show
that there is a lot of work ahead if we are to transform that vision into reality. Political
commitment, partnership, adequate funding and comprehensive actions are key elements of this
effort, of which we are active partners.
As dynamic members of the United Nations system, we shall support national and other
efforts to make hunger and malnutrition history through the Zero Hunger Challenge, the 2014
Rome Declaration on Nutrition and the post-2015 Sustainable Development Agenda.

rogress continues in the fight against hunger, yet an
unacceptably large number of people still lack the food
they need for an active and healthy life. The latest
available estimates indicate that about 795 million people in
the world – just over one in nine – were undernourished in
2014–16 (Table 1). The share of undernourished people in the

population, or the prevalence of undernourishment (PoU),1
has decreased from 18.6 percent in 1990–92 to 10.9 percent
in 2014–16, reflecting fewer undernourished people in a
growing global population. Since 1990–92, the number of
undernourished people has declined by 216 million globally,
a reduction of 21.4 percent, notwithstanding a 1.9 billion

increase in total population over the same period. The vast
majority of the hungry live in the developing regions,2 where
an estimated 780 million people were undernourished in
2014–16 (Table 1). The PoU, standing at 12.9 percent in
2014–16, has fallen by 44.5 percent since 1990–92.
Changes in large populous countries, notably China and
India, play a large part in explaining the overall hunger
reduction trends in the developing regions.3 Rapid progress
was achieved during the 1990s, when the developing
regions as a whole experienced a steady decline in both the
number of undernourished and the PoU (Figure 1). This was
followed by a slowdown in the PoU in the early 2000s before
a renewed acceleration in the latter part of the decade, with
the PoU falling from 17.3 percent in 2005–07 to
14.1 percent in 2010–12. Estimates for the most recent
period, partly based on projections, have again seen a phase
of slower progress, with the PoU declining to 12.9 percent
by 2014–16.

■■ Measuring global progress against targets
The year 2015 marks the end of the monitoring period for the
two internationally agreed targets for hunger reduction. The
first is the World Food Summit (WFS) goal. At the WFS, held
in Rome in 1996, representatives of 182 governments
pledged “... to eradicate hunger in all countries, with an
immediate view to reducing the number of undernourished
people to half their present level no later than 2015”.4 The
second is the Millennium Development Goal 1 (MDG 1)
hunger target. In 2000, 189 nations pledged to free people
from multiple deprivations, recognizing that every individual
has the right to dignity, freedom, equality and a basic
standard of living that includes freedom from hunger and
violence. This pledge led to the formulation of eight
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in 2001. The MDGs
were then made operational by the establishment of targets
and indicators to track progress, at national and global levels,
over a reference period of 25 years, from 1990 to 2015. The
first MDG, or MDG 1, includes three distinct targets: halving
global poverty, achieving full and productive employment and
decent work for all, and cutting by half the proportion of
people who suffer from hunger5 by 2015. FAO has monitored
progress towards the WFS and the MDG 1c hunger targets,
using the three-year period 1990–92 as the starting point.
The latest PoU estimates suggest that the developing
regions as a whole have almost reached the MDG 1c hunger
target. The estimated reduction in 2014–16 is less than one
percentage point away from that required to reach the
target by 2015 (Figure 1).6 Given this small difference, and
allowing for a margin of reliability of the background data
used to estimate undernourishment, the target can be
considered as having been achieved. However, as indicated
in the 2013 and 2014 editions of this report, meeting the
target exactly would have required accelerated progress in
recent years. Despite significant progress in many countries,

the needed acceleration does not seem to have materialized
in the developing regions as a whole.
The other target, set by the WFS in 1996, has been missed
by a large margin. Current estimates peg the number of
undernourished people in 1990–92 at a little less than a billion
in the developing regions. Meeting the WFS goal would have
required bringing this number down to about 515 million,
that is, some 265 million fewer than the current estimate for
2014–16 (Table 1). However, considering that the population
has grown by 1.9 billion since 1990–92, about two billion
people have been freed from a likely state of hunger over the
past 25 years.
Significant progress in fighting hunger over the past
decade should be viewed against the backdrop of a
challenging global environment: volatile commodity prices,
overall higher food and energy prices, rising unemployment
and underemployment rates and, above all, the global
economic recessions that occurred in the late 1990s and
again after 2008. Increasingly frequent extreme weather
events and natural disasters have taken a huge toll in terms
of human lives and economic damage, hampering efforts to
enhance food security. Political instability and civil strife have
added to this picture, bringing the number of displaced
persons globally to the highest level since the Second World
War. These developments have taken their toll on food
security in some of the most vulnerable countries, particularly

in sub-Saharan Africa, while other regions such as Eastern
and South-Eastern Asia, have remained unaffected or have
been able to minimize the adverse impacts.
The changing global economic environment has
challenged traditional approaches to addressing hunger.
Social safety nets and other measures that provide targeted
assistance to the most vulnerable population groups have
received growing attention. The importance of such targeted
measures, when combined with long-term and structural
interventions, lies in their ability to lead to a virtuous circle of
better nutrition and higher labour productivity. Direct
interventions are most effective when they target the most
vulnerable populations and address their specific needs,

improving the quality of their diet. Even where policies have
been successful in addressing large food-energy deficits,
dietary quality remains a concern. Southern Asia and subSaharan Africa remain particularly exposed to what has
become known as “hidden hunger” – the lack of, or
inadequate, intake of micronutrients, resulting in different
types of malnutrition, such as iron-deficiency anaemia and
vitamin A deficiency.
How the challenges posed by the global economic
environment affect individual regions, and the policies
adopted to counteract them, are discussed in greater detail in
the third section of this report, “Food security and nutrition:
the drivers of change (see pp. 26–42)”.

Wide differences persist among regions
Progress towards improved food security continues to be
uneven across regions. Some regions have made remarkably
rapid progress in reducing hunger, notably the Caucasus and
Central Asia, Eastern Asia, Latin America and Northern
Africa. Others, including the Caribbean, Oceania and
Western Asia, have also reduced their PoU, but at a slower
pace. Progress has also been uneven within these regions,
leaving significant pockets of food insecurity in a number of

countries. In two regions, Southern Asia and sub-Saharan
Africa, progress has been slow overall. While some countries
report successes in reducing hunger, undernourishment and
other forms of malnutrition remain at overall high levels in
these regions.
The different rates of progress across regions have
brought about changes in the regional distribution of
hunger since the early 1990s (Figure 2). Southern Asia and

sub-Saharan Africa now account for substantially larger
shares of global undernourishment.7 The shares for
Oceania and Western Asia also rose, albeit by much
smaller margins and from relatively low levels. In tandem,
faster-than-average progress in Eastern Asia and Latin
America and the Caribbean means that these regions now
account for much smaller shares of global
undernourishment.

■■ Progress towards the international hunger
targets
Figure 3 shows how the various developing regions fare with
respect to these targets. The estimates suggest that Africa as
a whole, and sub-Saharan Africa in particular, will not
achieve the MDG 1c target. Northern Africa, by contrast, has
reached the target.8 The more ambitious WFS goal, however,
appears to be out of reach for Africa as a whole, as well as
for all its subregions. Asia as a region has already achieved

the MDG 1c hunger target, but would need a further
reduction of about 140 million undernourished people to
reach the WFS goal – an achievement that is unlikely to
materialize in the near future. Latin America and the
Caribbean, considered together, have achieved both the
MDG 1c hunger target and the WFS goal in 2014–16. Finally,
Oceania has reached neither the MDG 1c hunger target nor
the WFS goal.
Some countries have met both international targets.
Based on the latest estimates, a total of 72 developing
countries have achieved the MDG 1c hunger target by 2014–
16 (Tables 2 and 3).9 Of these, 29 countries have also
reached the WFS goal. Another 31 developing countries
have reached only the MDG 1c hunger target, either by
reducing the PoU by 50 percent or more, or by bringing it
below 5 percent. Finally, a third group of 12 countries is also
categorized alongside those that have reached the MDG 1c
hunger target, as they have maintained their PoU close to or
below 5 percent since 1990–92.

■■ Sub-Saharan Africa: some success stories, but
the international hunger targets are far from
being met
In sub-Saharan Africa, just under one in every four people,
or 23.2 percent of the population, is estimated to be
undernourished in 2014–16 (Figure 4, p. 14). This is the
highest prevalence of undernourishment for any region and,
with about 220 million hungry people in 2014–16, the
second highest burden in absolute terms. In fact, the

12

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2015

number of undernourished people even increased by
44 million between 1990–92 and 2014–16. Taking into
account the region’s declining PoU (Table 1, p. 8), this
reflects the region’s remarkably high population growth rate
of 2.7 percent per year. The slow pace of progress in
fighting hunger over the years is particularly worrisome.
While the PoU fell relatively rapidly between 2000–02 and
2005–07, this pace slowed in subsequent years, reflecting
factors such as rising food prices, droughts and political
instability in several countries.

In the Central African subregion,10 the number of
undernourished people more than doubled between 1990–92
and 2014–16, while the PoU declined by 23.4 percent. The
divergence between the increase in absolute numbers and the
decline in the PoU is explained by the Central Africa’s rapid
population growth. The lack of progress in absolute terms
reflects prevailing problems in the subregion, notably political
instability, civil strife and outright war, as is the case in the
Central African Republic.
Eastern Africa remains the subregion with the biggest
hunger problem in absolute terms, being home to 124 million
undernourished people. As in Central Africa, the region
continues to experience rapid population growth. While the
share of undernourished has fallen by 33.2 percent, the
number of hungry people has risen by nearly 20 percent over
the MDG monitoring period. A more favourable picture
emerges in Southern Africa, where the PoU has fallen by
28 percent since 1990–92 and a little more than 3 million
people remain undernourished. The most successful subregion
in reducing hunger is Western Africa, where the number of
undernourished people has decreased by 24.5 percent since

1990–92, while the PoU is projected to be less than
10 percent in 2014–16. This success has been achieved
despite a combination of limiting factors, such as rapid
population growth – Nigeria is the most populated country in
the region – drought in the Sahel and the high food prices
experienced in recent years.
A total of 18 countries in sub-Saharan Africa have achieved
the MDG 1c hunger target, and four more are close to
reaching it (i.e. they are expected to do so before 2020 if
current trends persist). Of these, seven countries have also
achieved the more ambitious WFS goal (Angola, Cameroon,
Djibouti, Gabon, Ghana, Mali and Sao Tome and Principe),
and two more (South Africa and Togo) are close to doing so.
While these are welcome developments, progress mostly
started from high levels of undernourishment, and many of
these countries are still burdened with high hunger levels. The
more populous countries that have reached the MDG 1c
hunger target include Angola, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Ghana,
Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria and Togo. In addition, many
smaller countries, including Benin, the Gambia, Mauritius and
the Niger have reached MDG 1c. Others, including Chad,

Rwanda and Sierra Leone, are close to reaching the MDG 1c
hunger target, even if the hunger burden in these countries
remains high, both in relative and absolute terms. However,
most countries in sub-Saharan Africa show lack of progress
towards the international targets, and many countries,
including the Central African Republic and Zambia, still face
high PoU levels.
As discussed in more detail in the third section of this
report, “Food security and nutrition: the drivers of change”
(see pp. 26–42), many of the countries that have made good
progress in fighting hunger have enjoyed stable political
conditions, overall economic growth and expanding primary
sectors, mainly agriculture, fisheries and forestry. Many had
policies in place aimed at promoting and protecting access to
food. Moreover, many of these countries have experienced
high population growth rates, yet have still achieved the
MDG 1c target and even the WFS goal.11 This shows that
hunger reduction can be achieved even where populations are
increasing rapidly, if adequate policy and institutional
conditions are put in place. By contrast, countries where
progress has been insufficient or where hunger rates have
deteriorated are often characterized by weak agricultural
growth and inadequate social protection measures. Many are
in a state of protracted crisis. The number of such countries
extends beyond those for which data are provided in Table
A1. The lack of reliable information on food availability and
access prevents a sound analysis of the PoU for countries such
as Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea and

14

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2015

Somalia, hence their exclusion, but food security indicators for
which data are available suggest that their levels of
undernourishment remain very high.

■■ Northern Africa: international hunger targets
are met, despite potential instability
Trends and levels of undernourishment in Northern Africa are
very different from those in the rest of the continent. The
region has attained PoU levels below 5 percent according to
the projections for 2014–16 (Figure 4).12 The positions of
individual countries vis-à-vis the international hunger targets
are more or less consistent. While 5 percent of the population
can still amount to a considerable number of people in
Algeria, Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia, the generally low PoU
indicates that, based on current trends, the region is close to
eradicating severe food insecurity.
Subsidized access to food is a central policy element in the
region, with prices for basic foods remaining low in many
countries, even when world prices spiked. While the
sustainability of these measures can be questioned, they have
helped keep levels of undernourishment low, by supplying
large amount of calories affordably. The focus on calories,
however, has left dietary quality concerns largely unaddressed,
giving rise to other forms of malnutrition, including a rising
prevalence of overweight and obesity. Moreover, the region
remains exposed to potential and actual economic and
political instability. Some countries are heavily dependent on

Undernourishment around the world in 2015

food imports, and their limited resource base, coupled with
rapid population growth, suggests that import dependence
will remain a feature of the region in the future,
notwithstanding efforts to increase agricultural productivity.

■■ Southern Asia: some progress, but too slow to
meet the international hunger targets
The highest burden of hunger in absolute terms is to be found
in Southern Asia. Estimates for 2014–16 suggest that about
281 million people are undernourished in the region, marking
only a slight reduction from the number in 1990–92 (Table 1,
p. 8). But there has been noticeable progress in relative terms:
the PoU has declined from 23.9 percent in 1990–92 to
15.7 percent in 2014–16 (Figure 4). The region is on a
trajectory towards a more manageable hunger burden. Most
importantly, progress has accelerated over the last decade,
notwithstanding higher prices on international commodity
markets. The evolution of hunger trends in India, in particular,
has a significant influence on results for the region. Higher
world food prices, observed since the late 2000s, have not
been entirely transmitted into domestic prices, especially in
large countries such as India. In this country, the extended
food distribution programme also contributed to this positive
outcome. Higher economic growth has not been fully
translated into higher food consumption, let alone better diets
overall, suggesting that the poor and hungry may have failed
to benefit much from overall growth.
Most countries in Southern Asia have made progress
towards the international hunger targets, even if the pace
has been too slow for them to reach either the WFS or the
MDG targets, including, for example, Afghanistan, India,
Pakistan and Sri Lanka. As these countries constitute a large
share of the region’s population, they account for the low
overall performance – India still has the second-highest
estimated number of undernourished people in the world.
A notable exception in terms of performance is Bangladesh,
which has made faster progress and has already reached the
MDG 1c hunger target, thanks also to the comprehensive
National Food Policy framework adopted in the mid-2000s.
Nepal, also, has not only reached the MDG 1c hunger target,
but has almost reached the 5 percent threshold. One more
country in the region, the Islamic Republic of Iran, has
already brought the PoU below 5 percent, and has thus
reached the MDG 1c target.

■■ Eastern and South-Eastern Asia: rapid and
generalized progress towards the international
hunger targets
The most successful subregions in fighting hunger have been
Eastern and South-Eastern Asia. The number of
undernourished people in Eastern Asia has fallen from
295 million in 1990–92 to 145 million in 2014–16, a
50.9 percent reduction (Table 1, p. 8). Over the same period,

the PoU dropped from 23.2 percent at the beginning of the
monitoring period, to 9.6 percent in 2014–16, a reduction of
more than 60 percent (Figure 4).
In South-Eastern Asia, the number of undernourished
people has continued its steady decline, from 137.5 million in
1990–92 to 60.5 million by 2014–16, a 56 percent reduction
overall. The PoU has shrunk by a remarkable 68.5 percent,
falling from 30.6 percent in 1990–92 to less than 10 percent
in 2014–16. Most countries in South-Eastern Asia are making
rapid progress towards international targets. Cambodia,
Indonesia, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand and Viet Nam all account
for this positive performance. No country in the region shows
lack of progress with respect to the international targets.
Brunei Darussalam and Malaysia have reduced their PoU to
below the 5 percent threshold, which means they are close to
having eradicated hunger.
As discussed in more detail in the section “Food security
and nutrition: the drivers of change” (pp. 26–42), much of
the success of Eastern and South-Eastern Asia was possible
due to high overall economic growth. Unlike Southern Asia,
these subregions experienced more inclusive growth, with
more of the poor and vulnerable sharing the benefits. Rapid
productivity growth in agriculture, since the Green Revolution,
has boosted food availability and significantly improved access
to food for the rural poor.
China’s achievements in reducing hunger dominate the
overall performance of Eastern Asia. The country accounts for
almost two-thirds of the reduction in the number of
undernourished people in the developing regions between
1990–92 and 2014–16. China and the Republic of Korea have
achieved both the MDG 1c hunger target and the WFS goal.
Nevertheless, given the sheer size of its population, China is
still home to an estimated 134 million people facing hunger,
and the country with the highest number of undernourished
people. The prospects of continued growth, the increasing
orientation of the economy towards the domestic market, the
expansion of economic opportunities in internal areas of the
country and the growing ability of the poor to benefit from
these developments, have been and will continue to be key
factors in hunger reduction. Again, given its size, this also
holds at the regional level and has a marked influence on
global results. The only major exception to overall favourable
progress in the region is the Democratic People’s Republic of
Korea, which is burdened by continuously high levels of
undernourishment and shows little prospect of addressing its
problems any time soon.

■■ Caucasus and Central Asia: rapid recovery from
the transition to the market economy enabled
the international hunger targets to be met
A combination of factors accounts for progress in the
Caucasus and Central Asia, including rapid economic
growth, a resource-rich environment and remittances. After

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2015

15

Undernourishment around the world in 2015

a difficult transition in the early 1990s, often characterized
by political instability and economic austerity, economic
conditions have improved significantly and the political
situation has stabilized. This progress has translated into
lower hunger burdens throughout the region. Latest
estimates point to a steady decline in the PoU, which has
contracted from 14.1 percent in 1990–92 to 7.0 percent
for 2014–16 (Figure 4, p. 14). The number of
undernourished people is much lower than in other Asian
subregions – 5.8 million in 2014–16, down from 9.6 million
in 1990–92 (Table 1, p. 8).
Progress has been sufficiently rapid to enable both the
region as a whole and most countries to achieve the
MDG 1c hunger target. Indeed, most countries have
attained PoU levels close to, or below, the 5 percent
threshold. Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan and
Turkmenistan have achieved the WFS goal, while
Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan have achieved the MDG 1c
hunger target. The only country still lagging behind is
Tajikistan,13 which is making insufficient progress to reach
the international targets, and is burdened by a relatively
high PoU (33.2 percent in 2014–16).

■■ Western Asia: no progress towards the
international hunger targets, despite low
undernourishment levels in several countries
A less encouraging picture emerges from Western Asia,
where very different patterns can be observed. Some
countries, including Iraq and Yemen, show high levels of
food insecurity and have made slow progress towards
improving this situation. Most other countries, on the
contrary, have long since attained solid levels of food
security, after having brought undernourishment levels
below 5 percent. These include politically stable, resourcerich economies, such as Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United
Arab Emirates, together with Jordan, Lebanon and Oman –
all of which have achieved the MDG 1c hunger target;
Kuwait and Oman have also achieved the WFS goal. The
group also includes rapidly growing and politically stable
countries, such as Turkey. In Iraq and Yemen, as well as other
countries in the region for which no reliable information is
available, political instability, war and civil strife, as well as
fragile institutions, are the main factors underlying the lack
of progress.14
Despite a relatively low number of undernourished
people, Western Asia saw an increase in undernourishment
throughout the monitoring period: the PoU rose by
32.2 percent between 1990–92 and 2014–16, from 6.4 to
8.4 percent (Figure 4, p. 14). In parallel, rapid population
growth has brought about a dramatic increase in the number
of undernourished people, from 8 million to nearly
19 million. The region in its entirety, therefore, has not made
progress towards reaching either of the international hunger
targets, as a result of the polarized situation across countries.

16

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2015

■■ Latin America and the Caribbean: international
hunger targets have been met, due to rapid
progress in South America
In Latin America, the PoU has declined from 13.9 percent in
1990–92 to less than 5 percent in 2014–16 (Figure 4, p. 14).
In parallel, the number of undernourished people fell from
58 million to fewer than 27 million (Table 1, p. 8). As in most
regions, stark differences can be found across countries and
subregions. The Central American subregion, for instance,
saw much less progress compared with that of South America
and even Latin America overall. While South America has
been able to bring undernourishment down by more than
75 percent and eventually to below the 5 percent mark, the
PoU for Central America has declined by only 38.2 percent
over the MDG monitoring period.
Despite divergent developments within the region, Latin
America has achieved both the MDG 1c and WFS targets by
large margins. The overall achievements are to a large extent
also a reflection of robust progress in its most populous
countries. Good overall economic performance, steady output
growth in agriculture and successful social protection policies
are among the main correlates of progress in the region. The
combination of safety nets with special programmes for family
farmers and smallholders and targeted support to vulnerable
groups, together with broad-based food security interventions
such as school-feeding programmes, have contributed
significantly to improving food security in the region. At the
continental level, important commitments started in 2005
with the Hunger-Free Latin America and the Caribbean
Initiative and, through various other initiatives, eventually led
to the Plan for Food Security, Nutrition and Hunger
Eradication 2025 of the Community of Latin American and
Caribbean States (CELAC),15 adopted by all countries of the
region in January 2015 during its third Presidential Summit.
Hunger rates are currently below the 5 percent threshold
in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Mexico, Uruguay and
the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, and the WFS hunger
goal has been achieved in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Guyana,
Nicaragua, Peru, Uruguay and the Bolivarian Republic of
Venezuela. In all, 13 countries in Latin America have
achieved the MDG 1c hunger target. Beyond those listed
above, these include the Plurinational State of Bolivia,
Guyana, Panama, Peru and Suriname. Another four
countries, including Colombia, Ecuador, Honduras and
Paraguay, are on track to reach the MDG 1c target over the
next few years, if current trends persist. Even if some
countries, such as Guatemala or El Salvador, appear to be
off-track for reaching the international targets, no country in
the region has a PoU higher than 20 percent.
The Caribbean as a whole, like Central America, has failed
to meet the MDG 1c target. Unlike Central America, however,
the remaining hunger burden in almost all Caribbean
countries is lower and thus more manageable. The PoU has
dropped from 27.0 percent in 1990–92 to 19.8 percent in

Undernourishment around the world in 2015

2014–16, a 26.6 percent decrease in relative terms. Many
individual Caribbean countries, however, have achieved the
international targets or are at least close to reaching them.
Barbados, Cuba, the Dominican Republic and Saint Vincent
and the Grenadines have all attained the MDG 1c hunger
target. The latter three have also reached the more
demanding WFS goal. Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago are
also very close to reaching the MDG 1c target. The
explanation for the region as a whole lagging behind lies in
the severe and still largely unabated problems experienced by
Haiti – a country hit by recurrent natural disasters, still facing
slow growth in food availability vis-à-vis population growth
and burdened by an increasingly degraded resource base as
well as a fragile national economy.16

■■ Oceania
The developing countries of Oceania have experienced slow
progress towards improved food security. The overall PoU in the
region fell by less than 10 percent between 1990–92 and
2014–16. This corresponds to an increase in the number of
undernourished people of about 0.5 million, or 50 percent.
Being largely small island developing states characterized by
high dependency on food imports, food security in most

countries can be severely affected by external shocks, including
international price volatility, adverse weather events and sudden
changes in the availability of a few important staples, such as
rice. The Pacific Islands face multiple burdens of malnutrition;
while hunger has fallen slowly, overweight, obesity and, as a
consequence, non-communicable diseases, such as type 2
diabetes and coronary heart disease, are taking a growing toll
on the region’s health and economic status.
Several countries in the Oceania region covered by this
report have achieved the MDG 1c hunger target, including
Fiji, Kiribati, Samoa and the Solomon Islands, while Vanuatu
has not. Samoa has also reached the more ambitious WFS
goal. The situation in Vanuatu has deteriorated dramatically
since Cyclone Pam hit the islands in March 2015.17 Before
this catastrophic event, the country had been showing
consistent progress in reducing hunger. In the case of Papua
New Guinea, by far the most populous country in the region,
a detailed assessment has not been possible due to the lack
of reliable background data. Overall progress
notwithstanding, there is considerable uncertainty about the
situation in the country, where the information needed to
reliably estimate undernourishment is largely absent.
Anecdotal evidence indicates that the country’s food security
situation is far from resolved.

Key findings
• Based on the latest estimates, about 795 million
people remain undernourished globally, down
167 million over the last decade, and 216 million
lower than in 1990–92. This means that just over
one in every nine people in the world are
currently unable to consume enough food to
conduct an active and healthy life.
• About 780 million people, or the vast majority of
the hungry, live in the developing regions. In
these regions, the prevalence of
undernourishment has dropped by 44.4 percent
since 1990–92, and the overall share now stands
at 12.9 percent of the total population.
• The year 2015 marks the end of the monitoring
period for the World Food Summit (WFS) and
Millennium Development Goal (MDG) hunger
targets. The latest projections suggest that, as a
whole, the developing regions have almost
reached the MDG 1c hunger target. From a
statistical perspective, the target was missed by a
small margin, but from a development perspective,

the essence of the MDG 1c commitment has
been fulfilled, at least globally. The WFS target,
by contrast, has been missed by a large margin.
The estimated number of undernourished
people is some 285 million above the envisaged
target for 2015.
• Wide differences persist across regions. Some
have made rapid progress in reducing hunger:
Latin America as well as the Eastern and
South-Eastern regions of Asia have all
achieved both the MDG 1c hunger target and
the more ambitious WFS goal. The MDG 1c
target has been reached in the Caucasus and
Central Asia and in the Northern and Western
regions of Africa. Progress has also been
recorded in the Caribbean, Oceania, Southern
Asia, and Southern and Eastern Africa, but at
too slow a pace to reach the MDG 1c target.
Finally, Central Africa and Western Asia are
moving away from the hunger targets, with a
higher proportion of undernourished in the
population now than in 1990–92.

Undernourishment around the world in 2015

• A total of 72 developing countries of the 129
monitored have reached the MDG 1c hunger
target. Of these, 29 countries have also
achieved the more ambitious WFS goal.
Another 12 countries, among the 72 countries
considered to have achieved the MDG 1c target,
have maintained the prevalence of
undernourishment below, or very close to,
5 percent since 1990–92.
• Most countries that have achieved the
international hunger targets enjoyed stable
political conditions and economic growth,
accompanied by sound social protection policies
targeted towards vulnerable population groups.
In these countries, the commitment to fight food
insecurity proved successful in spite of the
difficulties posed by rapid population growth,
volatile commodity prices, high food and energy
prices, rising unemployment and the economic
recessions that occurred in the late 1990s and
again after 2008.

18

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2015

• In several countries that have failed to reach the
international hunger targets, natural and
human-induced disasters or political instability
have generated a status of protracted crisis,
which has prevented the protection of
vulnerable population groups and the
promotion of income opportunities for all.
In other countries, the benefits of economic
growth have failed to reach the poor
population, due to lack of effective social
protection and income redistribution policies.
In the short run, the only means to address food
insecurity is humanitarian intervention. In the
medium and the long term, hunger eradication
can only be pursued if all stakeholders
contribute to designing and enacting policies for
improving economic opportunities, the
protection of vulnerable groups and disaster
preparedness. Action undertaken at the global
and regional levels should take into account
country specificities and exposure to natural and
human-induced disasters, especially those of
small island developing states.

Inside the hunger target:
comparing trends in undernourishment
and underweight in children

P

rogress towards the MDG “hunger target”, or MDG
target 1c, which requires halving, between 1990 and
2015, the proportion of people who suffer from
hunger, is measured by two different indicators: the
prevalence of undernourishment (PoU), monitored by FAO,
and the prevalence of underweight children under five years
of age (CU5), monitored by the United Nations Children’s
Fund (UNICEF) and the World Health Organization (WHO).
The end of the MDG monitoring period offers a good
opportunity to look back at the evolution of these indicators
and to identify common trends, but also to understand the
reasons for possible deviations.
Common trends should be discernible as both indicators
were approved by the international community to measure
the hunger target. Deviations, however, could arise from
the different methods used to compile them18 and the
different dimensions of food insecurity that they are
expected to capture.
Understanding the different trends of the two indicators
across regions and over time is important, as it may offer

insights into the complexity of food security, and possibly
lead to more targeted policy interventions. Underweight
can be caused by a range of different factors – not only
calorie or protein deficiency, but also poor hygiene, disease
or limited access to clean water. All these factors impede
the body’s ability to absorb nutrients from food and
eventually result in manifestations of nutrient deficits such
as stunting, wasting or underweight. For this reason, the
two indicators do not always reflect the same underlying
problem. Where lack of sufficient food is the main cause of
underweight, the PoU and the CU5 should move
synchronously. Where poor food utilization prevails instead,
the two indicators are likely to diverge.
Considering the developing regions as a whole for the
entire MDG monitoring period, the two indicators show
consistent trends. From 1990 to 2013, the CU5 moved
from 27.4 percent to 16.6 percent, a 39.3 percent
reduction, while the PoU declined by 44.5 percent between
1990–92 and 2014–16 (Table 4, Figure 5, pp. 20–21).19 The
annual rate of decline is similar.

Regional patterns
The parallel progress of the two indicators for the developing
regions as a whole is not always evident when the analysis
focuses on individual regions. In some, the PoU and CU5
indicators show different rates of reduction (Table 4). Within
sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, the PoU and the CU5 only
move together for Eastern Africa, while they diverge over
time for almost all other subregions. By contrast, trends in
the subregions in Asia and in Latin America and the
Caribbean largely move in parallel. The rest of this section
will analyse these divergences and similarities in trends.

■■ Northern Africa
The region’s problems are well captured by MDG hunger
indicators. Both the PoU and CU5 show low absolute levels
of food insecurity, even more so than for other developing
regions. In particular, the CU5 declined rapidly over the
monitoring period, with a reduction from 9.5 to
4.8 percent. Food utilization conditions appear favourable
in the region, with more than 90 percent of the population
having access to clean water and improved sanitation

facilities in 2012. The PoU has remained below the
5 percent threshold since 1990–92 (Figure 6). Many
countries of the region have not only sufficient, but
excessive levels of calorie availability. Just as in Western
Africa, much of the problem lies in unbalanced diets with
too many calories from carbohydrates, which are mostly
derived from cereals and sugar. Food consumption
subsidies, which are granted in several Northern African
countries, have played a part in maintaining
undernourishment at low levels, while at the same time
favouring an excessive consumption of energy-intense
foods, potentially leading to increased risks of noncommunicable diseases and obesity.

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2015

■■ Sub-Saharan Africa
For the region as a whole, undernourishment and child
underweight were looming large at the beginning of the
1990s, with both indicators exceeding 25 percent. Since
then, the PoU and CU5 have decreased at a similarly slow
pace (Figure 7).
During the 1990s, per capita GDP decreased in a number
of sub-Saharan countries, and the region’s Human
Development Index was the lowest in the world.20 These
factors explain the slow decline in undernourishment, as
well as the sluggish investment in infrastructure and
health.21 On average, during the 1990s, only one in four

people had access to electricity, compared with a world
average of one in three. Likewise, there were only 0.15
physicians available for every thousand people, compared
with a world average of 1.3.
Over the 2000s, the food security situation in sub-Saharan
Africa gradually improved. Economic growth resumed in
several countries, resulting in a decline of the PoU, but major
challenges remained unaddressed, especially in terms of
addressing the region’s inadequate hygiene conditions and
quality of diets. This divergence appears particularly evident
for Western Africa. Here, the PoU has fallen by over
60 percent since 1990–92, owing to the progress of large
countries such as Ghana and Nigeria. These changes,
however, were largely brought about by the higher
availability of staple foods, which did not address the dietary
imbalances in the region. While the PoU for Western Africa
fell rapidly, the CU5 remained stubbornly high, at levels of
more than 20 percent.
Sub-Saharan Africa’s problems not only illustrate the
multifaceted nature of food security, but also suggest that
different dimensions require different approaches to
successfully improve food security. For instance, making even
more carbohydrates available is unlikely to further improve
overall food security. Rather, new measures should focus on
the ability of poor people to access balanced diets and on
overall living conditions, to prevent negative health
outcomes such as underweight, wasting and stunting in
children.

Inside the hunger target: comparing trends in undernourishment and underweight in children

■■ Caucasus and Central Asia
The region has had overall low rates and has made good
progress over time for both the PoU and CU5 indicators
(Figure 8). The economic and political transitions of the early
1990s and, later, the economic crisis of the early 2000s only
seem to have influenced the PoU, which exhibited marked
swings during these periods. The two indicators were again
moving in parallel by the early 2000s, with improvements in
living conditions. In recent years, the CU5 has maintained
levels below 5 percent in most countries, with the exception
of Tajikistan, where it remains at about 15 percent. Since the
early 1990s, only few countries have occasionally presented
CU5 values above 10 percent. At the same time, the transition
turmoil barely affected the region’s overall health and hygiene
conditions. The proportion of the population with access to
clean water and improved sanitation facilities has always been
higher than 85 percent and 90 percent, respectively,
throughout the monitoring period. These conditions, together
with the improvement in nutrition experienced during the past
decade, explain the steady downward trend in the CU5. It is
worth highlighting that the high poverty rates experienced by
most countries were limited to relatively short periods of time
and did not significantly worsen food utilization.

■■ Eastern Asia
Steady and rapid progress for both indicators is observed in
Eastern Asia. At the beginning of the monitoring period,
the PoU declined slightly faster than the CU5 (Figure 9).

■■ Southern Asia
Southern Asia is the region with the highest historical CU5
levels, but is also the region where rapid progress has been
made in reducing underweight among young children. The
prevalence of underweight children declined from
49.2 percent in 1990 to 30.0 percent in 2013, with a
39.0 percent reduction over the MDG monitoring period
(Table 4, p. 20). By contrast, the PoU in Southern Asia
made less progress overall, resulting in a convergence
between the two indicators over time (Figure 10).
There is growing evidence that helps explain the
relatively rapid decline of the CU5. Many countries in the
region have experienced robust economic growth over the
past 25 years, bringing down poverty rates. While the
steady decline in child underweight is consistent with the
decrease in poverty, undernourishment only went down
from 23.9 percent to 15.7 percent between 1990–92 and

The region’s average PoU saw some minor ups and downs
in the 1990s and the early 2000s, while the reduction in
undernourishment accelerated again after 2006.
The more consistent decline in the CU5 can be traced to
the steady improvement of hygiene conditions in several
countries. Access to safe water, for example, increased by
37 percent over the monitoring period, while access to
improved sanitation facilities has increased by 153 percent
since the early 1990s. These factors have had a strong
positive impact on food utilization, and support both the
low CU5 levels and its rapid improvement over time.

2014–16. This different pattern is largely due to India, the
country that more directly affects the regional picture as a
result of its large population. Explanations offered for the
inconsistency between food consumption and income
levels in India range from increasing inequalities, to poor
data, to the challenges of capturing the changing energy
requirements of the population.22 But the puzzle still seems
to be unresolved; and, as noted in the previous section,
calorie consumption is lower than what per capita incomes
and poverty rates would suggest.
The reasons for CU5 progress include enhanced access
to safe water and sanitation and, as a consequence, better
hygiene and health conditions. For instance, household
access to improved sanitation nearly doubled from
23 percent to 42 percent between 1990 and 2012. Over
the same period, access to safe water rose from 73 percent
to 91 percent. In addition, targeted nutrition programmes
in key countries in the region, aimed at young children,
pregnant women and women of reproductive age, likely
contributed to a rapidly declining CU5. Examples include,
among others, the Integrated Child Development Scheme,
implemented in India since 1975, and the Bangladesh
Integrated Nutrition Programme, funded by the World
Bank. Despite the rapid decrease in the CU5, the indicator
was still much higher compared with those of all other
Asian subregions. This suggests that much more progress
can be achieved in the future by combining policy
interventions that enhance both food availability and
utilization.

■■ South-Eastern Asia
South-Eastern Asia is among the regions that showed faster
progress across the first seven MDGs. This also holds for the
hunger target as measured by both the PoU and CU5.
Undernourishment and underweight in children were both
above 30 percent at the beginning of the monitoring period
(Figure 11), but the PoU declined more quickly throughout
the 2000s. This would be in line with the view that policy
interventions to improve hygiene conditions – for instance
water and sanitation infrastructure – typically require higher
investments compared with those aimed at enhancing food
availability. The CU5 has declined rapidly in the region, but is
still above 20 percent in more than one country. Rapid
progress has been made in improving hygiene conditions,
with 71 percent of the population having access to better
sanitation.23 In view of the good growth prospects in the
region, this also means that more progress will be possible,
provided that interventions improve the diets of poor
population groups and ensure wider access to clean water
and sanitation facilities.

■■ Western Asia
Western Asia shows a unique pattern of change. While the
PoU has increased since the early 1990s, reflecting political
instability in a number of countries, the CU5 has continued
to decline. Underweight in children is at a low level virtually
everywhere, while the sparse data available indicate high

proportions in Yemen – well beyond 20 percent – and to a
lower extent in other countries, such as Iraq and Syria,
where data for the 2000s point to shares not far from
10 percent. Hygiene conditions in the region are generally
good, with more than 90 percent of the population having
access to clean water sources, and 88 percent of the
population having access to improved sanitation facilities in
2012. The rise in the PoU, as shown in the previous section,
reflects political and social problems together with war and
civil strife in a limited number of countries in the region,
which generated large migrant and refugee populations
(Figure 12).

■■ Latin America and the Caribbean
In the region as a whole, the two hunger indicators have
converged over time, at a faster rate after the year 2000,
when progress in reducing the PoU accelerated. The PoU,
estimated at 14.7 percent in 1990–92, dropped to
5.5 percent by 2014–16, while the CU5 has decreased from
7.0 percent to 2.7 percent over the same period (Figure 13).
The CU5 is generally low, with few exceptions. Within the
region, Central America remains the most problematic area,
with almost no improvement recorded over the MDG
monitoring period. The PoU and the CU5 in Central America
were close to each other in the early 1990s (at about
11 percent of the population) and both indicators have seen
little progress since then. Shares higher than 10 percent have
been reported for Haiti in recent periods; in this country the

■■ Oceania
This region is characterized by high rates of underweight
among children. Without progress over 25 years, the CU5 is
now not far from levels prevalent in many parts of subSaharan Africa. Slow progress is also observed for the PoU
(Figure 14). The common trends for the two indicators
suggest related underlying drivers, especially low food
availability and dietary diversity. In many small island
developing states in the region, the variety of nutrients
available and acquired is somewhat limited.

indicator has decreased since the early 1990s, when it
exceeded 20 percent. Relatively high values have been
reported, in recent years, also for Guatemala, Honduras and
Guyana, although not exceeding 15 percent.
Progress for both indicators stems from economic growth
combined with a stronger commitment to social protection,
especially over the last decade. Many countries have made
hunger and malnutrition eradication a high political priority.
At the continental level, important commitments started in
2005 with the Hunger-Free Latin America and the Caribbean
Initiative, and eventually led, through various other
initiatives, to the Santiago Declaration of the Community of
Latin American and Caribbean States in January 2013.
Despite progress, major challenges remain. Many countries
are witnessing growing overweight and obesity rates and, as
a result, the increasing prevalence of non-communicable
diseases.

Slow progress in increasing access to safe drinking water
and improved sanitation facilities has also contributed to lack
of progress in reducing food insecurity. Only 55 percent of
households in the region have access to safe water, while
only 35 percent have access to improved sanitation facilities.
Several indicators for the underlying drivers even suggest
some deterioration of the situation. While access to safe
water has improved by just 12 percent since the early 1990s,
access to sanitation facilities has declined by about 1 percent
per year over the same period.
Moreover, the region suffers from a malnutrition problem
not well captured by the PoU and CU5, namely the growing
coexistence of undernutrition and overnutrition. One
contributing factor to overnutrition has been the
“westernization” of food consumption patterns, which is
associated with a rising prevalence of overweight and
obesity.

• For the world as a whole, the MDG 1 indicators
for prevalence of undernourishment and
underweight children under 5 years of age have
largely moved in parallel, providing a consistent
message regarding achievement of the hunger
target. At the regional level, however, noticeable
divergences have emerged and often persisted.
These differences can often be traced back to
different rates of progress in improving the
quality of diets and in improving hygiene
conditions and access to clean water. These
factors affect people’s ability to derive sound
nutrition from the food they consume.
• Underweight in children is expected to decline
less rapidly than undernourishment, given that
better hygiene conditions, access to clean water
and more varied diets usually require more
investment and more time to materialize than
enhanced availability of calories. This has been
the case in South-Eastern Asia, where
undernourishment has declined at a faster rate
than child underweight, especially throughout
the 2000s, indicating that there is still room for
improving dietary quality, particularly for poorer
population groups. A similar situation is found in
Northern Africa, where carbohydrate-rich diets
keeps undernourishment under control, but a
lack of dietary quality and diversity has pushed
child malnutrition to relatively high levels.
• Despite showing rapid reduction, Southern Asia
is the region with the highest historical
prevalence of underweight children among the
developing regions. Factors such as poor health
and inadequate hygiene conditions have held
back progress towards improving overall food
security. These factors may deserve more
attention in future efforts to improve food
security at the country level.
• In sub-Saharan Africa, there has been limited
progress in reducing both undernourishment and
child underweight. This suggests that all aspects
of food security need to be tackled – including
ensuring the availability of, and access to, more
and better quality food, enhanced hygiene
conditions and access to clean water – before
significant progress towards improved food
security can be made.

Food security and nutrition:
the drivers of change

I

n 2000, world leaders met and adopted the United Nations
Millennium Declaration. Later, eight Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs) were set out, including the first
one on halving hunger and extreme poverty rates, reflecting the
world’s commitment to improving the lives of billions of people.
Half a year remains before the end of 2015, the deadline
for achieving most of the MDG targets, including the hunger
target, MDG 1c, traditionally measured using the prevalence
of undernourishment (PoU) indicator. As this report shows,
since 1990–92, over 216 million people have been rescued
from a life of hunger – to date, 72 countries have already
reached the MDG 1c hunger target, with another nine just
short by a small margin. Of these, 12 developing countries
already had undernourishment rates below 5 percent in
1990–92. Meanwhile, twenty-nine countries have
accomplished the more ambitious 1996 World Food Summit
(WFS) goal of halving the number of chronically underfed
people (Tables 2 and 3, pp. 12–13).
Progress towards food security and nutrition targets requires
that food is available, accessible and of sufficient quantity and
quality to ensure good nutritional outcomes. Proper nutrition
contributes to human development; it helps people realize their
full potential and take advantage of opportunities offered by
the development process. As past editions of this report (2010,
2012 and 2014) have shown, good governance, political
stability and the rule of law, and the absence of conflict and
civil strife, weather-related shocks or excessive food price
volatility, are conducive to all dimensions of food security.
This section looks at a range of factors that enable
progress towards food security and nutrition goals. The list of
factors – economic growth, agricultural productivity growth,
markets (including international trade) and social protection –
is by no means exhaustive. The section also shows how being
in a protracted crisis has deleterious effects on progress in
hunger reduction. Preliminary quantitative analysis, using data
from the period 1992–2013, has helped identify these drivers
of change and their relative importance in shaping progress
against hunger.24
Economic growth is central to the fight against hunger –
countries that become richer are less susceptible to food
insecurity. Policy-makers in rapidly growing economies have

26

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2015

increased capacity and resources to dedicate to improving food
security and nutrition. But this is not always the case. Economic
growth, while a necessary condition for progress in poverty
and hunger reduction, especially in the face of an expanding
population, is not sufficient. It is inclusive growth that matters
– growth that promotes equitable access to food, assets and
resources, particularly for poor people and women, so that
individuals can develop their potential.25
Across the developing world, the majority of the poor and
most of the hungry live in rural areas, where family farming
and smallholder agriculture is a prevailing – albeit not universal
– mode of farm organization. Although the ability of family
farming and smallholder agriculture to spur growth through
productivity increases varies considerably, its role in reducing
poverty and hunger is key. Growth in family farming and
smallholder agriculture, through labour and land productivity
increases, has significant positive effects on the livelihoods of
the poor through increases in food availability and incomes.
The linkages between food security and international trade
are complex and context-specific. Policies that affect exports
and imports of food contribute to determining relative prices,
wages and incomes in the domestic market, and hence shape
the ability of poor people to access food. Trade, in itself, is
neither a threat nor a panacea when it comes to food security.
The opportunities and risks to food security associated with
trade openness should be carefully assessed and addressed
through an expanded set of policy instruments.
Social protection systems have become an important tool
in the fight against hunger. More than one hundred countries
implement conditional or unconditional cash transfer
programmes that focus on promoting food security and
nutrition, health and education, particularly for children. Food
distribution schemes and employment guarantee programmes
are also important. The expansion of social protection across
the developing world has been critical for progress towards
the MDG 1c hunger target. Providing regular and predictable
cash transfers to poor households often plays a critical role in
terms of filling immediate food gaps, but can also help
improve the lives and livelihoods of the poor by alleviating
constraints to their productive capacity. Combining social
protection with complementary agricultural development

Food security and nutrition: the drivers of change

measures, such as the Purchase from Africans for Africa
programme, which links family farmers and smallholders to
school-feeding programmes, can maximize the povertyreducing impact of these programmes.
In 1990, only 12 countries in Africa were facing food
crises, of which only four were in protracted crises.26 Just
20 years later, a total of 24 countries were experiencing food
crises, with 19 in crisis for eight or more of the previous ten

years. Food insecurity can be both a cause and effect of
protracted crises and can be instrumental in triggering or
deepening conflict and civil strife – it increasingly lies at the
root of protracted crisis situations. The impact of conflict on
food security can be more dramatic than the direct impact of
war, and mortality caused by conflict through food insecurity,
and famine can far exceed deaths directly caused by
violence.27

Economic growth and progress towards food
security and nutrition targets
Economic growth is necessary for alleviating poverty and
reducing hunger and malnutrition; it is critical for sustainably
increasing employment and incomes, especially in low-income
countries. Since the beginning of the 1990s and up to 2013
(most of the MDG monitoring period) global output per capita
has increased by 1.3 percent per year, on average. The
economies of low- and middle-income countries – including all
developing countries – grew more rapidly, by 3.4 percent per
year. Nevertheless, these numbers mask considerable variation
in economic growth performance across regions and countries.
The relationship between economic growth and hunger is
complex. Economic growth increases household incomes,
through higher wages, increased employment opportunities, or
both, due to stronger demand for labour. In a growing
economy, more household members are able to find work and
earn incomes. This is essential for improving food security and
nutrition and contributes to a virtuous circle as better nutrition
strengthens human capacities and productivity, thus leading to
better economic performance. However, the question here is
whether or not those people who are living in extreme poverty
and are most affected by hunger will be given the opportunity
to participate in the benefits of growth and, if they are,
whether they will be able to take advantage of it.
On average, and across the developing world since 1990–92,
economic growth has brought strong and persistent hunger
reduction. This is evident when GDP growth per capita is
plotted against the PoU (Figure 15, p. 28). Increases in the
incomes of the poor are associated with higher intake of
dietary energy and other nutrients. But in the longer term, as
economies grow and countries become richer, this relationship
weakens – increases in GDP growth may bring relatively fewer
people out of hunger (in Figure 15, the line reflecting the
relationship between economic growth and the PoU was
steeper in 1992 than in 2010). Among the early success stories
is Ghana, which has experienced average annual growth rates
of over 3 percent, and has witnessed impressive hunger

reduction rates – the PoU in the country fell from 47 percent in
1990–92 to below 5 percent in 2012–14 (Box 1, p. 29).
In several cases, the positive effects of economic growth on
food security and nutrition are related to greater participation
of women in the labour force. In Brazil, for example, labour
force participation of women rose from 45 percent in 1990–94
to 60 percent in 2013. In Costa Rica, the proportion of women
workers increased by 23 percent between 2000 and 2008.
Spending by women typically involves more household
investments in food and nutrition, but also in health, sanitation
and education, compared with the case when resources are
controlled by men.28
But not all countries that experienced strong economic
growth performed well in terms of hunger reduction. Some
countries progressed well towards the international hunger
targets, while others experienced setbacks. In general, there
has been uneven progress in translating economic growth into
improvements in food security.

■■ Inclusive economic growth and poverty
reduction
On the whole, progress in alleviating poverty has been faster
than in fighting hunger. This is because the hungry are the
poorest of the poor; they have limited or no access to physical
and financial assets, little or no education, and often suffer
from ill health. Poor agricultural households lack access to
sufficient, high-quality land and other natural resources or to
remunerative sources of income (self-employment, wage
labour). At the same time, hunger creates a trap from which
people cannot easily escape. Hunger and undernutrition mean
less-productive individuals, who are more prone to disease and
thus often unable to earn more and improve their livelihoods.
This, in turn, hinders progress in alleviating extreme poverty
and fighting hunger – particularly as labour is the principal
asset held by the poor.

Not all types of growth are effective in reducing hunger and
malnutrition. Very poor people cannot participate in growth
processes that require capital or generate employment for the
educated and skilled. For example, economic growth generated
by capital-intensive exploitation of resources, such as minerals
and oil, is likely to have very few or weak direct linkages to the
poor. The greater the inequality in the distribution of assets,
such as land, water, capital, education and health, the more
difficult it is for the poor to improve their situation and the
slower the progress in reducing undernourishment.29
Inclusive economic growth improves the incomes of the
poor. If these incomes grow more rapidly than the growth rate
of the economy, income distribution also improves. What
matters for effectively improving food security is for economic
growth to reach those in extreme poverty – the bottom quintile
of the income distribution. Approximately three-quarters of the
world’s poor live in rural areas, with the share even higher in
low-income countries.30 In most developing regions, the risk of
working poverty (workers who live on less than US$1.25 a day)

28

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2015

is highest for employment in agriculture – about eight out of
ten working poor are engaged in vulnerable employment in
the informal economy, particularly in agriculture.31
Agriculture on its own can trigger growth in countries with a
high share of agriculture in GDP. But even if other sectors of the
economy, such as mining or services, were to grow, agriculture,
through targeted investments, can become an avenue through
which the poor participate in the growth process. Empirical
evidence suggests that agricultural growth in low-income
countries is three times more effective in reducing extreme
poverty compared with growth in other sectors. In sub-Saharan
Africa, agricultural growth can be 11 times more effective in
reducing poverty than growth in non-agricultural sectors.32
Investments and policies that promote increased agricultural
labour productivity lead to increases in rural income. Countries
that have invested in their agriculture sectors – and especially in
improving productivity of smallholders and family farming –
have made significant progress towards the MDG 1c hunger
target (Boxes 1 and 2).

Food security and nutrition: the drivers of change

BOX 1

Ghana: economic growth with improved food security and nutrition

Since 1990–92, Ghana has experienced high per capita
economic growth rates averaging 3.3 percent per year.
At the same time, the proportion of the population in
extreme poverty declined from 51 percent in 1991 to
29 percent in 2005 and valid assessments suggest that
the declining trend has continued. The prevalence of
undernourishment – the proportion of the population
experiencing chronic hunger – declined from 47.3 percent
in 1990–92 to below 5 percent in 2012–14.
Agriculture has played a significant part in Ghana’s
growth. Together with increases in the production of
cocoa, domestic food production increased significantly,
promoted by policies, institutional reforms and
investments under the 1991–2000 Medium-Term
Agricultural Development Programme.1
But trade liberalization also led to substitution of local
production of some staples as well as of manufacturing
with imported goods, creating challenges for
employment. In addition, uneven development across
different population groups and regions, such as in the
north of the country, led to increasing income inequality,
with the Gini coefficient increasing from 38 to nearly 43
in 2005. This challenge was counterbalanced, to a
significant degree, by the establishment of effective safety
nets and social protection mechanisms under the
country’s Poverty Reduction Strategies and the National

Social Protection Strategy (NSPS). The development of
such social protection mechanisms was underpinned by
the expansion of the tax base, brought about by rapid
economic growth, from 12 to 24 percent in only 15 years,
between 1990 and 2004, which doubled government
revenues.
The NSPS gives priority to vulnerable women in
agriculture with low education and poor credit access,
while making efforts to empower other disadvantaged
groups. Other programmes, such as Livelihood
Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP), which provides
cash transfers to poor people with disabilities, also
contributed to poverty reduction. The government,
supported by the international development community,
is undertaking efforts to strengthen human resources by
increasing spending in education, as well as by developing
the infrastructure needed to further promote growth.2

United Republic of Tanzania: economic and agricultural growth without improved food
security and nutrition
Since the beginning of the 1990s, the United Republic of
Tanzania’s average annual GDP growth of 2.3 percent has
been mainly driven by the expansion of industry and
services. Agriculture has also been expanding, but at a
relatively slower pace. Between 1992 and 2013, mean
annual growth in agricultural labour productivity –
measured by value added per capita – averaged
1.6 percent, while the share of agriculture in GDP
declined from nearly 50 percent to 26 percent.
During the same period, the country’s prevalence of
undernourishment increased from 24.2 percent in 1990–
92 to 34.6 percent in 2012–14, and the number of
undernourished from 6.4 to 17.0 million people. Only
from around 2004, did the prevalence of
undernourishment begin to show encouraging signs of
reversing its past upward trend. Poverty remains high,
although the proportion of the population living in
extreme poverty declined from 72 percent to 44 percent
between 1992 and 2012.
The disconnected paths between growth on the one
hand, and poverty and food insecurity on the other, can
be largely attributed to trade liberalization policies and
privatization efforts, which were not accompanied by
effective policies to modernize agriculture and include the

poor and food-insecure in the distribution of earnings
from growth during the 1990s. Low investment in
agriculture, which is dominated by small family farmers
producing for subsistence and having poor access to local
and international markets, appears to explain, at least
partly, the divergence. In addition, hunger and poor
nutrition constrained the productive capacity of the
labour force.1
Even though market reforms have enhanced the role of
the private sector in promoting further investments,
changes in governance are still needed. The Tanzania
Investment Centre, established in 2000, contributed to
growth, but needs to be supported by an improved
regulatory framework that can provide effective incentives
for investments. In addition, the country is still missing the
infrastructure needed for broad-based economic
development. Secure access to land remains a key
constraint, not only for agriculture, but also for domestic
and foreign investors.2
Social protection policies have a long history in the
United Republic of Tanzania and have been successful in
providing income support to multiple or specific groups,
and in shielding the poor and vulnerable from the
impacts of shocks.3 Nevertheless, the effectiveness of
such programmes in contributing towards poverty and
hunger reduction is constrained by their limited coverage
and targeting exclusion errors. There will be a need to
continue to expand social protection mechanisms to
help reduce poverty and improve food security and
nutrition.

Food security and nutrition: the drivers of change

The accommodation of gender considerations is crucial for
economic growth in countries with agriculture-dependent
economies. Women play important roles as producers,
managers of productive resources and income earners, and
they are key providers of unpaid care work in rural households
and communities. However, despite decades of efforts to
address gender inequalities, many rural women continue to
face gender-based constraints that limit their capacity to
contribute to growth and take advantage of new opportunities
arising from the changes shaping national economies. This has
serious consequences for well-being – not only for women
themselves, but also for their families and societies at large –
and it represents one of the main reasons for the economic
underperformance of agriculture in poorer countries.33 While it
is sometimes argued that economic growth inevitably leads to
gender equality, the empirical evidence is weak and
inconsistent. Much seems to depend on policies and strategies
aimed at shaping inclusive markets and reducing poverty.34
Agriculture-based solutions need to be complemented by
interventions that promote the productive potential of the

rural space. In addition, direct support to rural livelihoods
through social protection programmes provides immediate
relief to the most vulnerable. Such programmes also have
long-term benefits – they enable broad participation of the
poor in the growth process through better access to
education, health and proper nutrition, all of which expand
and strengthen human potential.
Social protection can establish a virtuous circle of progress
involving the poor with increased incomes, employment and
wages. For example, the Zero Hunger Programme and the
Bolsa Família in Brazil were crucial for achieving inclusive
growth in the country. Bolsa Família reached almost a quarter
of the population, mainly women, transferring above US$100
every month to each family, as long as they sent their children
to school.35 With the Brazilian economy growing at 3 percent
per year since 2000, thus providing the necessary public
revenues, these programmes have significantly reduced
income inequality – between 2000 and 2012, the average
incomes of the poorest quintile of the population grew three
times as fast as those of the wealthiest 20 percent.36

The contribution of family farming and smallholder
agriculture to food security and nutrition
More than 90 percent of the 570 million farms worldwide are
managed by an individual or a family, relying predominately
on family labour. These farms produce more than 80 percent
of the world’s food, in terms of value. Globally, 84 percent of
family farms are smaller than 2 hectares and manage only
12 percent of all agricultural land. While small farms tend to
have higher yields than larger farms, labour productivity is less
and most small family farmers are poor and food-insecure.37
The sustainability and future food security of these farms may
be threatened by intensive resource use. Public policies that
recognize the diversity and complexity of the challenges faced
by family farms throughout the value chain are necessary for
ensuring food security.
Improved productivity of agricultural resources through
sustainable intensification plays a key role in increasing food
availability and improving food security and nutrition. At the
global level, productivity and food availability have been
increasing, contributing significantly to reductions in
undernourishment worldwide. Higher agricultural labour
productivity is generally associated with lower levels of
undernourishment (Figure 16).
Public policies should provide incentives for the adoption of
sustainable agricultural intensification practices and techniques
– sustainable land management, soil conservation, improved

water management, diversified agricultural systems and
agroforestry – in order to produce more outputs from the
same area of land while reducing negative environmental
impacts. More conventional yield-enhancing technologies,
such as improved seed varieties and mineral fertilizers, are also
valuable options, especially when combined with greater
attention to using these inputs efficiently.
With increased productivity, farmers grow more food,
become more competitive and receive higher incomes.
Productivity growth in small family farms contributes to more
inclusive growth, not only by reducing the prices of staple foods
but also by improving access to food. With well-functioning
rural labour markets, such productivity growth increases the
demand for labour in rural areas, generating jobs for the poor
and raising the unskilled labour wage rate. Rural household
members diversify their income sources by obtaining better-paid
off-farm work, which helps poverty and hunger to decline.
In spite of overall progress, marked regional differences
persist. In the early 1990s, average value added per worker in
agriculture was lowest in sub-Saharan Africa, approximately
US$700 in 2005 prices, compared with other regions, such as
Eastern Asia and Latin America, where it amounted to
US$4 600 and US$4 400, respectively. By 2010–13, average value
added per worker in agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa

amounted to US$1 199, whereas in Eastern Asia and Latin
America, it had risen to US$15 300 and US$6 000, respectively.
Gains in labour productivity have also been slower in subSaharan Africa, and so have been the reductions in the PoU,
with current levels systematically higher than in other regions.
The evidence suggests that agricultural productivity gains
have helped countries reduce undernourishment. For
example, over the period 1990–92 to 2012–14 in subSaharan Africa, where agriculture is dominated by small
family farms, countries that made little progress towards
achieving the MDG 1c hunger target, such as Botswana,
Côte d’Ivoire, Liberia, Namibia, Swaziland, Uganda, the
United Republic of Tanzania and Zambia, experienced
average gains in agricultural value added per worker of only
25 percent. These gains were significantly lower than those
experienced in Angola, Benin, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, and
Mali, countries that have met the MDG 1c hunger target. On
average, labour productivity in agriculture in these countries
increased by 69 percent between 1990–92 and 2012–14.
Over the same period, in sub-Saharan African countries that
have made progress towards the target but not yet achieved
it, average agricultural value added per worker increased by
42 percent.

Similar patterns are observed when looking at a more
traditional measure of agricultural productivity – output per
hectare. Significant yield gaps – the difference between farmers’
yields and technical potential yields achieved using the latest
varieties and under the best of conditions – still persist,
particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Such yield gaps reflect a
largely suboptimal use of inputs and insufficient adoption of the
most productive technologies. In Mali (an MDG 1c achiever), for
example, the yield gap for rainfed maize – in 2008–10 – was
75 percent, a significantly high value but lower than those
observed in Uganda (83 percent) and the United Republic of
Tanzania (88 percent), suggesting a linkage between agricultural
productivity and progress towards food security.38
In the recent past, in many sub-Saharan African countries,
agricultural growth has been mostly driven by more extensive
use of land and reallocation of productive factors – not
necessarily oriented to supplying local markets and reducing
food insecurity – rather than the support of public policies to
expand access to agricultural credit and insurance, advisory
services and sustainable technologies.
Other constraining factors that compromise agricultural
productivity gains and the generation of stable incomes for
family farmers include weather-related shocks; poor

Food security and nutrition: the drivers of change

transport, storage and communications infrastructure; and
missing or inefficient markets. Weak institutions and
inadequate public agricultural and rural development policies
are major causes of such failures.
Inclusive markets for smallholders and family farmers are an
important ingredient in promoting food security and nutrition.
Markets not only facilitate the flow of food from surplus to
deficit areas, ensuring food availability; they also transmit price
signals to farmers to adjust their production and input use.39
Well-functioning markets that foster price stability and
predictability are crucial – on the one hand, a significant share
of farmers rely on markets for generating part of their cash
income, while, on the other hand, many family farmers are
net-food buyers relying on markets to purchase part of their
food needs. Smallholder and family farming productivity and
access to markets are interlinked and contribute to both food
availability and access to food. Improving access to marketing
opportunities can also help boost productivity.

One relevant approach to increasing family farmers’ access
to markets is local food procurement by different levels of
government (local, regional and national). Not only can public
purchase schemes guarantee food security for vulnerable
populations and income for smallholders and family farmers,
but they may also enhance collective action to strengthen
their marketing capacities and ensure greater effectiveness.
To accelerate progress in improving access to food by the
poor, lagging regions, particularly sub-Saharan Africa, will
increasingly have to transform their agricultural policies to
significantly improve agricultural productivity and increase the
quantity of food supplied by family farmers. The importance
of family farming and smallholder agriculture is best reflected
by the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development
Programme (CAADP), which has established a goal of
6 percent annual agricultural growth. The expected impacts
are primarily to improve food security and nutrition, reduce
poverty and increase employment.

International trade and food security linkages
International trade and trade policies affect the domestic
availability and prices of goods and those of the factors of
production such as labour, with implications for food access.
International trade can also affect market structure,
productivity, sustainability of resource use, nutrition and
various population groups in different ways. Assessing its
impact on food security is thus highly complex. For example,
banning grain exports can boost domestic supplies and reduce
prices in the short run. This benefits consumers, but has
negative implications for farmers producing for export. Import
or export restrictions by major players affect global supplies
and exacerbate price volatility at the global level. Lowering
import duties reduces food prices paid by consumers, but can
put pressure on the incomes of import-competing farmers,
whose own food security may be negatively affected. Table 5
(p. 34) illustrates the complexity of the relationship between
trade and food security by listing the possible effects of trade,
both positive and negative, on different dimensions of food
security. In practice, the picture is further complicated by
market imperfections in national local markets, which prevent
the transmission of global price changes to those markets.

■■ Lessons from trade policy reforms
Policies to increase openness to international trade have
generally taken place in the context of wider economic
reforms, and it is therefore difficult to disentangle their effects.
A number of case studies have attempted to analyse the

impact of trade on food security, and, not surprisingly, the
results have been mixed.40 In China, economic reforms have
generated positive results for growth, poverty reduction and
food security. Trade, which has continued to grow rapidly, has
played a part, although domestic reforms appear to have been
more important in stimulating growth. Also in Nigeria,
domestic reforms improved incentives for agricultural
commodity producers, and per capita calorie intake increased
substantially after the implementation of trade reforms,
pointing to a possible positive impact on food security.
Similarly, in Chile, trade openness and the elimination of
policy distortions stimulated both agricultural and overall
economic growth and the transition from traditional crops to
more profitable products for export. Research has shown that
the reforms have contributed substantially to poverty reduction
and food security. Peru is another example of the positive food
security outcomes of institutional and economic transformations
aimed at strengthening private-sector initiatives, including trade
openness. However, the country implemented social protection
policies and programmes, to address uneven growth across
sectors and income inequality and mitigate the negative effects
of the reforms on vulnerable parts of the population.
Conversely, in Guatemala, Kenya, Senegal and the United
Republic of Tanzania, the food security outcomes of
economic and trade reforms appear to have been
disappointing. In Guatemala, while the reforms resulted in
diversified production of more profitable crops, external
factors (such as lower coffee prices) have undermined the

Food security and nutrition: the drivers of change

TABLE 5

The possible effects of trade liberalization on dimensions of food security

For net food-exporting countries, higher prices in international
markets can divert part of production previously available for domestic
consumption to exports, potentially reducing domestic availability of
staple foods.
For net food-importing countries, domestic producers unable to
compete with imports are likely to curtail production, reducing
domestic supplies and foregoing important multiplier effects of
agricultural activities in rural economies.

ACCESS

For net food-importing countries, food prices typically decrease when
border protection is reduced.
In the competitive sectors, incomes are likely to increase as the result
of greater market access for exports.
Input prices are likely to decrease.
The macroeconomic benefits of trade openness, such as export
growth and the inflow of foreign direct investment, support growth
and employment, which in turn boosts incomes.

For net food-exporting countries, the domestic prices of exportable
products may increase.
Employment and incomes in sensitive, import-competing sectors may
decline.

A greater variety of available foods may promote more balanced diets
and accommodate different preferences and tastes.
Food safety and quality may improve if exporters have more advanced
national control systems in place or if international standards are
applied more rigorously.

Greater reliance on imported foods has been associated with
increased consumption of cheaper and more readily available highcalorie/low-nutritional-value foods.
Prioritization of commodity exports can divert land and resources from
traditional indigenous foods that are often superior from a nutrition
point of view.

Imports reduce the seasonal effect on food availability and consumer
prices.
Imports mitigate local production risks.
Global markets are less prone to policy- or weather-related shocks.

For net food-importing countries, relying primarily on global markets
for food supplies and open trade policies reduces the policy space to
deal with shocks.
Net food-importing countries may be vulnerable to changes in trade
policy by exporters, such as export bans.
Sectors at earlier stages of development may become more
susceptible to price shocks and/or import surges.

potential to improve food security. In Kenya, limited
coordination in policy sequencing seems to have slowed
progress against hunger. The reforms in Senegal have shown
mixed results; although the PoU declined on aggregate,
female-headed households became less food-secure.
Indeed, the constraints faced by rural women, in terms of
lack of access to productive factors, such as land, credit,
inputs, storage and technology, may undermine their
capacity to adopt new technologies and/or take advantage
of economies of scale to improve their competitiveness. In
several developing countries, female small farmers who are
unable to compete with cheaper agricultural imports have
been forced to abandon or sell their farms, which in turn can
contribute to their food insecurity.41
While trade in itself is not intrinsically detrimental to food
security, for many countries, particularly those at earlier levels
of development, trade reforms can have negative effects on
food security in the short-to-medium term. Recent research
shows that countries supporting the primary sector tend to be
better off on most dimensions of food security (food
availability, access, and utilization), while taxation of this sector
is detrimental to food security.42 However, the evidence also
shows that excessive support can also lead to poor
performances on all dimensions of food security.

Possible negative effects

UTILIZATION

Possible positive effects

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2015

As countries become more open to international trade in
agricultural products, they become more exposed and potentially
more vulnerable to sudden changes in global agricultural
markets. For example, import surges – sudden increases in the
volume of imports from one year to the next – can hinder the
development of agriculture in developing countries.
Food sectors in developing countries that are characterized
by low productivity and lack of competitiveness are especially
vulnerable to import surges. A sudden disruption of domestic
production can have disastrous impacts on domestic farmers
and workers – loss of jobs and reduced incomes, with
potentially negative consequences for food security. During
the period 1984–2013, China, Ecuador, India, Kenya, Nigeria,
Pakistan, Uganda, the United Republic of Tanzania and
Zimbabwe were prone to sudden increases in imports
(defined as imports exceeding the average of the previous
three years by more than 30 percent), registering more than a
hundred surges.43
The factors that lead to an import surge may originate in
the importing country itself as a result of domestic supply
shortfalls or rapid increases in demand. Other factors are
exogenous, for example when countries providing significant
support to the production and/or export of food products
channel production surpluses to the international markets.

Food security and nutrition: the drivers of change

Surges resulting from external factors can be difficult for the
affected countries to manage.
Serious disruptions in domestic markets and negative
food security outcomes have been used to support
arguments for a more cautious approach to greater
openness to agricultural trade and for the establishment of
effective safeguards in new trade agreements. In
circumstances where the agriculture sector has yet to play
out its potential growth-enhancing role, trade policy,
including trade remedies, and incentives to boost domestic
production can have potentially important roles to play. At
the same time, complementary policies (as in the case of
Peru) can protect the most vulnerable groups from the
possible negative effects of openness to trade.

■■ Trade in the new agricultural markets context
The international agricultural market context has changed
from one characterized by depressed and stable prices to one
where market reactions to climatic and economic shocks can
give rise to sudden price increases or falls. Such changes have

prompted reassessment of the role of trade and trade policies
in promoting food security.
As food import bills have risen significantly following
increases in food prices in 2008, confidence in global markets
as reliable sources of affordable food has waned, and
attention has turned to support for domestic food production.
As a result, some developing countries have adopted policies
designed to influence domestic prices directly through border
measures and price controls, or to create incentives for
increasing domestic supply. Among the available trade policy
instruments, export restrictions and the elimination of import
tariffs have been the preferred policies to address food security
concerns during periods of high and volatile prices.
Trade, in itself, is neither a threat nor a panacea when it
comes to food security, but it can pose challenges and even
risks that need to be considered in policy decision-making. To
ensure that countries’ food security and development needs
are addressed in a consistent and systematic manner, they
need to have a better overview of all the policy instruments
available to them and the flexibility to apply the most effective
policy mix for achieving their goals.

The relevance of social protection
for hunger trends between 1990 and 2015
Social protection has directly contributed to hunger reduction
over the MDG monitoring period. Since the late 1990s, there
has been a global trend towards the extension of cash
transfers and other social assistance programmes, triggered in
part by the financial crises in emerging market economies
during that time.44 Social protection has since been
progressively anchored in national legislation, increasing its
coverage to support vulnerable groups.
Coverage has increased for many reasons, including the
recognition that social protection can be instrumental in
promoting sustainable and inclusive growth. Social protection
is a crucial part of the policy spectrum that addresses high and
persistent levels of poverty and economic insecurity, high and
growing levels of inequality, insufficient investments in human
resources and capabilities, and weak automatic stabilizers of
aggregate demand in the face of economic shocks.
With sufficient coverage and proper implementation, social
protection policies can promote both economic and social
development in the short and longer term, by ensuring that
people enjoy income security, have effective access to health
care and other social services, are able to manage risk and are
empowered to take advantage of economic opportunities.
Such policies play a crucial role in fostering inclusive and

sustainable growth, strengthening domestic demand,
facilitating the structural transformation of national
economies, and promoting decent work.45
Between 1990 and 2015, social protection programmes
have grown exponentially. Although much of this increase
occurred in high- and middle-income countries, significant
progress in social protection coverage has also been made in
the developing regions, as for example in Africa, through
innovative cash transfer and health-care programmes.46 Today,
every country in the world has at least one social assistance
programme in place. School-feeding programmes – the most
widespread type of social protection programme – are
implemented in 130 countries. Unconditional cash transfers
are also common, and are now implemented in 118 countries
globally. Likewise, conditional cash transfer and public works/
community asset programmes continue to expand rapidly.47
Global and regional efforts have also been instrumental,
including the push for national social protection floors
endorsed by International Labour Organization (ILO)
Recommendation 202.48 Yet, despite the proliferation of
programmes around the world, the ILO estimates that
70 percent of the world’s poor still do not have access to
adequate social protection. 49

Food security and nutrition: the drivers of change

International organizations, such as FAO and WFP, play
important roles in designing and implementing efficient and
effective safety net programmes and social protection systems
in the countries with a focus on food security and nutrition.
Social protection systems often meet immediate food gap
needs and, if designed accordingly, they can help improve lives
and livelihoods – a key factor for reducing the number of
hungry people in the world.
Recent research concludes that approximately 150 million
people worldwide are prevented from falling into extreme
poverty thanks to social protection.50 However, the impact of
social assistance programmes such as cash transfers on wellbeing extends beyond the direct effects of transfers. Transfers
can help households manage risk and mitigate the impact of
shocks that keep households mired in poverty.

Social assistance programmes such as cash transfer
programmes can influence the productive capacity of
beneficiaries, in particular those with limited access to
financial services for investment and risk mitigation. The
provision of regular and predictable cash transfers brings
significant benefits when markets are missing or do not
function well. When transfers are of sufficient size and
combined with additional support to beneficiaries, they can
often be saved and/or invested in productive assets and can
improve social inclusion for even greater returns over the
participants’ lifetimes.51 In combination with savings and
credit, environmental rehabilitation and agricultural
insurance, transfers can encourage prudent risk-taking and
increase productive outcomes – even for the poorest
households.52

The Productive Safety Net Programme in Ethiopia

Established in 2005, the Productive Safety Net Programme
(PSNP) is designed to enable the rural poor facing chronic
food insecurity to resist shocks, create assets and become
food self-sufficient. The programme provides predictable
multi-annual transfers, as food, cash or a combination of
both, to help chronically food-insecure people survive fooddeficit periods and avoid depleting their productive assets
while attempting to meet their basic food requirements.
The combination of cash and food transfers is based on
season and need, with food given primarily during the lean
season between June and August. Vulnerable households

receive six months of assistance each year to protect them
from acute food insecurity. Able-bodied members of
households participating in the programme are required to
contribute to productive activities that will build more resilient
livelihoods, such as rehabilitating land and water resources
and developing community infrastructure, including
rehabilitating rural roads and building schools and clinics.
Studies have shown that PSNP has had a positive impact on
the livelihoods of participating households. On average, across
the regions in which the programme operates (Afar, Amhara,
Dire Dawa, Harare, Oromiya, SNNP, Somali and Tigray), its
predictable transfers have shortened the lean season, during
which the rural poor are most food-insecure, by over one
month – the most significant improvement took place in
Amhara, where the lean season was shortened by nearly two
months. The programme also contributed towards increasing
children’s access to food. During the lean seasons between
2006 and 2010, the average number of meals consumed by
children in targeted households rose by 15 percent.
In some cases, the longer a household participates in the
programme, the shorter the lean period can become. This is
because regular and predictable cash transfers lead to
increased on-farm investments and improve the productive
capacity of beneficiary households. On average, five years of
participation raises livestock holdings each year by 0.38 tropical
livestock units, a weighted aggregation of different kinds of
livestock. In Oromiya, beneficiary households experienced an
increase in the value of productive assets of 112 birr.

Food security and nutrition: the drivers of change

Social assistance programmes, particularly when
combined with additional interventions in the areas of
drinking water supply, health and/or education, have been
shown to enhance nutritional outcomes and promote human
capital. The integration of nutrition objectives into social
assistance programmes also has the potential to significantly
accelerate progress in reducing undernutrition and raising
economic productivity.53 Furthermore, women are direct
beneficiaries of many social assistance programmes, such as
cash transfers. With more control of resources, this has
empowered them with positive impacts on food security and
nutritional status, especially of children.54 However, such
positive outcomes depend on other contextual factors and
require complementary interventions.
Over the past twenty five years, evidence has emerged
that social protection programmes can play a significant role
in achieving food security and nutrition targets. The evidence

suggests that increasing spending for strengthened social
protection programmes can be a highly cost-effective way to
promote rural poverty reduction and improved food security
and nutrition, and, hence, to achieve development goals.55
The fact that, despite the rapid growth of social protection
programmes in recent decades, about 70 percent of the
world population still lacks access to more adequate, formal
forms of social security, indicates there is still considerable
need for expanded coverage and, hence, scope for
accelerating the eradication of hunger. However, just
expanding social protection programmes will not suffice. The
most effective social protection policies for improved food
security and rural poverty reduction have been those that are
well integrated with agriculture sector policies and fully
aligned with the priorities and vision set out in broader
strategies aimed at creating viable and sustainable livelihoods
for the poor.

Protracted crises and hunger
Countries and areas in protracted crisis are “environments
in which a significant proportion of the population is
acutely vulnerable to death, disease and disruption of
livelihoods over a prolonged period of time. Governance in
these environments is usually very weak, with the state
having limited capacity to respond to, and mitigate, threats
to the population, or to provide adequate levels of
protection.”56 Based on the criteria set out in The State of
Food Insecurity in the World 2010,57 the list of countries
considered to be in protracted crisis situations was updated
in 2012 to encompass 20 countries58. However, it should be
noted that some protracted crisis situations are limited to
specific geographic areas, and may not affect the entire
country, let alone the entire population..
Although protracted crises are diverse in both their
causes and effects, food insecurity and malnutrition are
common prevalent features.59 Food insecurity and
malnutrition are particularly severe, persistent and
widespread in protracted crisis contexts. The approximate
combined population in protracted crisis situations in
2012 was 366 million people, of whom approximately
129 million were undernourished between 2010 and
2012 (including conservative estimates for countries
lacking data). This accounted for approximately
19 percent of the global total of food-insecure people.
In 2012, the mean prevalence of undernourishment in
protracted crisis situations was 39 percent, compared with
15 percent, on average, in the rest of the developing
world (see Figure 17).

Achieving the MDG 1c target of halving the proportion of
undernourished population in these countries poses an
enormous challenge. Of the 20 countries in protracted crisis
identified above, only one, Ethiopia, has reached the
MDG 1c target. All the others report either insufficient
progress or even deterioration.

Food security and nutrition: the drivers of change

■■ The typology of crises
Over the past 30 years, the typology of crises has gradually
evolved from catastrophic, short-term, acute and highly
visible events to more structural, longer-term and protracted
situations resulting from a combination of multiple
contributing factors, especially natural disasters and conflicts,
with climate change, financial and price crises increasingly
frequent among the exacerbating factors. In other words,
protracted crises have become the new norm, while acute
short-term crises are now the exception. Indeed, more crises
are considered protracted today than in the past.60
From a food security and nutrition perspective, in 1990, only
12 countries in Africa were facing food crises, of which only
four were in protracted crisis. Just 20 years later, a total of 24
countries were facing food crises, with 19 of these having been in
crisis for eight or more of the previous ten years.61 Moreover,
the growing imperative of dealing with the long-term contexts
of these emergencies is becoming evident. For instance, the

Bosphorus Compact62 reported that global humanitarian appeals
between 2004 and 2013 increased by 446 percent overall – rising
from US$3 billion to US$16.4 billion. Similarly, the number of
displaced people at the end of 2013 was 51.2 million, more than
at any point since the end of World War Two. The average length
of displacement in major refugee situations is now 20 years. And
nine out of ten humanitarian appeals continue for more than three
years, with 78 percent of spending by the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development’s Development
Assistance Committee donors allocated to protracted emergencies.
Over the past three decades, the causes of crises have
become more interconnected, displaying an evolving trend of
triggers for protracted crises due to natural causes, either humaninduced, or stemming from a combination of human and natural
causes.63 Conflicts are increasingly the main underlying cause,
with the prevalence of human-induced conflicts higher than
previously. As such, conflicts are now a common feature of crises.
The complex relation between conflict and food security and
nutrition is still to be fully explored (Box 4).

BOX 4

Conflict and political instability

Food insecurity can be a direct result of violent conflict and
political instability as well as an exacerbating factor. On the
one hand, food insecurity is among the factors that can
trigger and/or deepen conflict, often due to underlying
economic and structural factors. For instance, sudden and
unforeseen food price rises, or the reduction or removal of
subsidies on basic foodstuffs, can be a catalyst for civil and
political unrest, as in the social upheaval and political
violence of the Arab Spring in 2011 when governments in
the Near East reduced subsidies for bread. Natural disasters,
drought and famine can also contribute to political unrest
and violent conflict, as evidenced by the Sahel and West
Africa region. Food insecurity can exacerbate political
instability and violent conflict when specific groups are
economically marginalized, services are distributed
inequitably or where there is competition over scarce natural
resources needed for food security. Periodic conflicts
between farmers and herders in the semi-arid Sahel and East
Africa regions illustrate this.1
On the other hand, mortality caused by conflict due to
food insecurity and famine can far exceed deaths caused
directly by violence. Conflict disrupts livelihoods in rural and
urban areas, and undermines smallholder agricultural
productivity; it is a leading cause of hunger and undermines
food security and nutrition in multiple ways. All situations of
extreme food insecurity and famine in the Horn of Africa
since the 1980s have been characterized by conflict in some
form, transforming food security crises into devastating

38

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2015

famines. Globally, between 2004 and 2009, around 55 000
people lost their lives each year as a direct result of conflict or
terrorism.2 In contrast, famine caused by conflict and
drought resulted in the deaths of more than 250 000 people
in Somalia alone between 2010 and 2012.3
Figures from ongoing conflicts and political instability
reinforce this link. In Iraq, food prices are high and volatile in
conflict-affected governorates, with the food basket costing
25–30 percent more than in the capital Baghdad.4 Stressed
crop conditions are clearly visible through satellite imaging,
which confirms the negative impact of the conflict on
irrigation, availability of agricultural inputs and access to
fields. In Palestine, displacement, livelihood disruption and
increasing unemployment has led to a recent deterioration in
food security. In 2013, 33 percent of all Palestinians were
considered to be food-insecure (19 percent in the West Bank
and 57 percent in the Gaza Strip), with a further 16 percent
considered to be particularly vulnerable to becoming foodinsecure.5 At the start of 2015, as a result of continuing
violence, civil unrest and fragmentation in the Syrian Arab
Republic, coupled with international sanctions, disrupted
food production and hikes in domestic fuel and food prices,
9.8 million people required various levels of food, agriculture
and livelihood-related assistance. Of these, 6.8 million people
were in critical need of food assistance.6
In South Sudan, between January and March 2015, some
2.5 million people were facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or
Emergency (IPC Phase 4) levels of food insecurity7 as the

Food security and nutrition: the drivers of change

■■ Ways in which crises impact food security
Protracted crises undermine food security and nutrition in
multiple ways, affecting the availability, access and utilization of
food. Disruptions to crop production, livestock rearing and trade
can have a negative impact on food availability. People’s access
to food is frequently affected in crises because of displacement,
disruptions to livelihoods, or when land is taken. For example,
when state and customary institutions are unable or unwilling to
protect and promote individuals’ legal rights, attempts to take
land from women, orphans and other vulnerable individuals go
unchecked.64 Finally, the utilization of food can be impacted by
changes in intra-household and community relations and power
dynamics and by inequitable service delivery.
Food insecurity can be further deepened and selfperpetuating as people use up their reserves of food, finance
and other assets, and turn to unsustainable coping mechanisms,
such as selling off productive assets and taking up activities that
lead to land degradation to meet immediate food needs.

conflict had displaced populations, reduced food production
and disrupted markets.8 It is worth noting that prior to the
eruption of conflict in December 2013, no one in South
Sudan was in IPC Phase 4. The immediate effects of the
conflict on the food security situation were highlighted by
the revised IPC analysis in May 2014, which reported some
3.5 million people in IPC Phases 3 and 4, of which more
than 1 million were facing Emergency (Phase 4) level.9
Similarly, the conflict in the Central African Republic has
exacerbated food insecurity. In April–May 2014, IPC
estimated (although with limited confidence) that roughly
1.7 million people were severely food-insecure (IPC Phases 3

Gender and age are two powerful determinants of the
impact of protracted crises on individuals. Women are more
likely than men to be affected and their access to aid can be
undermined by gender-based discrimination. Pre-existing
gender-based disparities in access to assets such as land,
property or credit mean that women have often fewer
financial resources than men to cope with impacts such as
loss of productive capacity, leaving them unable to afford the
increased prices of food in crisis-affected areas.65 Protracted
crises have also been found to put additional care burdens
on women post-crisis, while limited mobility and work
opportunities outside the home reduce their range of coping
strategies. Often, with male household members absent, due
to death, migration or recruitment into armed forces,
women are not always able to claim family assets, such as
land, livestock, tools and machinery, previously owned by
their husbands, especially if they are illiterate or insufficiently
aware of their legal rights with significant negative
implications for food security.

and 4).10 This was a sharp increase from 900 000 people
estimated in November 2013, prior to the outbreak of
conflict.
In all these examples, it is likely that the major causes of
current food insecurity will persist for some time, with
households increasingly adopting short-term coping and
survival strategies that can render livelihoods unsustainable
and jeopardise future prospects, for example selling
productive assets such as livestock, or remaining heavily
reliant on food assistance. In such contexts, progress
towards the MDG 1c target in these countries is likely to be
extremely difficult to achieve.

Food security and nutrition: the drivers of change

BOX 5

Threats of natural disasters and climate change to food security

Exposure to natural hazards and disasters is a major cause of
food insecurity, a problem exacerbated by climate change.
Between 2003 and 2013, natural hazards and disasters in the
developing regions affected more than 1.9 billion people and
resulted in nearly half a trillion US dollars in estimated
damage. Through a review of post-disaster needs
assessments in 48 developing countries, FAO estimated that
the agriculture sector absorbs approximately 22 percent of
the total economic impact of these disasters,1 clearly
affecting the capacity of the sector to support food security.
Small island developing states (SIDS) are at particular risk.2
The World Bank estimates that SIDS countries account for
two-thirds of the countries incurring the highest relative
losses due to natural disasters each year. In the Pacific
Islands region alone, infrastructure, buildings and cash crops
with an estimated value of US$112 billion are considered to
be at risk of natural disasters.3 In the Caribbean, annual
damage to infrastructure from natural disasters is estimated
between US$0.5 to 1.0 billion.4
Climate change multiplies the risks of natural hazards,
through altered rainfall and temperature patterns as well as
increased frequency and intensity of extreme events such as
drought and flooding.5 The Fifth Assessment Report of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, released in
2014, noted that climate change is already having a
negative impact on agriculture, affecting major crops,
livestock production and fisheries. These tropical areas of
high exposure to climate change are also characterized by
high food insecurity.
When disasters strike, they have immediate repercussions on
the livelihoods and food security of millions of family farmers
and smallholders, pastoralists, fishers and forest-dependent
communities in developing countries where agriculture
employs from 30 to over 80 percent of the population.
Considering only the impacts of major events for a limited
number of countries over the 2003–13 period, estimates of
losses were about US$13 billion for the crop sector, mainly due
to flooding and storm damage and US$11 billion for
livestock, principally attributable to drought, and these are
only a small fraction of the total costs actually incurred.6
Natural disasters also have a wide and complex range of
indirect effects on food security. Greater uncertainty and higher
risks reduce the incentives to invest in agricultural production,
particularly for family farmers and smallholders with limited
or no access to credit and insurance.7 Greater emphasis on
low-risk, but low-returning production activities, and lowered
levels of fixed and operating capital inputs, generally lead to
both lower current and future farm profits. Natural disasters
also give rise to reductions in food consumption, education

40

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2015

and healthcare, which, in turn, can lead to long-term losses
in terms of income generation and future food security. In
the United Republic of Tanzania, for example, crop shocks
going back to 1991–95 provoked consumption growth
losses of between 17 and 40 percent in 2004.8
Taken together, exposure to natural disasters, exacerbated
by climate change, can pose significant challenges to
countries in their progress towards the international hunger
targets. Reducing vulnerability to natural hazards and climate
change requires a comprehensive strategy to minimize risk
exposure while maximizing effective responses. This includes
increasing the resilience of agro-ecosystems through
sustainable land management approaches, together with
programmes to enhance socio-economic resilience such as
social protection, improved agricultural market governance
and value chain development, as well as insurance
programmes and effective early warning systems. Resiliencebuilding is specific to local conditions and thus capacity to
identify and implement strategies at local level is key.
Empirical evidence from various countries has shown that
implementing disaster risk-reduction measures can produce
long-term benefits – from reduced future losses to more
resilient livelihoods and productive agro-ecosystems.
Countries such as Bangladesh, Cuba, Madagascar and
Viet Nam have been able to reduce drastically the impact of
weather related hazards, such as tropical storms and floods,
through improved early warning systems and other disasterpreparedness and risk-reduction measures.9

Food security and nutrition: the drivers of change

■■ Why is it so difficult to deal with food
insecurity and malnutrition in protracted
crises?
Addressing food insecurity and malnutrition in protracted
crises is particularly challenging. Evidence shows that
stakeholders need to address the critical manifestations of
protracted crises, such as hunger and malnutrition, and
disruption to and depletion of livelihoods, while
simultaneously addressing underlying causes such as poor
governance, inadequate capacities, limited access to scarce
natural resources and conflict.
In addition, policies and actions have to consider the
specific features and complex challenges presented by
protracted crises, including their longevity; the particular need
to protect marginalized and vulnerable groups, and to respect
basic human rights; the mismatch between short-term
funding mechanisms and long-term needs, and how best to
integrate humanitarian and development assistance; the
often poor coordination of responses; and inadequate
ownership by national stakeholders of response-related
processes. Finally, the context specificity of protracted crises

makes it difficult, and undesirable, to adopt “one-size-fits-all”
approaches.
Nonetheless, examples exist of good practices in addressing
some of the issues at the root of protracted crises, ranging
from innovative funding mechanisms such as crisis modifiers,
to more comprehensive country owned processes (see Box 6
for more details). In addition, rural women should be seen as
partners in the rehabilitation process rather than simply
“victims”. Indeed, evidence indicates that relief programmes
that adopt a gender perspective can avert widespread
malnutrition and lead to quick and more extensive recovery in
food production and other aspects of livelihoods.66
Protracted crises are becoming an increasingly important
global problem, negatively impacting on people’s food
security and nutrition, and often the result of instability and
conflict. Successful experiences exist, but need to be scaled
up, which requires a high degree of political commitment at
all levels (see Box 7). Current efforts by the Committee on
World Food Security (CFS) to finalize a Framework for Action
for Food Security and Nutrition in Protracted Crises could be
an important first step to mobilize political commitment and
guide action.

BOX 6

Crisis modifiers as innovative financing mechanisms

Crisis modifiers are budget lines in longer-term
interventions that can quickly shift programmatic
objectives towards mitigation of a crisis without going
through the lengthy process of fund-raising and proposal
writing. This mechanism enables a more integrated, agile
and flexible approach that can reduce the erosion of
development gains in times of crisis while responding to
immediate needs. As such, it is a valuable approach to
sequencing and integrating humanitarian and
development assistance around the shared goal of
building resilience. This approach was pioneered by the
United States Agency for International Development
(USAID) / Office of United States Foreign Disaster
Assistance (OFDA) in Ethiopia to shift development
funding to deliver immediate, life-saving interventions in
response to the 2011 drought.
Shift toward comprehensive risk management
A range of sophisticated risk management models at
continental, national and community levels are being
rolled out to provide contingency funding to governments
and insurance to farmers in the event of a severe drought
or other natural disasters. The African Risk Capacity (ARC)
is one such example. ARC is a novel partnership, between
the African Union, UN agencies, philanthropic foundations

and aid providers, which aims to be an “… Africa-owned,
standalone financial entity that will provide African
governments with timely, reliable and cost-effective
contingency funding in the event of a severe drought by
pooling risks across the continent”.1 ARC translates
country-specific rainfall data into an approximate
“response cost”. Countries pay premiums, based on
probable risks, to an index-based insurance mechanism –
thus pooling the risk of drought across several countries
and taking advantage of the weather system diversity
across Africa. There are analogous community-level
systems such the R4 Rural Resilience Initiative in Ethiopia
and Senegal to support resilience to climate variability and
shocks. Insurance and other innovative financing
mechanisms are not stand-alone solutions, but elements
that should be considered as part of a more
comprehensive package that reduces risks, supports
livelihoods and protects assets in crisis situations.

BOX 7

Addressing food security and nutrition issues in protracted crisis situations: success story

Successful interventions in addressing food security and
nutrition issues in protracted crisis situations are often
seen to be more about preventive actions than
responses to the impacts of recurrent crises. One
positive country example in dealing with recurrent food
security crises is Ethiopia, which recently reached the
MDG 1c hunger target.
The positive results can be attributed to several
interlinked factors: first, an unprecedented GDP annual
growth rate of 10 percent, and second, a political shift
from humanitarian and emergency interventions towards
longer-term interventions aimed at dealing with the
structural causes of hunger, vulnerability and poverty in

the most vulnerable and resource-depleted areas of the
country. Until 2005, short-term, mainly food-aid-driven
responses were the standard response to such events.
Since 2005, the Government has implemented a
widespread social protection programme, the Productive
Safety Net Programme (PSNP). This reaches some
7.5 million vulnerable people through a cash/food-forwork approach. The added value is that, while providing
the most vulnerable groups with adequate entitlements
to access food, it also enables them to combat the
structural causes of food insecurity, for example by
improving agricultural activities and investing in rural
infrastructure.

Key findings
• Economic growth is necessary for sustaining
progress in efforts to reduce poverty, hunger and
malnutrition. But it is not sufficient.
• Inclusive growth – growth that provides
opportunities for those with meagre assets, skills
and opportunities – improves the incomes and
livelihoods of the poor, and is effective in the
fight against hunger and malnutrition. Rural
people make up a high percentage of the hungry
and malnourished in developing countries, and
efforts to promote growth in agriculture and the
rural sector can be an important component of a
strategy for promoting inclusive growth and
improving food security and nutrition.
• Improving the productivity of resources held by
family farmers and smallholders is, in most cases,
an essential element of inclusive growth and has
broad implications for the livelihoods of the rural
poor and for the rural economy in general. Wellfunctioning markets for food, inputs and labour
can help to integrate family farmers and
smallholders in the rural economy and enable the
rural poor to diversify their livelihoods, which is
critical for managing risk, and reducing hunger
and malnutrition.

42

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2015

• In many situations, international trade
openness has an important potential for
improving food security and nutrition by
increasing food availability and for promoting
investment and growth. International trade
agreements should provide for effective
safeguards and greater policy space for
developing countries to avoid detrimental
effects on domestic food security and nutrition.
• Social protection directly contributes to the
reduction of hunger and malnutrition by
promoting income security and access to better
nutrition, healthcare and education. By
increasing human capacities and mitigating the
impact of shocks, social protection fosters the
ability of the very poor to participate in the
growth process through better access to decent
employment.
• Prevalence of food insecurity and malnutrition
is significantly higher in protracted crisis
contexts resulting from conflict and natural
disasters. Strong political commitment is
necessary to address the root causes of
protracted crises situations. Action should focus
on addressing vulnerability, respecting basic
human rights and integrating humanitarian
and development assistance.

Methodology for assessing food security
and progress towards the international hunger targets

Suite of food security indicators
Food security is a complex phenomenon, manifested in numerous physical conditions with multiple causes. The State of Food
Insecurity in the World 2013 introduced a suite of food security indicators, which measures separately the four dimensions of
food security to allow a more nuanced assessment of food insecurity.
Updated data for the suite of food security indicators can be viewed and downloaded from FAOSTAT (at http://faostat3.
fao.org/download/D/FS/E) and the FAO website (at http://www.fao.org/economic/ess/ess-fs/ess-fadata/en/).

programmes, ensuring a smooth transition towards a distribution
in which food consumption is symmetric.

■■ Estimating and projecting mean food consumption
The FAO prevalence of undernourishment (PoU) indicator measures
the probability that a randomly selected individual from the
reference population is found to consume less than his/her calorie
requirement for an active and healthy life. It is written as:

where f(x) is the probability density function of per capita calorie
consumption. The probability distribution used to infer the habitual
levels of dietary energy consumption in a population, f(x), refers to
a typical level of daily energy consumption during a year. The
probability distribution f(x) and the minimum dietary energy
requirement (MDER) are associated with a representative individual
of the population, of average age, sex, stature and physical activity
level.
Estimating the PoU requires the identification of a functional
form for f(x), chosen from a parametric family. The parameters that
characterize f(x) are the mean level of per capita dietary energy
consumption (DEC) in calories; the MDER; the coefficient of
variation (CV) as a parameter accounting for inequality in food
consumption; and a skewness (SK) parameter accounting for
asymmetry in the distribution.
To implement this methodology it is necessary to: (i) choose a
functional form for the distribution of food consumption f(x); (ii)
identify values for the three parameters, that is, for mean food
consumption (DEC), its variability (CV) and its asymmetry (SK); and
(iii) compute the MDER threshold.

■■ The choice of a functional form for the distribution
Starting from the Sixth World Food Survey in 1996,1 the
distribution was assumed to be lognormal. This model is
convenient for analytical purposes, but has limited flexibility,
especially in capturing the skewness of the distribution.
As part of the revisions made for the 2012 edition of The State
of Food Insecurity in the World, the methodology moved away
from the exclusive use of the two-parameter lognormal distribution
to adopt the more flexible three-parameter skew-normal and
skew-lognormal families.2 The flexibility gained from the additional
parameter allows for independent characterization of the
asymmetry of the distribution.
As a further refinement, the data themselves are used in this
report to inform the decision regarding the appropriate
distributional form.3 In this way, the empirical skewness from the
distribution of per capita calorie consumption derived from
national household surveys (NHS)4 is applied as a selection
criterion. Using the skewness implied by the lognormal as an upper
limit for the level of asymmetry, the skew-lognormal, which
embeds the lognormal as a special case, is used as an intermediate
step to the skew-normal distribution, which itself is a more general
form of the normal distribution. The resulting model makes it
possible to account for reductions in inequality of food
consumption, such as those made by targeted food intervention

To compute per capita DEC in a country, FAO has traditionally
relied on food balance sheets, which are available for more than
180 countries. In most countries, this choice was due mainly to the
lack of suitable surveys conducted regularly. Through data on
production, trade and utilization of food commodities, the total
amount of dietary energy available for human consumption in a
country for a one-year period is derived using food composition
data, allowing computation of an estimate of per capita dietary
energy supply.
During the revision for The State of Food Insecurity in the World
2012, a parameter that captures food losses during distribution at
the retail level was introduced in an attempt to obtain more
accurate values of per capita consumption. Region-specific calorie
losses were estimated from data provided in a recent FAO study5
and ranged from 2 percent of the quantity distributed for dry
grains, to 10 percent for perishable products, such as fresh fruits
and vegetables.
The last period for which the PoU is estimated is the three-year
average 2014–16. This choice arises from the need to maintain
consistency with previous assessments of undernourishment –
which were based on three-year averages since 1990–92 – and the
monitoring of the Millennium Development Goals and the World
Food Summit goal, which ends in 2015 (see next section). The last
period has to be a three-year average centred on year 2015, that
is, 2014–16. Therefore, per capita DEC needs to be computed and
projected up to the year 2016.
The latest available data from food balance sheets refer to year
2013 for most countries,6 while for other countries data are
available only until 2011. Therefore, additional sources were
needed to estimate the DEC for the subsequent years. The main
source of missing data for 2012, 2013 and 2014 are the food
consumption estimates from the short-term market outlook
prepared by the Trade and Markets Division (EST) of FAO. The
Division computes per capita availability of major commodities –
cereals, meats, oilseeds and sugar – for most countries of the
world. These estimates were used to pro-rate the food balance
sheet data to arrive at forecasts for 2012, 2013 and 2014. These
forecasts are updated every six months, and need to be
supplemented by projections for the most recent years.
The Holt-Winters distributed lag model was used to project the
DEC for 2015 and 2016; in some cases, this model was also applied
to compute projections for 2014, when EST data were not available
or unreliable. The Holt-Winters model uses a process known as
exponential smoothing, which attributes higher weights to more
recent data and progressively less weight to older observations.
Weights decrease in each period by a constant amount, which lies
on an exponential curve. Where the Holt-Winters distributed lag
model did not produce plausible results, simpler forecasting
methods were used, such as linear or exponential trend
extrapolations. For some countries, particularly where EST estimates
appeared to provide implausible results, the econometric
forecasting had to be applied for the whole projection period.

Annex 2
■■ Estimating coefficients of variation and skewness7
A new data treatment method
Variability (CV) and skewness (SK) parameters are derived from NHS
wherever they are available and reliable. These surveys typically
collect information on food as part of the expenditure module.
Data from these surveys, when taken as observations of individual
habitual consumption, are affected by high variability. It is therefore
essential to apply data treatment methods before parameters are
estimated. This is especially the case for the SK parameter, which is
sensitive to the presence of extreme values.8
The method applied in this edition of The State of Food
Insecurity in the World to assess the robustness of statistics for a
sample is known as the “leave-out-one cross-validation”
approach. With this approach, for a sample of size n, subsamples
of size (n – 1) are created in which each observation is
systematically left out of one subsample. For each subsample, the
sensitivity of the statistic of interest – in this case, the SK
parameter – to the excluded observation can be analysed, and
observations that have a large impact are removed. The method
allows a robust calculation of the SK parameter that is insensitive
to any single observation found in the dataset.

Controlling for excess variability
As the original purpose of NHS is to measure the levels and changes
in living conditions of the population, the data collected typically
pertain to food acquisition over a given reference period. However,
the aim of the food security analyses in this report is to capture
habitual food consumption, which is expected to be less variable
than food acquisition. Therefore, excess variability is controlled by
assuming a stable relationship between income and consumption in
calories, which nets out excess variability caused by some
households boosting their food stocks while other households
deplete theirs. In the past, this control for excess variability has been
accomplished by grouping household food consumption levels
according to income deciles.9
In this edition of The State of Food Insecurity in the World, an
extension of the method described above is used, based on a
linear regression linking the log of per capita income to per capita
calorie consumption, along with indicator variables for the month
in which the survey was conducted, to control for seasonality. The
regression can be written as:

where PPCi is the per capita calorie consumption for household i,
β0 is an intercept term, β1 is a regression parameter defining the
linear relationship between the log of income and food consumption,
and Monthj,i is an indicator variable with value 1 if the survey for
household i took place in month j. The variability in food
consumption due to income is then calculated from the fitted values
of the regression adjusted for seasonality.

A new estimation of indirect CVs
The procedure described so far is used in countries where one or
more reliable NHS are available. Where this is not the case, so-called

50

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2015

indirect estimates for the variability in food consumption are used.
Indirect CVs were estimated by using the relationships between the
CVs obtained from available household survey data and some key
macroeconomic variables. In the past, the PoU indicator
methodology was frequently criticized for holding CVs – which
account for inequality in food consumption – constant over time for
most countries.10 This practice does not take into account economic
progress within a country and changes in the distribution of food
consumption. To address this issue, in this report, indirect estimates
have been updated from the year 2000 onwards by using a revised
relationship among the CVs due to income and macroeconomic
variables that also takes into account changes in food prices.
To fully investigate the effects of food price changes on food
access, measures of national prices should be used. In
collaboration with the World Bank, FAO has developed a relative
price of food indicator using data from the International
Comparison Program11 and consumer food price indices available
on FAOSTAT.12 The indicator is designed to capture changes in
domestic food prices that are comparable over time and among
countries. The ratio of food and general consumption in
purchasing power parity (PPP) terms is projected forwards and
backwards in time using the ratio of the country’s consumer food
price index to the country’s general consumer price index, relative
to that of the United States of America.
Using the most comprehensive dataset of Gini coefficients
available,13 a regression has been used to relate the variability in
food consumption due to income to the log of GDP, the Gini
coefficient, and the log of the relative price of food indicator. The
GDP and relative price of food indicators are included on the logscale, implying that changes in these variables at low values will
have a larger impact on the CV due to income. To ensure crosscountry comparability at different points in time, per capita GDP in
constant 2005 international dollars in PPP terms, calculated by the
World Bank, has been used. Regional indicators have been included
for Africa, the Americas, Asia, and Western Asia. An interaction
term between the GDP and the relative food price indicator has
been included to allow for differential effects of the price of food at
different levels of GDP. As there are multiple observations – more
than one survey – for some countries, a weighted regression was
used in which each observation is weighted by one over the
number of surveys for that country.
With the parameters from the regression described above, the
variability in food consumption due to income has been updated
for countries with available Gini coefficients and available data on
the relative price of food and GDP. Note that the Gini coefficients
in the World Bank database differ in terms of whether they are
calculated with reference to the household or the individual,
consumption or expenditure, and gross or net income – these
differences can make comparability across different types of Gini
coefficient difficult.14 For this reason, care was taken to ensure
that the same type of Gini calculation was used within a single
country and, to maintain cross-country comparability, only relative
changes in the predicted values from the regression were used to
update the CV parameter. The resulting updates take into account
economic progress in a country as well as changes in relative food
prices, allowing for a more complete picture of inequality in food
consumption.

Annex 2
A new computation of variability due to requirement
To obtain the total variability in food consumption used to
calculate the PoU, the variability that is due to income (
) is
added to the variability due to all other factors that are not
correlated with income (
):

Much of the variability orthogonal to income is due to
differences in energy requirement, which are in turn largely
determined by population structure as well as by physical activity
levels, lifestyles, access to safe drinking-water, and progress in
health care and disease reduction. Previous analyses showed small
variability in this subcomponent across countries and over time,
compared with the income component, and the variability due to
requirement has been maintained at a fixed value.
To take into account the world’s rapidly changing population
structure,15 time-varying country estimates for the variability in food
consumption due to requirement have been calculated. Using
estimates for the average dietary energy requirement by sex and age
class16 and corresponding population ratios17 as weights, the
variance due to requirement is estimated for a given country in a
given year. Further work is under way to capture the rest of the
variability that is orthogonal to income. The revision discussed here
allows estimates of the variability in food consumption to reflect
more accurately demographic differences across countries and
demographic evolution within a country.

■■ Estimating the MDER threshold
To calculate the MDER threshold, FAO uses normative energy
requirement standards from a joint FAO/WHO/United Nations
University expert consultation in 2001. These standards are obtained
by calculating the needs for basic metabolism – that is, the energy
expended by the human body in a state of rest – and multiplying
them by a factor that takes into account physical activity, referred to
as the physical activity level (PAL) index.
As individual metabolic efficiency and physical activity levels vary
within population groups of the same age and sex, energy
requirements are expressed as ranges for such groups. To derive the
MDER threshold, the minimum of each range for adults and
adolescents is specified on the basis of the distribution of ideal body
weights and the mid-point of the values of the physical activity level
(PAL) index associated with a sedentary lifestyle (1.55). The lowest
body weight for a given height that is compatible with good health
is estimated from the fifth percentile of the distribution of body
mass indices in healthy populations.
Once the minimum requirement for each sex-age group has been
established, the population-level MDER threshold is obtained as a
weighted average, considering the relative frequency of individuals in
each group as weights. The threshold is determined with reference to
light physical activity, normally associated with a sedentary lifestyle.
However, this does not negate the fact that the population also
includes individuals engaged in moderate and intense physical
activity. It is just one way of avoiding the overestimation of food
inadequacy when only food consumption levels are observed that
cannot be individually matched to the varying requirements.

A frequent misconception when assessing food inadequacy
based on observed food consumption data is to refer to the midpoint in the overall range of requirements as a threshold for
identifying inadequate energy consumption in the population. This
would lead to significantly biased estimates: even in groups
composed of only well-nourished people, roughly half of these
individuals will have intake levels below mean requirements, as the
group will include people engaged in low physical activity. Using the
mean requirement as a threshold would certainly produce an
overestimate, as all adequately nourished individuals with less than
average requirements would be misclassified as undernourished.18
MDER thresholds are updated every two years based on regular
revisions of the population assessments of the United Nations
Population Division and data on population heights from various
sources, most notably the Monitoring and Evaluation to Assess and
Use Results of Demographic and Health Surveys project
coordinated by the United States Agency for International
Development (USAID). This edition of The State of Food Insecurity
in the World uses updated population estimates from the 2012
revision published by the United Nations Population Division in
June 2013. When data on population heights are not available,
reference is made either to data on heights from countries where
similar ethnicities prevail, or to models that use partial information
to estimate heights for various sex and age classes.

■■ Limitations of the methodology and frequent
critiques
The FAO methodology for estimating undernourishment has been
subject to long-standing and wide debate. The methodology suffers
from several limitations, which need to be acknowledged and taken
into account when analysing the results presented in this report.
First, the indicator is based on a narrow definition of hunger,
covering only chronically inadequate dietary energy intake lasting for
over one year. Energy intake is a very specific aspect of food
insecurity, which applies where conditions are more severe.
Individuals experiencing difficulties in obtaining enough food are
likely to switch towards cheaper sources of energy and to
compromise the quality of their food intake in a way that can create
substantial damage.19 To address this limitation, the FAO suite of
food security indicators has been presented since the 2013 edition
of The State of Food Insecurity in the World. The suite comprises
indicators that reflect a broader concept of food insecurity and
hunger and allows consideration of their multifaceted nature.
Second, the PoU indicator cannot capture within-year
fluctuations in the capacity to acquire enough energy from food,
which may themselves be causes of significant stresses for the
population. Within-year fluctuations can also affect the quality of
the diet, as consumers will resort to cheaper foods during periods
when access becomes more difficult.
Third, the FAO methodology for computing undernourishment
cannot take into account any bias that may exist in intra-household
distribution of foods,20 such as that arising from cultural habits or
gender-based habits and beliefs. As seen, the parameters that
describe the distribution of food across the population are derived
from household-level surveys, rather than from information that
refers to individuals.

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2015

51

Annex 2
A final and significant limitation of the FAO methodology for
computing the prevalence of undernourishment is that it does not
provide information on the degree of severity of the food insecurity
conditions experienced by a population. The parametric model
described in this annex only allows for estimates of the
undernourished share in a population, but is silent about the
composition of undernourishment within that part of the population.
In the debate on measuring undernourishment, the FAO
methodology has attracted two frequent criticisms:
• The indicator underestimates undernourishment, as it assumes a
level of physical activity associated with a sedentary lifestyle, while
poor people are often engaged in physically demanding activities.
• The methodology is based on macrodata, whereas microdata from
surveys allow accurate measurement of food consumption.
On the first criticism, ideally, undernourishment should be assessed
at the individual level by comparing individual energy requirements
with individual energy intakes. This would enable the classification of
each person in the population as undernourished or not. However,
this approach is not feasible for two reasons: individual energy
requirements are practically unobservable with standard data
collection methods; and individual food consumption is currently
measured with precision in only a few countries and for relatively
limited samples. The individual-level consumption data that can be
estimated from NHS are largely approximated owing to disparities in
intra-household food allocation, the variability of individual energy
requirements, and the day-to-day variability of food consumption that
can arise for reasons independent of food insecurity. The solution
adopted by FAO has been to estimate the PoU with reference to the
population as a whole, summarized through a representative
individual, and to combine available microdata on food consumption
with macrodata. Within the population, there is a range of values for
energy requirements that are compatible with healthy status, given
that body weight, metabolic efficiency and physical activity levels vary.
It follows that only values below the minimum of such a range can be
associated with undernourishment, in a probabilistic sense. Hence, for
the PoU to indicate that a randomly selected individual in a
population is undernourished, the appropriate threshold is the lower
end of the range of energy requirements.
As for the second criticism, the FAO methodology in fact combines
available microdata on food consumption derived from surveys with
macrodata from food balance sheets. Food balance sheets provide
information on the amount of food that is available for consumption
after taking into account all possible alternative uses of the food
items; hence, they provide approximate measures of per capita
consumption, which are available for a large number of countries and
are comparable. The methodology adopted for computing these data
is currently under revision, together with the estimates of waste
parameters used to derive the DEC, so the level of accuracy is
expected to increase in the next few years. Survey data, where
available and reliable, are used in the FAO methodology to compute
the variability (CV) and skewness (SK) parameters that characterize
the distribution of food consumption f(x). It is therefore essential that
household surveys collecting food consumption data are improved to
obtain more accurate measures of undernourishment. Such
improvements will require both promoting greater standardization
across NHS, and conducting more refined surveys that capture food
intake at the individual level. At the moment, few surveys accurately

52

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2015

capture habitual food consumption at the individual level and collect
sufficient information on the anthropometric characteristics and
activity levels of each surveyed individual; in other words, very few
surveys would allow for an estimation of the relevant energy
requirement threshold at the individual level.
To conclude, the quality of the PoU estimates depends heavily
on the quality of the background data used in the estimation.
Hence, to obtain better estimates of undernourishment it is
important to improve food consumption data through the design
and implementation of high-quality nationally representative
surveys that are comparable over time and across countries.

Criteria for identifying countries that
have reached the MDG 1c hunger target
and the 1996 World Food Summit goal
Following the recommendation of the Committee on World Food
Security (CFS),21 countries that have reached the two targets have
been identified on the basis of the number of undernourished and
the PoU.
The 1996 World Food Summit goal was defined in the Rome
Declaration on World Food Security,22 in which the representatives
of 182 governments pledged “... to eradicate hunger in all
countries, with an immediate view to reducing the number of
undernourished people to half their present level no later than
2015.” Estimates of the number of undernourished were used by
FAO as a basis to monitor progress towards this goal.
With the establishment of the Millennium Development Goals,
progress indicators were identified for each goal, to track progress at
national and global levels. The reference period was identified as the
25 years between 1990 and 2015. The first MDG, or MDG 1,
includes three distinct targets:
• halving global poverty;
• achieving full and productive employment and decent work for
all; and
• halving the proportion of people who suffer from hunger by 2015.
The progress indicator for the third target, known as Target 1c,
is the PoU.
FAO began monitoring progress towards the WFS and the
MDG 1c hunger targets at the end of 1990s, using the three-year
period 1990–92 as a starting point. Both targets are to be reached
by the end of 2015. To maintain consistency with the initial time
period and the definition of the targets of the MDGs, progress has
been assessed up to a three-year average period centred on 2015,
that is, 2014–16.
At the same time, achievement of all the MDGs is meant to be
assessed for the 25-year period, from 1990 to 2015, but for the PoU,
observations were only available for the 24-year period from 1990–92
and 2014–16. To address this potential inconsistency, the 50 percent
reduction in the number of undernourished and the PoU needed to
reach the WFS and the MDG 1c hunger targets, respectively, has been
adjusted by a factor of 24/25. In practice, this means that a cut-off
point of 48 percent has been used.

country level, it is calculated as the food remaining for human use after
deduction of all non-food utilizations (i.e. food = production +
imports + stock withdrawals − exports − industrial use − animal feed –
seed – wastage − additions to stock). Wastage includes losses of usable
products occurring along distribution chains from farm gate (or port of
import) up to the retail level.
Dietary energy supply adequacy. Dietary energy supply as a percentage of
the average dietary energy requirement.
Food insecurity. A situation that exists when people lack secure access to
sufficient amounts of safe and nutritious food for normal growth and
development and an active and healthy life. It may be caused by the
unavailability of food, insufficient purchasing power, inappropriate
distribution or inadequate use of food at the household level. Food
insecurity, poor conditions of health and sanitation and inappropriate
care and feeding practices are the major causes of poor nutritional
status. Food insecurity may be chronic, seasonal or transitory.
Food security. A situation that exists when all people, at all times, have
physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious
food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active
and healthy life. Based on this definition, four food security dimensions
can be identified: food availability, economic and physical access to
food, food utilization and stability over time.
Hunger. In this report the term hunger is used as being synonymous with
chronic undernourishment.
Kilocalorie (kcal). A unit of measurement of energy. One kilocalorie equals
1 000 calories. In the International System of Units (SI), the universal
unit of energy is the joule (J). One kilocalorie = 4.184 kilojoules (kJ).
Macronutrients. In this document, the proteins, carbohydrates and fats that
are available to be used for energy. They are measured in grams.
Malnutrition. An abnormal physiological condition caused by inadequate,
unbalanced or excessive consumption of macronutrients and/or
micronutrients. Malnutrition includes undernutrition and overnutrition
as well as micronutrient deficiencies.
Micronutrients. Vitamins, minerals and certain other substances that are
required by the body in small amounts. They are measured in
milligrams or micrograms.

Minimum dietary energy requirement (MDER). In a specified age/sex category,
the minimum amount of dietary energy per person that is considered
adequate to meet the energy needs at a minimum acceptable BMI of an
individual engaged in low physical activity. If referring to an entire
population, the minimum energy requirement is the weighted average of
the minimum energy requirements of the different age/sex groups. It is
expressed as kilocalories per person per day.
Nutrition security. A situation that exists when secure access to an
appropriately nutritious diet is coupled with a sanitary environment,
adequate health services and care, in order to ensure a healthy and
active life for all household members. Nutrition security differs from
food security in that it also considers the aspects of adequate caring
practices, health and hygiene in addition to dietary adequacy.
Nutrition-sensitive intervention. Interventions designed to address the underlying
determinants of nutrition (which include household food security, care for
mothers and children and primary health care services and sanitation) but
not necessarily having nutrition as the predominant goal.
Nutritional status. The physiological state of an individual that results from
the relationship between nutrient intake and requirements and from
the body’s ability to digest, absorb and use these nutrients.
Overnourishment. Food intake that is continuously in excess of dietary energy
requirements.
Overnutrition. A result of excessive food intake relative to dietary nutrient
requirements.
Overweight and obesity. Body weight that is above normal for height as a
result of an excessive accumulation of fat. It is usually a manifestation
of overnourishment. Overweight is defined as a BMI of more than 25
but less than 30 and obesity as a BMI of 30 or more.
Stunting. Low height for age, reflecting a past episode or episodes of
sustained undernutrition.
Undernourishment. A state, lasting for at least one year, of inability to acquire
enough food, defined as a level of food intake insufficient to meet
dietary energy requirements. For the purposes of this report, hunger
was defined as being synonymous with chronic undernourishment.
Undernutrition. The outcome of undernourishment, and/or poor absorption
and/or poor biological use of nutrients consumed as a result of repeated
infectious disease. It includes being underweight for one’s age, too short
for one’s age (stunted), dangerously thin for one’s height (wasted) and
deficient in vitamins and minerals (micronutrient malnutrition).
Underweight. Low weight for age in children, and BMI of less than 18.5 in
adults, reflecting a current condition resulting from inadequate food
intake, past episodes of undernutrition or poor health conditions.
Wasting. Low weight for height, generally the result of weight loss associated
with a recent period of starvation or disease.

The proportion of undernourished people
in the total population is the indicator
known as prevalence of
undernourishment (PoU). See Annexes 2
and 3 of this report for further details.

10 This is the region called “Middle Africa”
in the M49 country classification adopted
by the United Nations http://unstats.un.
org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm for
the full listing) and Table A1 in Annex 1.

2

Reference is made here to the developing
regions as defined by the M49 country
classification of the United Nations (see
http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/
m49regin.htm). Countries included in
these regions are also reported in
Annex 1, Table A1.

If China and India are excluded from the
aggregate of the developing regions, the
reduction in undernourishment follows a
more stable, continuous downward trend.
China and India alone account for
81 percent of the total reduction of the
number of undernourished people in the
developing regions between 1990–92
and 2014–16, and China alone accounts
for almost two-thirds.
Rome Declaration on World Food
Security, adopted at the World Food
Summit, Rome, 13–17 November 1996.
This is known as target 1c of Millennium
Development Goal 1 (MDG 1) (see http://
www.un.org/millenniumgoals/).
See Annex 2 for details on calculating
progress vis-à-vis target 1c of MDG 1 and
the 1996 WFS goal. The assessment of
progress towards these targets, started by
FAO at the end of the 1990s, took 1990–
92 as the base period. Both the WFS and
MDG hunger targets are to be reached by
the end of 2015. To maintain consistency,
progress has been assessed with reference
to a three-year average centred on 2015,
that is, 2014–16. Achievement of the
MDGs are meant to be assessed for the
25-year period, from 1990 to 2015, but,
as observations are only available for the
24-year period from 1990–92 to 2014–
16, the 50 percent change required for
reaching the targets has had to be
adjusted by a factor of 24/25. This
corresponds to a 48 percent reduction of
the PoU with respect to 1990–92.

7

The share of sub-Saharan Africa increased
from 45 percent to over 60 percent.

8

This is the case if the region is considered
without Sudan, which was recently added
to the Northern Africa subregion after the
partition of the country when South
Sudan became an independent state in
2011.

9

See note 6 and Annex 2 for details of the
assessment of countries that reached the
MDG 1c and WFS targets.

Current annual growth rates are, for
instance, 2.5 percent in the Gambia and
Ghana; 2.6 percent in Mauritania and
Togo; 2.7 percent in Benin and
Cameroon; 2.9 percent in Malawi, Mali,
Mozambique, Nigeria and Sao Tome and
Principe; and 3.2 percent in Angola. See
Population Reference Bureau. 2014.
World Population Data Sheet 2014

Publications/Datasheets/2014/2014world-population-data-sheet/data-sheet.
aspx).

12 Following the split of former Sudan into
two countries in 2011, South Sudan was
classified as part of sub-Saharan Africa,
while Sudan was added to Northern
Africa. In order to allow appropriate
assessments of progress between 1990–
92 and 2014–16, Sudan is not considered
in the Northern Africa region as reported
in Figure 4 and Table A1 in Annex 1.

Tajikistan in the 2013 edition of this
report.

17 Cyclone Pam with 270 km/hour winds, hit
Vanuatu as a category 5 cyclone, the

the Southern Pacific region.
18 One obvious methodological difference
between the two indicators is the
population coverage: underweight is
measured only for children below five
years of age, while undernourishment is
measured for the entire population. Other
differences relate to the way indicators
are compiled. The height and weight of
children are directly measured in
household surveys, while the availability
of and access to sufficient food are
estimated using a statistical model that
draws from multiple data sources (see
Annex 2).

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2015

19 The starting point for monitoring the CU5
was the year 1990, whereas it was 1990–
92 for the PoU. The last available data
point for CU5 is 2013, whereas for the
PoU it is 2014–16. Information for the
PoU and the CU5 is not available for the
same sets of countries. All comparisons
are therefore limited to regional
aggregates.
20 The Human Development Index was
0.399 in sub-Saharan Africa in 1990,
compared with a world average of 0.597.

Notes for Annex 1
Countries revise their official statistics regularly for the past as well as the latest reported
period. The same holds for population data of the United Nations. Whenever this
happens, FAO revises its estimates of undernourishment accordingly. Therefore, users are
advised to refer to changes in estimates over time only within the same edition of The
State of Food Insecurity in the World and refrain from comparing data published in editions
for different years.

1. World Food Summit goal: halve, between 1990–92 and 2015, the number of people
undernourished.
2. Millennium Development Goal 1, target 1c: halve, between 1990–92 and 2015, the
proportion of people suffering from undernourishment, or reduce this proportion
below 5 percent. Indicator 1.9 measures the proportion of the population below
the minimum level of dietary energy consumption (undernourishment). The results
are obtained following a harmonized methodology and are based on the latest
globally available data averaged over three years. Some countries may have more
recent data which, if used, could lead to different estimates of the prevalence of
undernourishment and consequently of the progress achieved.
3. Projection.
4. Change from the 1990–92 baseline. For countries that did not exist in the baseline
period, the 1990–92 proportion of undernourished is based on the 1993–95
proportion, while the number of people undernourished is based on this proportion of
their 1990–92 population. For countries where the prevalence of undernourishment is
estimated to be below 5 percent, the change in the number of people undernourished
since the 1990–92 baseline is only assessed as: achieving the WFS target, i.e.
reducing the number by more than half (<–50.0%); progress, but insufficient to
achieve the WFS target, i.e. reducing the number by less than half (>–50.0%); or an
increase in the number of people undernourished (>0.0%).
5. The colour indicator shows the progress achieved by 2014–16:

2015
The State of
Food Insecurity in the World
Meeting the 2015 international
hunger targets:
taking stock of uneven progress
This year´s annual State of Food Insecurity in the World report
takes stock of progress made towards achieving the internationally
established Millennium Development Goal (MDG1) and World Food
Summit hunger targets and reflects on what needs to be done,
as we transition to the new post-2015 Sustainable Development
Agenda. The report reviews progress made since 1990 for every
country and region as well as for the world as a whole.
Progress towards the MDG 1 target, however, is assessed not only
by measuring undernourishment, or hunger, but also by a second
indicator – the prevalence of underweight children under five years
of age. Progress for the two indicators across regions and over time,
is compared, providing insights into the complexity of food security.
Overall progress notwithstanding, much work remains to be done to
eradicate hunger and achieve food security across all its dimensions.
The 2015 report not only estimates the progress already achieved,
but also identifies remaining problems, and provides guidance
on which policies should be emphasized in the future. Key factors
that have determined success to date towards food security and
nutrition goals are identified. The list of factors – economic growth,
agricultural productivity growth, markets (including international
trade) and social protection – is by no means exhaustive. The report
also shows protracted crises, due to conflict or natural disasters,
has deleterious effects on progress in hunger reduction.
