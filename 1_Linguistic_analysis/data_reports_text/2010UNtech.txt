PREFACE

PREFACE

The increasing prevalence of malnutrition ‚Äì there are now an unprecedented one billion hungry people in our
world ‚Äì provides dramatic evidence of the severely strained capacity of many developing countries to meet
the minimum nutritional requirements of their people. Current estimates predict that the Earth will need to feed
an additional two to three billion people over the next 40 to 50 years. This will exert enormous pressure on the
productive capacity of agricultural systems across the world and will have important consequences for farmers
and consumers everywhere. Tackling this challenge requires a radical rethinking of how food is produced,
distributed and consumed globally.
Any changes in the world‚Äôs food production and consumption patterns must go hand in hand with sustainable
responses to several other equally critical challenges, such as reducing poverty, adapting to climate change and
supporting rural development. Science, technology and innovation alone cannot provide all the solutions, but
they must be key ingredients of the policy mix to achieve food security through sustainable, equitable agricultural
systems.
UNCTAD‚Äôs Technology and Innovation Report 2010 focuses on the technological challenges that small-holder
farmers in developing countries, especially sub-Saharan Africa, face in increasing agricultural productivity. It
outlines the agricultural sector‚Äôs challenges and the roles of technology and innovation in raising production and
the income of small-holder farmers. And it describes readily available technologies that can be applied now to
improve soils, manage water shortages and resist drought.
There is an urgent need to accelerate progress to meet growing demand and ensure synergy between food
security goals, environmental sustainability and social equity. I look to all partners to advance this agenda
through investment, research, technology transfer and stronger international cooperation. Together, we can help
farmers in developing countries to produce more food for the world‚Äôs growing population, reduce poverty and
support global efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2010

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Sub-Saharan Africa is the developing region most
likely to miss the Ô¨Årst Millennium Development Goal
(MDG1), aiming to reduce by half extreme hunger and
poverty by 2015. Per capita food production in least
developed countries (among which African countries
are over-represented) has declined continuously
since the early 1970s, so that in 2003-2005 it was
one-Ô¨Åfth lower than in 1970‚Äì1972. While Asia and
Latin America have seen signiÔ¨Åcant increases in their
agricultural productivity over the last three decades,
Africa‚Äôs agricultural productivity has stagnated. This
has created serious problems of food insecurity and
has presented a major development challenge given
that the agriculture sector forms the basis of many
African economies and provides the largest source
of employment and livelihoods for the vast majority
of the continent‚Äôs population. The core challenge that
confronts Africa is one of promoting steady growth
in agriculture in the dynamic context of economic
transformation of countries. Agriculture will remain
important for food security but at the same time,
building productive capacities in agriculture and
identifying multi-sectoral linkages between agriculture
and other sectors will be important to support
sustainable economic development of Africa. The
onus therefore lies in the identiÔ¨Åcation and support of
processes and linkages that promote technological
change, productivity increases and innovation.
This report focuses on the challenges of improving
agricultural performance in Africa and the role of
technology and innovation in raising agricultural
production and incomes of all farmers, including
smallholder farms. Much of the analysis is to some
degree applicable to farmers in developing countries
outside Africa. The report argues that the main
challenge that lies ahead is one of strengthening the
innovation capabilities of African agricultural systems
in order to be able to successfully address poverty,
improve food security and achieve broader economic
growth and development.
African policy-makers can make the changes
needed, provided there is sufÔ¨Åcient political will
and international support. Innovation, as opposed
to science and technology, refers to the interactive

process of application of knowledge in production
and building further upon it. Such knowledge might be
acquired through learning, research or experience, but
depends on the presence of technological capabilities
to be applied in the production of products across
sectors, including agriculture.
Technological innovation is not all composed of
radical discoveries, and much of what is relevant
to African agriculture relates to the ways in which
incremental improvements in processes, products,
inputs, or equipments are needed to adapt existing
technologies to the local environment in ways that
enhance productivity and lower costs. The ability to
adapt, therefore, is a signiÔ¨Åcant step in technological
empowerment, which over a period of time, can lead
to the creation of knowledge generation capabilities
amongst actors that are demand-driven rather than
simply those that aim to replicate the successes of
other regions of the world.
Declining agricultural productivity in many developing
countries can be reversed through building what are
called agricultural innovation systems that provide
the enabling framework not only for the adoption of
existing technologies and the development of new
ones that are suited for African needs. Agricultural
innovation systems denote the network of economic
and non-economic actors, and the linkages amongst
these actors enable technological, organizational and
social learning of the kind needed to devise contextspeciÔ¨Åc solutions. The dissemination of already
existing technologies from outside could help this
endeavour, but a major challenge relates to the ways
and means in which innovation that is relevant to
African agriculture could be promoted.
However, the ability of the agricultural innovation
system to be able to access, use and diffuse knowledge
embedded in agricultural technologies depends
on the presence of an enabling framework that
supports the emergence of technological capabilities
by strengthening existing linkages, promoting new
linkages and fostering inter-organisational learning
that leads to capital accumulation and technical
change. Such an enabling environment, by deÔ¨Ånition,
is one that strengthens the absorptive capacity of

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

local actors while protecting their interests through a
policy framework that recognises their legal rights and
privileges, linkages, socio-cultural norms and historical
context. This report deÔ¨Ånes an enabling environment
for technology and innovation in agriculture as
one that provides the actors, skills, institutions
and organizations required to promote the use,
dissemination, diffusion and creation of knowledge
into useful processes, products and services.
Creating an enabling environment for technology
and innovation is an essential requirement to enable
African countries to address the following constraints
that impede their agricultural development:
Declining investment: most developing countries
already had investment deÔ¨Åcits in agriculture well
before the onset of the current Ô¨Ånancial crisis in mid2008. The long decades of neglect of the agricultural
sector in the Africa region are partly a consequence of
the policy of strict Ô¨Åscal austerity imposed on African
countries, which has severely curtailed state support
of agriculture. The perception that investment has
merely to do with the provision of agriculture research
has exacerbated the situation further. This has resulted
in poor rural infrastructure, low coverage of extension
services, reduced provision of subsidies for inputs
and Ô¨Ånance for farmers, and reduced investment in
research and development in the agricultural sector.
As a result, farmers in Africa are now poorly equipped
to deal with the new challenges that they face, which
include climate change, desertiÔ¨Åcation, competition
from cheap imports, and highly concentrated global
value chains dominating the world‚Äôs commodity
markets. Investing in activities that promote new forms
of partnerships, use of local knowledge (including
traditional agricultural knowledge), practices and
preferences, as well as policy-driven demand-based
approaches have been missing to promote the
African response to its agricultural challenges.
Land tenure and credit access: access to credit
is another fundamental institutional constraint that
circumscribes the ability of African farmers to cope
with the rising prices of land, seeds and other
agricultural inputs. However, this clearly needs
to be accompanied by an enabling framework
that guarantees better physical and scientiÔ¨Åc
infrastructure of relevance to African agriculture, and
improved market access and demand forecasts.
Guaranteed land tenure could be vital to accessing

xiii

credit and investing in the medium and long-term
productivity of the land.
A focus on small-holder farmers: focussing on
smallholder farmers has proven an effective means
to contribute to a country‚Äôs economic growth
and food security. Smallholders make up over
half the population in most developing countries
and their farms are often efÔ¨Åciently run and enjoy
signiÔ¨Åcant growth potential. However, smallholder
farms are diverse in terms of the challenges and
limitations they face in the light of which adaptation
of technologies and reconÔ¨Åguration of supply
chain roles and responsibilities will be critical to
enable small-scale farmers to frame the issues
of appropriate agricultural outputs and activities
on their own terms. Their isolation makes them
susceptible to both external and internal shocks,
and also hinders resilient responses. A focus on
smallholder farms is required to ensure that they
are well networked into all available technical and
institutional support mechanisms that is so critical
for them to consolidate their activities.
Adapting to climate change: climate change
is a global challenge with critical development
implications. The negative impacts are especially
severe in marginal lands. Some 300 million
farmers in Africa live and work on marginal lands at
increased risk of soil degradation, droughts, Ô¨Çoods,
storms, pests and erratic rainfall. Climate change
technologies and innovations for mitigation and
adaptation strategies are needed to accelerate the
development, deployment, adoption, diffusion and
transfer of environmentally sound technologies from
developed to developing countries.
Bioenergy: energy is at the centre of the development
challenge in many developing countries, with
inadequate supply hindering capacities to expand
production and improve human wellbeing. If properly
managed, the high technical potential of bioenergy
in regions such as sub-Saharan Africa could make a
signiÔ¨Åcant contribution to Ô¨Åghting poverty while also
addressing climate change and expanding trade
opportunities in sustainable energy products.
Structural policy reforms: the thirty-year legacy
of structural adjustment and trade liberalization has
turned Africa from a net food-exporting continent to
one that predominantly imports. The food insecurity

xiv

situation in Africa is better framed in terms of
missed opportunities as a result of serious failings
of development strategies. Africa‚Äôs agricultural
sector implemented programmes designed to
eliminate price controls, privatize state farms and
state-owned enterprises, abate taxes on agricultural
exports, remove subsidies on fertilizer and other
inputs and encourage competition in agricultural
markets. The anticipation that these measures
would encourage the private sector to move in and
provide these services was not matched by reality.
Longstanding policy failures must be reversed.
Experience from the most recent crisis also shows
that countries that speciÔ¨Åcally aim to achieve food
security can cushion the blows from a cyclical world
market. Future trade agreements must ensure that
the space to apply such policies is preserved and,
indeed, strengthened.
Building locally relevant research and innovation priorities: African agricultural research has
not been weak, but it has lacked the right impetus to
bridge ongoing research with product development
initiatives. There has been a tendency to focus
on applying international models of agricultural
development without questioning their applicability
to local circumstances. An accompanying attitude
that looked down on regional research, as against
international research (where the latter was
considered to be far more superior), has been
entrenched since colonial times. In reality, patterns
of knowledge change are related to the increasing
convergence in the different areas of science and
technology, and indigenous capabilities of countries
matter. The beneÔ¨Åts attending to convergence
include new organizational production structures
and advances in communication apart from global
trade. This calls for policies that help re-orient actors
towards local sources of technology and learning,
and address the negative perception towards local
research.
It is important to realize that there are no quick Ô¨Åxes. This
can be seen in the case of other developing countries
which are now beneÔ¨Åting from public and private
investments that were made into the development of
agricultural technologies and innovation capacity since
decades. Brazil, for example, has achieved its current
leading position in tropical agriculture technology and
increased agricultural productivity as a result of more

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2010

than three decades of public and private investment in
the development of technological packages tailored
to its own soil and local agro-ecological conditions.
Amongst options available, international cooperation
can potentially be a strong factor in helping relevant
new technologies be adopted, adapted and diffused
throughout host economies. In particular, a handful of
South-South cooperation models have already proven
their worth as mechanisms for ensuring the right technological tools are made available to African farmers.
So-called triangular cooperation, where a Northern
neighbour signs on as a sponsor to South-South technology sharing efforts, has also shown promise as a
model for the international diffusion of technologies.
On this basis, when the new African Agriculture
Revolution is eventually implemented, it is likely to
be built on Africa‚Äôs own indigenous technology and
knowledge requirements, and the nutrition and food
security needs of its people. Building capabilities for
science, technology and innovation of relevance to
local agriculture however, is the only path to achieve
this.

THE REPORT
This Technology and Innovation Report 2010 looks at
how the current trend towards declining agricultural
productivity in many developing countries can be
reversed through building what are called agricultural
innovation systems, that provide the enabling
framework not only for the adoption of existing
technologies and the development of new ones
that are suited for African needs, but also focus
on improving agricultural infrastructure, services
and land management practices, new marketing
networks and partnerships, novel credit schemes
and a coherent institutional framework to support
agricultural development in the long run. The report
discusses current and future developments that are
likely to affect agricultural production and food supply,
and explores the role of technology and innovations
in the quest to achieve sustainable agriculture
production on one hand and facilitate access to food
for the poorest populations on the other.The Ô¨Årst
chapter outlines the critical issues in the development
of agriculture in Africa. Chapter 2 emphasizes the
crucial importance of building innovation capabilities
in African agriculture through investments into
‚Äòagricultural innovation systems‚Äô and the importance

xv

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

of an enabling environment to utilize technologies
and inventions. Chapter 3 discuss the key issues in
the development of agriculture in Africa including the
determinants of national food security, the options
available to improve domestic food production and
the role of agricultural trade in food security. Chapter
4 focuses on challenges and opportunities to achieve
national food security. It also examines the drivers
of a new Green Revolution while drawing lessons
from the Asian Green Revolution to suggest the
contours of the new agriculture paradigm for Africa

and Chapter 5 examines the transfer and farm-level
diffusion of agricultural technologies, including the
international transfer of technology through SouthSouth cooperation. Chapter 6 discusses the main
types of agricultural technologies and the importance
of choosing a mix of technologies suitable to the
diversity of local agro-ecological conditions found in
Africa. Finally, Chapter 7 sets out a number of policy
recommendations addressing the range of issues
covered in the preceding chapters.

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2010

CHALLENGES IN AFRICAN
AGRICULTURE

Over the last several decades, enough food has been
produced globally to feed everyone in the world.
Nonetheless, the number of undernourished people
in the world continues to rise, from 923 million in 2007
to over 1 billion in 2009, according to the FAO.1 The
food situation is critical in 33 countries that suffer
chronic shortfalls in aggregate food production, lack
of access to food or localized food insecurity.
The overwhelming majority of the world‚Äôs
undernourished people live in developing countries,
with some 65 per cent concentrated in just seven
countries: India, China, the Democratic Republic
of Congo, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan, and
Ethiopia. The highest proportion of undernourished
people is in sub-Saharan Africa, where one in three
people go chronically hungry. The causes, according
to the FAO, range from low agricultural productivity,
the current economic crisis, and adverse weather to
the HIV/AIDS pandemic, civil strife and war.
At Ô¨Årst sight, the fact that a billion people in the
world are undernourished while some regions are
producing enough food seems to call into question
the effectiveness of the distribution of global food
production, but Ô¨Ågures show that the global aspect
of the food crisis has been overstated. Most food is
consumed and produced locally and regionally. In
fact, 90 per cent of the world‚Äôs rice is produced and
consumed locally, as is 75 per cent of the world‚Äôs
wheat and maize.2 Rather than a ‚Äòglobal hunger
epidemic‚Äô, the world faces a proliferation of localized
instances of chronic food insecurity. This is the key
reason to focus on structural improvements to the
way food is produced at the local and regional level in
areas where food shortages are common, especially
in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia.
The situation in Africa is particularly worrying. Farmers
in Africa have lost 25 per cent of their purchasing
power in the last 25 years, and farm income levels are
now below $200 per person per year. Nonetheless, in
some areas productivity is improving, supported by
the low costs of land and labour and the rising prices
of farm products.3
Some semblance of hope for the future of African
agriculture is emerging, as evidenced by a number
of recent studies. In southern Uganda, for example,
farmers have turned to growing apples, displacing

imports and earning as much as $0.35 per apple
at the farm and an even higher price in the capital,
Kampala. In Zambia, cotton production has increased
ten-fold over the last ten years, bringing new income
to 120,000 farmers. In Kenya, Ô¨Çoral exports now
threaten to surpass coffee as the country‚Äôs leading
cash earner, while tens of thousands of Kenya‚Äôs smallholder farmers grow and export French beans and
other vegetables to Europe‚Äôs grocers. In Ethiopia, the
local coffee cooperatives have been able to respond
to international marketing demands while being able
to create a brand image that traces the product back
to its origin. Overall, exports of vegetables, fruits, and
Ô¨Çowers from eastern and southern Africa now exceed
$2 billion a year, up from virtually zero a quartercentury ago.4 Nevertheless, the volumes involved
in these cases are far from adequate, especially for
African countries struggling to meet their Millennium
Development Goals, particularly MDGs 1 and 7 (aiming
to end poverty and hunger and achieve environmental
sustainability).5
While demand for food continues to rise in conjunction
with demand for goods and services, the amount of
land available for food cultivation is decreasing due
to soil degradation and competition for other uses
such as housing, industrial development, roads,
and commercial production of cash crops such as
tobacco and coffee. Over the last 30 years, subSaharan cities grew at the astonishing rate of over Ô¨Åve
per cent per annum, while the growth in North Africa
was three per cent. It is anticipated that over the next
25 years, the key driver behind the evolution in the
African food markets will be urbanization.6 Achieving
food security in the face of these trends will require
breakthrough technologies, some of which have yet
to be developed.

1.2 ROLE OF TECHNOLOGY
AND INNOVATION
The predominant model of transfer of technology
model that served to guide public sector research
in agriculture in almost all developing countries in
the 1960s and 1970s was built on the faulty premise
that transfer of technology relates to linear Ô¨Çow of
information generated in the science institutions
that could be easily transferred to farmers for
application purposes.7 This ‚Äòlinear model for science
and technology‚Äô attenuated the focus on science
and research as removed from application (and

CHAPTER I : KEY ISSUES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF AGRICULTURE IN AFRICA

commercial innovation), and at the same time,
promoted the notion of technology as embodied in
spare parts and equipments. As a result, there was
a misplaced focus on ‚Äòscience suppliers‚Äô (production
of engineers and scientists) that were key to promote
research and transfer of technology (understood) as
equipments, blue prints and other codiÔ¨Åed sources of
information in order to promote local capacity.
The National Agricultural Research Systems (NARS)
framework that served as a basis to guide policy
actions on how research can contribute to agricultural
development for well over four decades was based on
this premise: that sharing agricultural research through
technology transfer, leads to technology adoption and
productivity growth.8 The Agriculture Knowledge and
Information Systems (AKIS) framework that emerged
as an alternative to explain the difÔ¨Åculties of the
NARS framework to agriculture development focused
predominantly on the importance of agriculture
extension services. The framework seeks to integrate
farmers with researchers, scientists, cooperatives
and extension services in order to generate the kinds
of knowledge that was crucial for their improved
performance. This framework, promoted by the Food
and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, is
based on the recognition that knowledge of relevance
to agricultural development has several sources and
linkages.
Three changes in the context of agricultural
development call attention to the need to examine
how innovation that underpins greater productivity
occurs in the agricultural sector:9 (i) markets, not
just production, increasingly drive agricultural
development; (ii) the underlying knowledge structure
for agriculture has changed remarkably, with the
private sector becoming a major player; (iii) agricultural
productivity and performance is increasingly related
to availability of updated, technologically-advanced
extension services which have undergone much
advances as a result of the exponential growth in
information and communications technology (ICT),
especially the Internet. These factors have changed
the face of agricultural development and rendered
it intricately linked to global economic trade and
knowledge capabilities of countries, but also focused
the associated emphasis on the inability of economic
growth to address the food security needs of the
poor clearer than ever before. Placing agriculture in
a knowledge-based innovation-driven context point
attention to the notion of science, technology and

3

innovation capacity building and what the prospects
might be for Africa‚Äôs own agriculture revolution.
Knowledge, as opposed to information, is the
basis of technological learning, and requires the
development of cognitive learning skills, linkages
and institutional support structures that promote
access, use, dissemination and applications based
on existing knowledge. The presence of absorptive
capacity locally therefore is a pre-requisite to build
capabilities through an interactive process for
technology and innovation in agriculture. Promoting
agricultural innovation requires new actors, processes
and technologies who would be the carriers of new
knowledge to replace the largely fragmented agrarian
knowledge system that form the basis of rural poverty.
The notion that peasant producers are ‚ÄòefÔ¨Åcient but
poor‚Äô10 is true in most of Africa thereby pointing to the
need to create conditions in which agriculture could be
made more efÔ¨Åcient based on productivity enhancing
technologies. Technological capability that focuses
on sustaining capacity in food producing areas is
critical to sustain the rate of yield growth needed to
achieve food security and expands on the resilience of
smallholder farms to both internal and external shocks
are. For example, farmers rely on research to control
weeds, pests and diseases and keep ahead of the
emergence of resistant strains. These technologies
form an integral part of improving the efÔ¨Åciency of
the production system. However, a range of factors
beyond technology affects the development of
productive capacities for agriculture in Africa. Human
resources are critical both to the development and
application of relevant technologies.
The presence of science infrastructure, stronger
linkages between various actors both for sharing
information and knowledge, improved physical
infrastructure that helps secure easier access to
markets, land security and protection of farmers‚Äô
rights are other factors that will determine the ability
of African agriculture to access relevant technologies.
However, the widespread adaptation, acceptance
and use of such productivity-enhancing technologies
will rely on the emergence of social and organisational
innovations that promote horizontal linkages amongst
actors. These could take the form of new dissemination
processes, efÔ¨Åcient extension services, emergence of
novel intermediary or incentive structures that promote
technical change, access to new forms of credit
schemes, among other changes to the institutional
context in which science, technology and innovation

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2010

Box 1: Addressing challenges in agricultural technology 13
A recent United Nations report on sustainable development highlighted the key challenges facing developing countries
seeking to achieve sustainable agricultural growth:
‚ÄúAgricultural technologies are vital to sustainable rural development, both to increase crop and livestock productivity and
to strengthen resilience of agricultural systems. Traditional emphasis on yield maximization has been tempered in recent
years by growing recognition of the need to ensure the long-run sustainability of yield improvements and to preserve vital
rural ecosystems and their functions. The recent food crisis and slow progress towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goal of eradicating hunger have highlighted the wide disparities in technologies used and productivity
achieved in different agricultural systems. While input and resource-intensive agriculture is the norm in many developed
and middle-income developing countries, many developing countries continue to rely on low-input, low-productivity agriculture. Even as the former group of countries need to shift towards less intensive and more environmentally sound methods, farmers in many developing countries would beneÔ¨Åt from greater input use. Yet, in principle, they should also beneÔ¨Åt
from the latest scientiÔ¨Åc knowledge and Ô¨Åeld testing of sustainable methods able to achieve high and stable yields and
resilience in the face of climate change.‚Äù

for agriculture occurs. All these factors jointly form
part of the enabling innovation environment that
will enhance the absorption capacity amongst local
Ô¨Årms and farms. ‚ÄòAbsorptive capacity‚Äô refers to the
ability of local producers to access, absorb, use and
diffuse relevant knowledge into enhancing productive
capacity. Finally, technological innovation must be
simultaneously supported by an enabling environment
that boosts the absorptive capacity of local producers
by, for instance, working with farmers to develop
the skills needed to implement new technological
breakthroughs that enable them to produce, store and
sell more food. Non-technological innovation is also
important in creating an environment that enables the
introduction of new products and new processes. Such
processes involve scaling-up investments to identify
and deploy technologies that increase productivity
and facilitate farmers‚Äô access to new techniques. All
these actions are technically and Ô¨Ånancially feasible,
and their adoption has been estimated to require
investment of $38 billion from 2009 to 2013, or $7.5
billion per year, in a well-designed package of modern
agricultural inputs and provisions.11 Upgrading the
enabling environment would also call for improving
and extending transport infrastructure, especially
major transport corridors and rural feeder roads.
Finally, it would require the lowering of trade barriers,
which remain much higher in agriculture than in other
sectors.12 Box 1 sets out some of the main issues and
challenges involved in developing appropriate and
sustainable agricultural technologies.
It must be borne in mind that, given the array of
challenges involved, it is unlikely that improvements
in agricultural technologies and the sector‚Äôs enabling
environment would be enough to provide reliable

livelihoods for the growing populations in many
developing countries. Alternative or additional income
generating opportunities are therefore needed to
support the millions of poor families who can no
longer rely solely on the land for their livelihoods.
Agro-processing has the potential to provide some
of these opportunities, as shown by poor countries in
other parts of the world such as Bangladesh.14

1.2.1 Renewed drive for investment
The steep decline of investment in agricultural research,
technology and infrastructure that has occurred all
over the world and mainly in sub Saharan Africa over
the last few decades has affected food security in two
distinct ways. First, it has resulted in production falling
short of the growing demand, with smaller stocks of
food surpluses available around the world.15 Second,
the decline in infrastructure investment has contributed
to high production and distribution costs that in turn
have kept food prices high and exacerbated the lack of
access to food, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. The
cost of transportation and distribution will be critical in
shaping strategies and policies for agriculture.
Reversing these trends will require a shift in focus:
what should developing countries invest into, in
order that agricultural innovation results? Besides the
different agro climatic conditions between Africa and
Asia, the success of the Green Revolution in much
of Asia and the lack of transformation of Africa‚Äôs
agriculture in spite of research efforts over the last few
decades is increasingly being explained in the context
of changing knowledge and capabilities of countries.
Agricultural development depends to a great extent
on how successfully knowledge is generated and

CHAPTER I : KEY ISSUES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF AGRICULTURE IN AFRICA

applied. Knowledge-based investments, especially
focusing on science and technology provision, have
played an emphatic role in devising strategies that aim
at promoting sustainable and equitable agricultural
development at the national level.16 Although many
of these investments have been quite successful,
the context for agriculture is changing rapidly and
the process of knowledge generation and use, and
agricultural innovation, has transformed as well.
Public sector research has played a central role
in agriculture globally in promoting the creation of
knowledge of relevance to commercial application.
In the developed countries, despite the general trend
of reduced public sector research for agriculture,
the research intensity in agriculture (deÔ¨Åned as the
percentage of total GDP generated through agriculture
that is invested into public sector research) is still 2.36
per cent, as compared to 0.53 per cent for developing
countries.17
Increased investments in science and technology
should be accompanied by extension services and
the identiÔ¨Åcation of strategic policies and investments
needed to transform agriculture and the food system
and stimulate broad-based economic growth. For
example, countries may opt to shift some domestic
food production and processing closer to consumers
in urban centres. Such a move would provide
investment opportunities in smallholder agricultural
businesses and the development of public-private
partnerships to address the productive side by tackling
supply-side constraints and deÔ¨Åciencies. However
numerous barriers would need to be overcome,
including typically poor infrastructure, very low density
of productive links with small- and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs), and little capacity in domestic
enterprises (processors, millers etc.) to supply valueadded goods or services either to the domestic or the
export markets.

1.3 KEY ISSUES
1.3.1 The global Ô¨Ånancial crisis
It is important to note that most developing countries
already had investment deÔ¨Åcits in agriculture and the
supporting infrastructure well before the onset of the
current Ô¨Ånancial crisis in mid-2008. With the advent of
the crisis, employment has declined in many areas,
lowering income and threatening many households‚Äô
access to food. The Ô¨Ånancial crisis has also impacted

5

government social services, trade, investment, aid,
remittances, and exchange rates, making imports
more expensive and, in many cases, food less
accessible.
Even more importantly, the global Ô¨Ånancial crisis has
overshadowed the food crisis, creating new difÔ¨Åculties
in mobilizing external resources to address the
increasing shortage of food in Africa. The Ô¨Ågures for
ofÔ¨Åcial development assistance (ODA) for agriculture
have also been steadily on the decline, falling from 13
per cent of total ODA in the early 1980s to 2.9 per cent
in 2005‚Äì2006, and could have further adverse impacts
on building science, technology and innovation
capacity as governments turn their attentions to other
short-term goals.18

1.3.2 Land tenure and credit access
One of the main barriers hindering smallholders‚Äô
access to agricultural credit in developing countries
is the inability to convert property into usable assets,
due to the lack of clear-cut, legally recognized and
transferable land tenure rights. There are millions of
dollars trapped in ‚Äòdead property‚Äô around the world
due to the fact that owners do not have ofÔ¨Åcial title to
their land. Over 80 per cent of the land occupied by the
poor in developing countries is not legally recognised
tenure. This restricts their ability to not only to access
credit, but also to integrate land management
practices that could help increase the productivity
of the land due to the absence of well-deÔ¨Åned and
enforceable property rights. Thus, awarding title to
land is an important way to Ô¨Åght poverty at its most
basic level.19

1.3.3 The food crisis
From an African perspective, the food crisis can be
seen as the result of two overlapping crises: a supply
crisis (caused by low productivity) and the hike in food
prices as a result of the commodity crisis as a result of
speculation, as illustrated in Figure 1.20
The debate on the price volatility of agricultural
commodities has for a long time taken place in the
context of agricultural trade liberalization. However
several aspects of domestic food price volatility are
also rooted in the low productivity of smallholder
agriculture and the difÔ¨Åculties farmers face in
marketing their products given their scant market
information and their limited capacity to contain postharvest losses. Price volatility, in addition to the already

6

existing constraints, has implications for the ability of
agricultural producers to undertake investments. At the
same time, the uncertainty that price volatility breeds
makes consumers wary and less willing to spend.
Price volatility is therefore an important disincentive to
long-term investment in agriculture.21
The global food crisis should serve as a wake-up call
for the international community to revitalize agricultural
systems of production and innovation, and trade,
in order to rectify systemic imbalances. Developing
countries must use the latent potential for the growth
of productive capacities thus breaking away from
decades of policy bias against agriculture.
Developing countries have had mixed results in
dealing with the food crisis and reducing the impact
of soaring food prices on consumers and producers.
Innovative short-term solutions that deal with reducing
the threat of food prices on food security have been
tested in some countries such as Indonesia, where
the government intervened in the market to stabilize
prices, including managing available stock and, in
certain cases, limiting exports. A different approach
was adopted by the governments of Mexico and
Jordan, which pursued price negotiations with
agro-industries, leading to agreements not to pass
increases in production costs on to the consumer.22
These experiences are relevant to African countries
simultaneously burdened with the urgent task of
improving productive capacity for agriculture and
ensuring greater availability of food at reasonable
prices for all.
UNCTAD has suggested that in order to overcome
the ‚Äòcommodity trap‚Äô that African countries are faced
with as a result of their increasing reliance on trade
in commodities, there is a need for mechanisms that
help Africa achieve a structural transformation to
productivity enhancing technologies in the medium
or long-term.23 This transformation needs to be
augmented by a compensatory Ô¨Ånancial mechanism
for African producers to meet short-term price shocks
and declining incomes, as well as a ‚ÄòdiversiÔ¨Åcation
fund‚Äô that supports the rise of new products and
services in African economies.

1.3.4 Focusing on smallholder farmers
Smallholders make up over half the population in
most developing countries and small farms are often
efÔ¨Åciently run and enjoy signiÔ¨Åcant growth potential.
Stagnant agricultural productivity in Africa has worsened

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2010

the situation of the continent‚Äôs farmers who are Ô¨Ånding it
increasingly difÔ¨Åcult to cope with the new and mounting
pressures of climate change, input costs and drought.
These are the kinds of issues that an African agriculture
revolution must address.25 There is evidence from
countries such as Vietnam, which has gone from being
a food-deÔ¨Åcit country to the second-largest rice exporter
in the world, that points out that a focus on smallholder
farmers can contribute to a country‚Äôs economic
growth and food security.26 A fundamental issue is
that smallholder farmers are not necessarily deprived
due to their size, but rather due to their isolation from
the knowledge and information systems. Their isolation
makes them susceptible to both external and internal
shocks, and also hinders resilient responses. A focus on
smallholder farms is required to ensure that they are well
networked into all available technical and institutional
support mechanisms that is so critical for them to
consolidate their activities
To enable a number of fundamental production related
conditions for smallholder farmers to manage risks and
uncertainty and become effective players in the market,
it is necessary to improve:
‚Ä¢ access to agro-inputs;
‚Ä¢ adequate storage capacity;
‚Ä¢ access to up-to-date market information and
extension services;
‚Ä¢ access to formal markets;
‚Ä¢ access to clustering and cooperative forms of
organisations; and
‚Ä¢ access to credit.
Focusing strategies thus to enhance food security on
smallholder farmers would imply a strategic shift towards
working primarily with them in analysing the root causes
of hunger and overcoming risk and vulnerability. Several
recent initiatives have begun to introduce such activities
in a successful way.
For example, a range of innovative procurement and
programme practices is now used by the World Food
Programme (WFP) to reduce the risks faced by smallscale farmers. These include forward contracting
and warehouse receipt programmes that can serve
as collateral for loans, and supporting value-added
production and local food processing. Other options
include improving tendering systems so that small-scale
farmers are in a better position to compete for locally
issued contracts, supporting producers‚Äô access to
market information systems, and improving regulatory
structures to govern quality standards and address the
problem of speculation in commodity markets.

1.3.5 Adapting to man-made change
Urbanization, land degradation, population pressure
and climate change are global challenges with critical
development implications. Populations in developing
countries are more vulnerable to, and will be more
adversely affected by, climate change. The negative
impacts especially in marginal lands include soil
degradation and increased risk of droughts, Ô¨Çoods,
storms and pests. Three hundred million farmers in
Africa live and work on marginal lands.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has
found that ‚Äúagricultural production and food security
(including access to food) in many African countries
and regions are likely to be severely affected by climate
change and climate variability.‚Äù27
In low-latitude regions, where most developing
countries are found, even moderate temperature
increases are likely to result in declining yields for the
major cereals. Growing aridity is expected to affect
agricultural productivity directly in some regions, such
as southern Africa and some parts of Asia and Latin
America. On the other hand, in temperate regions
and tropical highlands, production may increase
due to warmer weather. In the East African highlands
for example, higher temperatures may result in land
becoming unsuitable for wheat but more suitable for
other grains.28
A consequence of these expected changes in
production potential (increasing in mid- to highlatitude areas and decreasing in low-latitude areas)
will be a shift in global trade patterns. Generally,
production and trade Ô¨Çows of high-latitude and midlatitude products are expected to increase, with
products such as cereals and livestock products being
exported towards low-latitude regions. However, the
exact nature of these shifts remains unclear, and more
research is needed before policy-makers can properly
understand the likely implications.

1.3.6 Bioenergy and sustainability in
agriculture
Energy is at the centre of the development challenge
in many developing countries, with inadequate energy
supply hindering capacities to expand production and
improve human wellbeing. In the context of global
efforts to address climate change and its impacts on
agriculture, many developing countries are credited
with signiÔ¨Åcant potential to produce agriculture-based

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2010

energy sources. Several studies have shown that,
if properly managed, the high technical potential of
bioenergy in regions such as sub-Saharan Africa could
make a signiÔ¨Åcant contribution to Ô¨Åghting poverty
while also addressing climate change and expanding
trade opportunities in sustainable energy products.
This would seem to make bioenergy development
a particularly beneÔ¨Åcial strategy for oil importing
developing countries.
However, such a strategy would need to be carefully
designed and managed as the large-scale production
of biofuels poses a number of signiÔ¨Åcant challenges.
First, it is important to fully analyse all aspects of
bioenergy technology, in particular, the crop type. A
comparison of arable land requirements for a given
amount of energy production shows that soybeans
require almost 12 times as much arable land as sugar
cane, while corn requires twice as much land as sugar
cane.29 This means that to replace 25 per cent of the
transportation energy from fossil fuels with energy from
liquid biofuels would require 430 million hectares for
sugar cane ‚Äì 17 per cent of the world‚Äôs arable land30 ‚Äì
and 5 billion hectares for soybean ‚Äì 200 per cent of the
world‚Äôs arable land. The competition with food crops
on land and resources (e.g. water) is clear. Biofuels
therefore should be viewed as one potential source of
energy to be used in combination with others.

1.3.7 Structural policy reforms
In the 1970s, many African countries like Malawi, Kenya,
Zambia and Zimbabwe were net exporters of agricultural
products and farmers in these countries were recipients
of government support. This trend changed drastically in
the 1980s when the debate on food security in Africa was
marked by two major trends. One was growing concern
on how to continue ‚Äòfeeding the cities‚Äô (which shifted
the policy emphasis to sustaining and providing the
growth of cities in Africa, thereby neglecting agricultural
development) and the other concerned Structural
Adjustment Policies (SAPs).31
The food insecurity situation in Africa today points to a
serious failing of development strategies at both the
national and international levels. Addressing the UNCTAD
Trade and Development Board in 2009, AGRA‚Äôs Vice
President for Policy and Partnerships Mr. Adesina asserted
that the problems facing smallholder farmers in Africa
today are ‚Äúa result of missed opportunities and decisions
made by governments and international institutions rather
than a result of stubborn facts‚Äù.32

CHAPTER I : KEY ISSUES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF AGRICULTURE IN AFRICA

Africa‚Äôs agricultural sector has implemented programmes
designed to eliminate price controls, privatize state
farms and state-owned enterprises, abate taxes on
agricultural exports, remove subsidies on fertilizer and
other inputs and encourage competition in agricultural
markets. The effectiveness of these programmes is
disputed.33 For their proponents, such reforms have
improved market efÔ¨Åciency, reduced budget deÔ¨Åcits,
stimulated export production, and increased the share
of the Ô¨Ånal price received by farmers. Opponents point
to the destabilization of agricultural prices, the widening
of the income distribution gap, and reductions in access
to low-cost inputs.34
The agricultural sector continues to face structural
and institutional constraints in most African countries,
including issues of ownership, access and security of
tenure of land, access to credit, the marketing system
and the Ô¨Çuctuation of prices, as well as low farm gate
prices. The longstanding policy failures leading to such
problems in the agricultural sector must be reversed.

1.3.8 Liberalization, agricultural trade
and global markets
African agricultural systems are still recovering from
liberal reforms of the 1980s that resulted in declining
investments in public agricultural research and
dismantling of marketing boards and reduced the
support to extension services. While global markets
and the potential for integration therein will be vital,
there are several factors that may not make this an
easy transition for African countries. Studies on other
developing countries show that the impact of opening
up agriculture and removing farming subsidies is most
likely to be on crop prices, and not on crop outputs.35
This is because structural rigidities in agricultural
systems tend to stunt the short and mid-term supply
response. In the light of the fact that the demand for
food remains constant, despite the pressures imposed
on the agricultural system to cope with liberalization
and removal of subsidies, a short term price increase
in food grains is to be anticipated.36

1.4 DEVELOPING AND
DISSEMINATING RELEVANT
TECHNOLOGY
Transfer of technology can occur at several levels.
Primarily, the transfer of tacit know-how and skills
between people internationally, regionally, nationally

9

or between organisations is recognised to be the most
basic and effective form of dissemination of technology
and skills. A second important source of technology is
the result of the increased specialization in the trade in
components and Ô¨Ånished products which are causing
a shift in production to locations that offer economies
of scale as part of global value chains in all sectors,
including agriculture.37 Firms and farms that are part
of such production networks beneÔ¨Åt from the linkages
with buyers and other competitors in the market,
wherein not only machinery and equipments are
transferred, but also marketing skills, management
standards and quality protocols and production
systems are shared.38 However, these two forms of
technology transfer require the steady movement or
exchange of researchers from international or regional
organisations to national organisation within Africa
and the integration of local production to global value
chains.
These channels can be strengthened through
South-South cooperation policies for agricultural
development and trade. South-South cooperation
offers an important catalyst for addressing the issues
of productivity at bilateral, regional and interregional
levels among developing countries and in building
food security. Such cooperation can include exchange
of best practices, technologies and technicians on
agricultural production. It can be undertaken within the
framework of sub-regional or regional organizations
of developing countries through dedicated agriculture
and food sector development programmes and trade
programmes. South-South cooperation offers an ideal
avenue through which constructive discussions could
take place between food surplus countries and food
deÔ¨Åcit countries on meeting the food needs of the
latter without undermining those of the former.39
A third form of technology transfer is marketdriven, where potential technology seekers (Ô¨Årms or
individuals) from developing countries seek partners
in the technologically advanced countries to acquire
relevant technologies. The motives for the users
to seek these technologies mainly stem from the
expectation of beneÔ¨Åts such as reduced costs and
increased output (see the case of Zambia in chapter
2). Such market-driven technology transfer is largely
dependent on the ability of the technology seeker to
pay the market price of the technology (which may or
may not include tacit know-how transfer). In addition
to purchasing ability, a range of other factors impede
the ability of the technology seeker, such as lack of

10

bargaining power, increased search costs in Ô¨Ånding the
right partners and most importantly a lack of quid pro
quo in the technology licensing/ technology sharing
contracts.40 A large number of such technology
transfer efforts do not materialize since the size of the
market and the ability of the technology seeker to pay
for the technology does not meet the expectations of
the technology holder. This is especially true in small
markets or markets where the majority of the potential
technology users are poor and have no ability to pay,
such as the agriculture sector in Africa. ChieÔ¨Çy as a
result of this, public-not-for-proÔ¨Åt entities have been
actively engaged in promoting the dissemination of
technologies in the agricultural sector in recent times.
ScientiÔ¨Åc and technology partnerships are thus
increasingly vital for African countries seeking to
address issues of food security. To a certain extent,
the ability to sustain large-scale in-house R&D efforts
that conferred clear advantages upon larger countries
and Ô¨Årms in the past in the agricultural sector can also
be matched by the Ô¨Çexibility and size of the network
to which smaller producers belong. Such networks
and partnerships provide critical support to innovative
activity at the technological frontier.41

1.5 THE IMPERATIVE OF
DEMAND-LED APPROACHES
TO AGRICULTURAL
DEVELOPMENT
Despite concerted efforts by different international
and national organizations to promote food security
and reduce poverty by way of stimulated trade
efforts and introduction of improved crop and animal
breeding varieties, Africa remains food insecure
and farming communities generally remain poorer
than those engaged in manufacturing and services.
Some exceptions do exist, as demonstrated by the
experience of the horticulture industry in East and
southern Africa and cassava in Zambia (see case
studies in chapter 2). In these cases, partnerships and
intra-Ô¨Årm trade have played a central role in helping
African producers to offer value-added within global
value chains. Value chains denote inter-connected
activities offered by Ô¨Årms, cooperatives or individual
entrepreneurs towards creating, developing and
producing a particular product or services at different
nodes of the production chain. Integrating smallholder farmers into global value chains can help to
signiÔ¨Åcantly upgrade their activities by enabling them

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2010

to access product design/ delivery information and
also prescribing quality standards that need to be
adhered to. They provide small-holder farmers the
relevant access to the services provided by a network
of information, credit and service providers, suppliers,
buyers and processing companies.
Contract farming provides yet another way to raise
small-farm income by delivering technology and
market information to small-holder farmers and
incorporating them into remunerative new markets.
Critics of contract farming see it as a means by which
agribusiness Ô¨Årms take advantage of the unequal
bargaining relationship to pass production risk to
farmers. However, well managed contract farming
has proven effective in linking the small farm sector to
sources of extension advice, mechanization, seeds,
fertilizer and credit, and to guaranteed and proÔ¨Åtable
markets for produce. Another model is to stimulate
demand and improve productivity through targeted
support such as in the case of cotton where training,
credit, market development and agriculture inputs are
made available.
Despite such advantages, supply-led approaches
such as global value chain promote products that have
a regional/global market and are not a mechanism
through which the prevailing local demand for
speciÔ¨Åc agricultural products can be reÔ¨Çected. Strong
productivity and (real) income growth which is key
for industrialization of countries,42 however, derives
mainly from the ability to achieve scale economies in
production, specialization and technological learning
on the supply side; and on the demand side, the ability
to respond to demand.43
The real challenge that remains is one of matching
supply led approaches by demand-led ones. There
have been several models in recent times, including
the community-driven development (CDD) approach
of the World Bank, where the focus is on empowering
communities to take charge of their development
processes and options.44 Other approaches seek
to enhance farmers‚Äô ability to upgrade and compete
such as out-grower schemes in Ô¨Çower and vegetable
production systems. These schemes present new
ways of bringing together producers and agribusiness
and they establish and enforce grades, standards
and regulations, improve the investment climate
and provide essential public goods such as rural
infrastructure. The schemes have the potential to
support equitable and sustainable development as
they recognize the market, socioeconomic, cultural

CHAPTER I : KEY ISSUES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF AGRICULTURE IN AFRICA

and management aspects of rural farming and link
these to public policy and good institutional settings
aimed at sustainable and proÔ¨Åtable agriculture.
This report suggests the innovation systems approach
as a potential means to view agricultural systems.
Although there are several common sets of actors in
value chains and innovation systems, value chains
emerge and respond to market needs (global, largely)
whereas innovation systems tend to be local demand
driven.

1.6 RETHINKING AFRICAN
AGRICULTURE FROM AN
INNOVATION PERSPECTIVE
Comparative advantage in agricultural resources by
itself is a static condition that can no longer form the basis
for competitiveness. Such initial local advantages need
to be supported through technological improvements
that render production competitive. The notion that
divides sectors into ‚Äúhi-tech‚Äù and ‚Äúlow-tech‚Äù based
strictly on R&D-intensity is misleading viewed against
the progressive intensiÔ¨Åcation of knowledge across
all sectors. This suggests clearly the need to move
beyond the linear conceptualization of technological
progress as doing R&D to a more systemic notion that
includes other actors to factor in these realities.
An innovation system is a network of actors, both
market and non-market oriented, collaboration and
linkages amongst whom is the basis for learning and
commercialization of products cater to local demand.
Such ‚Äúsystems of innovation‚Äù involves purposive
actions of governments in the deliberate creation of
organizations and incentive mechanisms to foster the
creation, transfer, adoption, adaptation, and diffusion of
knowledge. These non-market avenues are necessary
(contrary to the pure market view) because the market
alone is a poor Ô¨Ålter for technical change, which is
the locus of production and innovation. All the other
non-market coordination mechanisms are particularly
important, but they are notably weak and suffer from
poor systemic coordination in developing countries.
Prominent among these are what this report classiÔ¨Åes
as the enabling environment for innovation, and
includes the structures of research and development
(R&D), Ô¨Ånance support, metrology, standards and
quality centres, and, at the base of it all, the system
of education, which is responsible for new knowledge
from basic research and the training of scientists and
engineers.

11

Declining agricultural productivity in many developing
countries can be reversed through building what are
called agricultural innovation systems that provide
the enabling framework not only for the adoption of
existing technologies and the development of new
ones that are suited for African needs. Agricultural
innovation systems denote the network of economic
and non-economic actors, and the linkages amongst
these actors enable technological, organizational
and social learning of the kind needed to devise
context-speciÔ¨Åc solutions. The linkages are both
vertical (supply chains, organisational support, Ô¨Årm
structures) and horizontal (extension services, market
access infrastructure). The dissemination of already
existing technologies from outside could help this
endeavour, but a major challenge relates to the ways
and means in which innovation that is relevant to
African agriculture could be promoted.
However, the ability of the agricultural innovation
system to be able to access, use and diffuse
knowledge embedded in such technologies depends
on the presence of an enabling framework that
supports the emergence of technological capabilities
by strengthening existing linkages, promoting new
linkages and fostering inter-organisational learning
that leads to capital accumulation and technical
change. Such an enabling environment, by deÔ¨Ånition,
is one that strengthens the absorptive capacity of
local actors while protecting their interests through
a policy framework that recognises their legal rights
and privileges, linkages, socio-cultural norms and
historical context. This report deÔ¨Ånes an enabling
environment for technology and innovation in
agriculture as one that provides the actors, skills,
institutions and organizations required to promote
the use, dissemination, diffusion and creation of
knowledge into useful processes, products and
services.
The objective of innovation policies is primarily to
encourage linkages between the different actors of
the innovation system. This requires an integrative
and holistic approach to policy formulation and
demands close interaction between the different
ministries whose policies have an impact on
innovation and performance of the economy as
a whole (national innovation system) or speciÔ¨Åc
sectors (ICT, agriculture, health, electronics, etc).
In addition to the misconception that innovation
is just for the more advanced countries and the
limited understanding of what innovation means in a

12

developing context, the huge scope for formulating
an innovation policy ideally designed for developing
countries undoubtedly constitutes a major challenge
in Africa.
Viewing agriculture through an innovation lens is
becoming more prevalent in policy circles in recent
times. For example, the Framework for African
Agricultural Productivity (FAAP), developed by the
Forum for Agricultural Research in Africa (FARA)
and its partners, also advocates putting farmers
at the centre of agricultural innovation systems by
empowering them to be active players in improving
agricultural productivity, not just in terms of
increasing their yields, but also in decision-making
on how programmes and policies are shaped. The
existing national agricultural research systems in
sub-Saharan Africa require more efforts towards
training, education and revamping the extension
services. FARA recognizes that the role of extension
systems must shift from prescribing to facilitating.
Moving towards more participatory agricultural
extension will allow greater responsiveness to
farmers‚Äô needs and facilitate learning on how they
can increase their own productivity, raise their
incomes, collaborate effectively with one another
(and with partners in agri-business and agricultural
research), and become actively involved with
major stakeholders in determining the process
and directions of innovation, including technology
generation and adoption.45
We argue in this report that developing strong
capabilities in science, technology and innovation
are key elements that are needed for agricultural
Ô¨Årms and farms just as it applies for manufacturing
and industrial Ô¨Årms. The capacity to innovate
- deÔ¨Åned as the ability to introduce products,
processes or organizational methods in design,
production, marketing and distribution that are new
to the local context although not to the rest of the
world - is becoming increasingly important as global
competition increases in markets for manufactured
goods, services and even primary produce. This is
especially so for production geared towards export
markets, but may apply even to production geared
towards domestic consumption in developing
countries given widespread import liberalization
and the gradual lowering of tariff rates. The need for
improved innovation capabilities will likely rise further
in light of variations in climactic conditions as well
as continued intense competition, the proliferation

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2010

of standards in food production and processing
and fast changing consumer preferences in food
markets, even in developing countries. Improved
STI capabilities will also continue to be needed
if higher value addition in agriculture and food
systems through local processing of agricultural
produce into food products that command higher
prices and provide higher incomes - which many
developing countries are striving to achieve - are
to be realized.

1.7

AGRICULTURE AND
ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION
OF AFRICA

Three key issues confront African agriculture
today. First, there is a need to enhance productive
capacities that could in turn increase yield and
reduce the environmental and other impacts of
agricultural expansion. Second, there is a drastic
and immediate need to raise the living standards
of people working in agriculture. Over two thirds
of the African continent is presently dependent
on agriculture for livelihood and characterized by
extremely limited access to health, nutrition and
decent environmental standards. Over 70 per cent
of child labour worldwide is found in agriculture.
This calls for immediate and urgent action to
improve the living standards of the people engaged
in agriculture.46 Finally, there is a need to lessen
the demographic burden on agriculture in Africa
by creating an institutional basis for diversiÔ¨Åcation
of economic activities into other sectors. This will
not only be important for agriculture but also for
the overall sustainable development for African
countries.
The vicious cycle of poverty equally forecloses the
imperative of investment in what is most urgent, the
need to commit resources to building innovation
capacity: investing in scientiÔ¨Åc and engineering
manpower, building laboratory and industrial facilities
to focus on urgent local food and disease problems.
In other words, we need to address urgently the
challenges of institutions, infrastructure and human
resources that lead to exclusion and deprivation and
secondly to break the cycle of lack of access to credit
in poor African countries.
A well-focused long-term growth strategy for Africa
is one that employs the twin strategy of investing in
dynamically growing sectors, while at the same time,

CHAPTER I : KEY ISSUES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF AGRICULTURE IN AFRICA

enhancing the productive capacity of the agricultural
sector, where most of its labour is presently
employed.47 Agricultural systems, which employ
the largest, poorest and most uneducated labour
force, need to be Ô¨Årmly linked with the dynamically
growing sectors of the economy. As UNCTAD (2006)
has identiÔ¨Åed, the most effective approach clearly
will be one that promotes simultaneous investments
in agriculture, industry and services, and promotes
exports that primarily focus on the local valueadded.
A systems of innovation perspective for African
agriculture shows us the intricate and complex
linkages between agriculture, nutrition, health and
other dynamic sectors of the economy. For this
reason, income, per capita yield of crops output and
capacity improvements that promote crops that the
majority of small-holder farmers produce will be key
to solving the poverty problem.

13

1.8 SIGNS OF SUCCESS
Despite the challenges faced, there are several
success stories of African agriculture that serve as
benchmarks going forward.48 These include:
‚Ä¢ Several new technologies-based developments,
such as biological control of the cassava mealy
bug and tissue culture applications of banana,
pineapple and other agricultural products
‚Ä¢ Agriculture based production systems ‚Äì such
as pineapple cultivation in Ghana and the cutÔ¨Çower cut Ô¨Çower sectors in Kenya, Ethiopia and
the United Republic of Tanzania‚Äì have been
successfully developed,
‚Ä¢ African agricultural producers have made their
presence felt in several important global value
chains such as coffee suppliers from Ethiopia
and Mozambique,

2.1 INTRODUCTION
This chapter attempts to apply innovation systems
framework to African agriculture as a potentially useful
tool for identifying weaknesses in the agricultural
production and innovation system of a country. Such
a ‚Äògap analysis‚Äô is a necessary step in developing
policy actions to support agricultural development,
both for the short term and the long term. The
components of an agricultural innovation system (as
illustrated in Figure 14) include the actors, institutions,
organizations and policies that together support
innovation in agriculture, along with the infrastructure
and Ô¨Ånancing mechanisms that enable it. The
characteristics of these innovation systems may vary
signiÔ¨Åcantly between (and even within) countries,
which make country-speciÔ¨Åc analysis necessary, but
there remain some common issues that affect many
African countries to a greater or lesser extent.
A number of features differentiate an innovation
system from both the traditional production oriented,
equilibrium-based models of the economic system and
from the narrower focus on science and technology
systems that were an earlier effort at dealing with
the role of technological change in economic
development. An innovation system is conceptualized
as a network of Ô¨Årms and other economic agents
who, together with the institutions and policies that
inÔ¨Çuence their innovative behaviour and performance,
bring new products, new processes and new forms
of organization into economic use49 The focus is on
interaction between these actors and the institutional
and policy context that inÔ¨Çuences their innovative
behaviour and performance.
The scope of potentially important economic actors
in an innovation system also differs from the set of
suppliers and clients arrayed along the classic value
chains and incorporated into input-output models
or from the set of organizations-- universities, public
sector research bodies, science councils-- that
are the traditional focus of science and technology
studies. There is no assumption, moreover, that an
innovation process is linear or that knowledge outputs
feed directly or automatically into products for sale in
the market. Instead, the knowledge and information
Ô¨Çows that are at the core of an innovation system are
multidirectional in nature and open opportunities for
the development of feedback loops that can enhance
competence building, learning and adaptation.

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2010

The innovation system approach factors in the
demand-side of innovations, thus centring attention
on local demand for particular products/ processes,
such as those for particular crops, medicines or
essential goods that form part of development
concerns. Demand Ô¨Çows are amongst the signals that
shape the focus of research, the decision as to which
technologies from among the range of the possible
will be developed and the speed of diffusion of these
technologies. Demand is not solely articulated through
the market, but may take place through a variety of
non-market mediated collaborative relationships
between individual users and producers of products
and services. In still broader terms demand can be
intermediated by policies. Enhancing knowledge
and information Ô¨Çows is yet another way to stimulate
innovation and facilitate adaptive policymaking.
In applying the sectoral innovation system framework
to agriculture, this chapter shows how policy makers
could build a supportive enabling environment
for agriculture, especially for smallholder farmers.
Appropriate policy actions to enable such an
environment will be important to promote the
development of the agricultural sector to respond to
both internal and external stimuli.

2.2 INNOVATION SYSTEMS AS A
POLICY TOOL
Across sectors and time, different conÔ¨Ågurations of
critical actors will emerge from among the multitude
of organizations -- industry associations, R&D and
productivity centres, universities, vocational training
institutes, information gathering and analysis services,
engineering services, banking and other Ô¨Ånancial
mechanisms, standard setting bodies -- whose
relationship to the innovation process within a sector
or system-wide level might prove critical. Yet today, we
have little information about the range of actors that
currently exist in the local/national or sector context,
their competences, habits and practices of learning
and interacting or the propensity to innovate. How
different social norms, practices and other institutions
affect the processes of learning and innovation in
a given national or regional context is also poorly
understood. Policies are rarely monitored or evaluated
thus limiting our ability to assess the way in which
current policies affect the parameters within which
the decisions of local actors with regard to learning,
linkages and investments take place.50

CHAPTER II: BUILDING INNOVATION CAPABILITIES IN AFRICAN AGRICULTURE

Whether tacit or explicit, policies play a role in setting the
parameters within which actors make decisions about
learning, investment and innovation for all sectors in an
economy. The innovation systems approach recognizes
that policy dynamics supportive of an innovation process
are not the outcome of a single policy but a set of policies
that collectively shape the behaviour of actors. The need
for an overall innovation strategy, for priority setting and
for policy coordination is thus critical in strengthening
innovation systems whether at the national, local or sector
levels. From a policy perspective, the innovation system
approach has a number of important strengths. Policy
dynamics, moreover, are generated by the interaction of
policies with the behavioural norms and attitudes of actors
that they seek to condition. Learning and unlearning on
the part of all actors including policymakers are thus
essential to the evolution of an innovation system in
response to new challenges.
Monitoring the policy dynamics generated by the
interaction between policies and actors in the system
and opening channels for dialogue, for example, would
be of importance in Ô¨Åne-tuning policies for maximum
impact and responsiveness to changing technological
and competitive conditions. Policies thus have an
important role to play in reinforcing older norms and rules
or in stimulating and supporting change. Its dynamic
strengths are also evident in the stimulus it provides for
a re-conceptualization of sectors as potential ‚Äòinnovation
systems‚Äô. The framework derives from the experiences of
other countries, mostly industrialized and more recently
some developing countries, in severeral traditional and
modern sectors, including agriculture.
Most importantly, the framework recognises that the
capacity to innovate will involve a system of diverse
organisations or actors, notably the private sector but also
others outside of the State, whose actions are shaped by
a variety of institutional, policy, market and technological
signals. The framework is therefore particularly suited to
exploring sectors where the private sector and other nongovernmental actors are playing leading roles and where
Ô¨Årms, sectors and countries have to cope with shocks
and deal with competitive pressures.

2.2.1 Characterizing an agricultural
innovation system
An agricultural innovation system (AIS) can be
fundamentally characterized as the set of actors, the
collaborative linkages between whom are critical for
the development of products/ processes or services

17

that are new to the local context where they are
introduced. These linkages are primarily fostered
through policies and institutions (that refer to the rules
of the game, as set by laws and regulations or simply
cultural and social attitudes) that promote access,
diffusion, use, adaptation and creation of new forms of
knowledge in agricultural production through learning
mechanisms of various sorts. R&D and science
conducted within centres of excellence and premier
institutions within the country and outside, is one such
form of knowledge, but not the only one.
From the standpoint of this deÔ¨Ånition, one is forced to
ask the obvious question: do agricultural innovation
systems exist at all in African countries where private
sector is largely absent, governmental R&D spending
is marginal and technological capacity is not well
advanced? If we were to assume so, what are the
points of departure of African agricultural systems of
innovation?
Three major factors stand out while analysing
agricultural innovation in Africa. First, the private
sector is conspicuous largely by its absence, rather
than for its proven ability for product development as
is the case in the industrialized countries. The systems
of innovation at the sectoral level are quite often so
stymied by the absence of private enterprise that most
research results from the public sector do not Ô¨Ånd
their way to the market.51 The point to take home here
is two fold: the knowledge base is more dispersed
than what we know from our experiences of studying
agricultural innovation systems from industrialized and
other developing countries, and the organisations that
play the critical role in applying existing knowledge or
generating new knowledge through learning activities
are in the public sector.
Second, the market for agricultural products is
severely fragmented in African countries and this
stunts advance that require demand and supply
side coordination. In other words, local demand
never gets codiÔ¨Åed into local research or innovation
agendas due to information asymmetries within userproducer networks52 as a result of which directed and
targeted investment into R&D capacity (even in the
public sector) does not materialize. Markets in African
countries not only have relatively small size (thrive on
personal exchanges of kinship relations, personal
loyalty and social connections) but also Ô¨Åt in many
respects with types of markets that are characterized
by low proÔ¨Åtability, limited economies of scale and low
intensity learning that slows long run technological

18

capability building. These shortcomings of markets
needs to be addressed by policy, because in addition
to articulating demand, markets are important for
transfer of technologies in agriculture, especially
those related to biotechnology and other advanced
technological applications through arms-length
transactions.53
Finally and perhaps most importantly, technological
advances in agriculture of relevance to Africa has not
progressed in an adequately coordinated manner and
is largely at its infancy. Historical constraints that have
prevented a large set of countries from enjoying the
beneÔ¨Åts of a well-coordinated education and public
research system either as a result of their colonial
heritage or structural policy reforms persist and these
remain a major impediment to the emergence of an
indigenous African agriculture revolution.

2.2.2 Mapping key actors and linkages
Actors or agents operating in the sectoral system
include individuals such as farmers, enterprise owners,
and engineers/ scientists; and organizations including
enterprises universities and Ô¨Årms, R&D departments,
Ô¨Ånancial institutions such as development banks, and
intermediary organisations such as seed banks and
providers of extension services, such as marketing
boards, cooperatives among others. There are
important attributes of the actors that mediate the
innovation process including ownership structures
(whether Ô¨Årms are owned by multinationals or local
entrepreneurs), size and extent of local enterprise,
quality of local research institutes, available human
skills, among others.
Since innovation processes are heterogeneous, factors
and policies that may trigger off optimal interactions
between various systemic counterparts vary from one
country to another. The schematics in Figure 2 captures
some of the triggers to collaboration incentives which
feed into the system from multiple sources namely,
international and national policies, Ô¨Ånance institutions,
physical infrastructure and extension services and
local market orientation of research and products.
A range of externally imposed factors, such as the
multilateral trade regime and intellectual property
rights, play a large role in determining the ways and
means in which innovative capacity is built, sustained
and deepened over time in developing countries.

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2010

A wide variety of governmental agencies, such as
those that provide Ô¨Ånance and help mitigate risk
amongst Ô¨Årms, those that specify and enforce
agriculture-related laws and rules, those that enable
parties to contract and conclude agreements, all play
a key role. Finally agencies that represent collective
demand, such as farmers associations and collectives
are a critical set of actors.
The widely dispersed knowledge base as well as the
complex processes involved in bringing products
from the Ô¨Årm to the farm makes a range of knowledge
interactions critical to competence building within the
AIS:
‚Ä¢ Knowledge interaction between university
departments, centres of excellence and public
research institutes conducting research of
relevance to agriculture;
‚Ä¢ Knowledge interaction between traditional
knowledge holders (farmers communities)
and other more research-based and product
development actors;
‚Ä¢ Knowledge interaction between local and foreign
Ô¨Årms and universities;
‚Ä¢ Knowledge interactions between local and foreign
Ô¨Årms and domestic research institutes;
‚Ä¢ Knowledge interactions between local and foreign
Ô¨Årms engaged in product, service or process
innovations;
‚Ä¢ Knowledge interactions between farmers,
consumers, seed banks and other intermediary
organisations that help gauge local demand and
issues imminent to the agricultural system;
‚Ä¢ Knowledge interactions between farmers and
providers of extension services, such as marketing
boards
‚Ä¢ Knowledge
Interactions
between
various
governmental agencies responsible to promote
these competencies locally.

2.3 INNOVATION AS AN
INTERACTIVE PROCESS
The absence of linkages between the key actors not
only prevents the ability of the agricultural system to
use available knowledge to innovate and respond

resilient in the face of external shocks, such as that
posed by the global food crisis. In the context of
an agriculture system of innovation for countries,
linkages are rendered even more signiÔ¨Åcant due to
two reasons. First, the main users and creators of new
applications (the farmers) are largely unskilled and
uneducated. Second, a majority of the smallholder
farms have functioned in isolation from the African
knowledge and information systems that until now
was the predominant model for promoting agricultural
development in countries. It is their isolation, more
than any other factor that makes them susceptible
to external and internal shocks, and also impedes
their ability to recover and respond. Linkages that
enable them to be well networked into the innovation
system are critical to enable them to consolidate their
activities. This report identiÔ¨Åes the following forms of
linkages to be of importance to policy.

2.3.1 Linkages between scientists and
practitioners, including farmers
Linkages between two potential networks or
communities, namely the scientists and the
practitioners (including farmers), engaged in the
process of agricultural innovation are critical for the
development of productive capacities over time. The
Ô¨Årst is the research-intensive public science, organized
largely around those creating new knowledge through
intensive R&D activities and creative design that initiate
entire processes of innovation. Although it is difÔ¨Åcult to
draw the lines conclusively, basic research (and some
applied) tends to be the domain of universities and
highly advanced public laboratories while Ô¨Årms tend to
focus more on applied and developmental research.
This was largely led by the public sector organisations
even in the industrial countries, up until recent times,
because private Ô¨Årms tend to have little incentive to
engage in socially relevant basic research. In recent
times, trends that promote the commercialization
of university/ public sector research through policy
incentives such as intellectual property rights have
blurred the boundaries between basic and applied
research, as well as tended to promote the privatization
of some basic research. The second is a set of actors
driven largely by commercial motive of translating
inventive or design work into products processes and
services; they are made up of engineers, scientists
and technicians and practitioners, such as farmers.
Both these communities may overlap at times,
and they are found in networks created to advance

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2010

technological innovation. The knowledge base of both
these networks comprising farmers, producers and
organisations grows on the basis of routine learningby-doing where the individual capabilities of actors
are largely tacit.
Public research of relevance to agriculture has suffered
from two concomitant pressures: on the one hand,
research expenditure for agriculture research has been
on the decline and on the other, there has been very
little attention given to applied research and product
development that builds on on-going research in the
local research institutes and universities. Some of this
can be attributed to a widespread attitude of local
actors (including policy makers) that relegates local
research to be of lesser quality and relevance than
international research and technological advances.
Together these factors have resulted in the lack of
collaborative linkages between African scientists,
local technology developers and farm-level activities
which needs to be addressed urgently.

2.3.2 Horizontal linkages between
farmers and extension services
Promoting innovation capabilities among African
farmers will depend on strengthening the linkages
between farm-level users and the extension services
that link them to the markets and other user-producer
networks. Trade liberalization and Ô¨Åscal austerity as a
result of structural adjustment programmes have led
to reduced public investment in extension services
and large-scale abandonment of marketing boards
that served to coordinate farmer production in a wide
variety of ways.54 These exacerbate the already huge
challenges faced by farmers such as the inadequacies
in infrastructure and Ô¨Ånancing mechanisms and weak
linkages between research and on-farm activities.
More recently, evidence suggests that agricultural
reform programmes have shifted to addressing
issues such as inadequate rural infrastructure and
crop storage capacity, the affordability of inputs, the
quality of agricultural research, the accessibility of
credit, the effectiveness of extension services and the
availability of basic social services such as health and
education.55 While this is a step in the right direction,
further strengthening of horizontal linkages is required
to address the non-technological constraints to
agricultural production and innovation as outlined in
Table 1.

CHAPTER II: BUILDING INNOVATION CAPABILITIES IN AFRICAN AGRICULTURE

Table 1. Important non-technological constraints to
agricultural development56
Constraints

Possible solutions

Lack of agronomic
research and
information systems

New models of public-private collaboration
in technology development and
dissemination are needed that will be
pro-active in seeking out, adapting and
disseminating new technology from
international research centres and private
sources

Lack of market-support
services

In cases where improved technologies
have been developed, the ability of farmers
to use them has often been impeded by
high distribution costs, caused by poor
infrastructure, high transaction costs, and
policies that thwart private investment in
the system.

Tax reforms and high
energy, input, and
infrastructure costs

Fiscal beneÔ¨Åts favourable to agriculture,
VAT policies, import duty remissions,
simpliÔ¨Åed tax on gross revenue, export tax,
tariff structures.

The structure and set
of regulations in place
to manage agriculture
activities and resources

Good governance, decentralization, and
farmer empowerment are key to agricultural
transformation and global integration in
this regard;
It is important to address natural resource
depletion (Ô¨Åsheries, forests, water
supplies);
Combat disease, prevent pests;
Manage land and water rights.

2.3.3 Linkages between the farming and
non-farming systems
The prevailing understanding of economic development
and how it occurs leads us to believe that development
results from technological progress that enables
surplus labour and resources to be reallocated to
manufacturing and to services (in the order mentioned
here).57 The evidence on economic development as
seen in a broad range of countries largely substantiates
this view, although there is recent evidence from other
developing countries, such as India that there could
be a direct progression from agriculture to services,
with little focus on manufacturing. Regardless of
this, developing productive capacity for agriculture
in African countries will be a pre-requisite for both
agricultural and non-agricultural development. The
linkages between farming and non-farming activities
are therefore important for a variety of reasons. A
range of non-farming activities generates income for
rural households either through work for wages or
self-employment.58 These activities are predominantly
closely linked to the farming and the food chain and
have potential for employment, income or growth.
Such activities include food and Ô¨Åsh processing,

21

labouring and foreign remittances. Some African
countries, for example, Senegal, have relied on nonfarming activities to make up for 50 per cent of rural
income since 1960s.59
Linking farming with non-farming systems is also
important because although the agricultural innovation
system has its own knowledge base and learning
processes, it is connected indirectly with policies,
activities and processes outside its own sector
boundaries. Some institutions (e.g. basic service and
utility organizations such as security, customs, water
and electricity boards, and research conducted in
universities and research institutes) connect with all
sectors. Cross sector linkages between agriculture
and other sectors result from collaborations between
R&D performers and users with different levels of
knowledge (technical information, Ô¨Åeld experience,
scientiÔ¨Åc research results, among others).60 Agricultural
innovation is also dependent on advances in other
sectors, such as biotechnology, which may have the
potential for agricultural application. It is therefore
important that policy recognises and promotes such
inter-linkages.

2.4 LINKAGES BETWEEN
FARMERS, GLOBAL
NETWORKS AND VALUE
CHAINS
Demand ‚Äìled approaches, such as global value
chains, can be a very useful mode of transfer of
technology and production information (including
quality protocols) in speciÔ¨Åc products that may have
global markets. The past decade has witnessed a
steady integration of several agricultural products
from African countries into established global value
chains, including Ethiopian and Mozambique‚Äôs
Coffee, cut Ô¨Çowers from Kenya, Ethiopia and the
United Republic of Tanzania among others. Integrating
small-holder farmers into global value chains can help
to signiÔ¨Åcantly upgrade their activities by enabling
them to access product design/ delivery information
and also prescribing quality standards that need to
be adhered to. They provide small-holder farmers the
relevant access to the services provided by a network
of information, credit and service providers, suppliers,
buyers and processing companies.
The examples below show how the immense potential
of African production that has remained largely

22

unrealized is being transformed through the initiatives
of grower groups and the private sector enabling
farmers to sell directly to wholesalers by linking African
food producers who normally operate in relative
isolation to international value chains.

2.4.1 Banana value chain: the case of
East Africa
There are several widely varying cultivars of banana,
which are either grown as a staple crop (plantains
and East African highland bananas) or traded as a
commodity on global markets (dessert bananas,
predominantly of one cultivar: Cavendish). The NGO
TechnoServe and the fair trade company AgroFair both
looked at how to transform the banana sector and
change the fortunes of banana farmers by reforming
the market chain. TechnoServe, for example, used
a ‚Äòvalue chain analysis‚Äô approach examining each
step in the life of a banana crop, and identiÔ¨Åed one
important sticking point ‚Äì farmers could not afford to
buy fertilizer or other inputs and banks would not lend
to banana growers. All this made farmers sceptical
about the possibility of turning bananas into a cash
crop, especially as many had lost money to traders
and brokers in the past.
AgroFair, for its part, looked at the value chain of export
bananas. The export Cavendish banana industry is
typically considered high-cost and price-sensitive. On
the cost side, the banana industry exhibits economies
of scale and is highly capital-intensive in both
production and transportation. Since small-holder
farmers cannot reap any scale beneÔ¨Åts, they often
have to bear a high cost price due to low yield and
efÔ¨Åciency. On the price side, global banana markets
play a balancing role in that they Ô¨Åll on a spot basis
the difference between supply and demand. However,
since small-holder farmers often lack the means to
access these markets, their position becomes insecure
if prices are low and/or Ô¨Çuctuating and therefore not
covering the real costs. AgroFair has turned the chain
‚Äòupside-down‚Äô, by pooling the small volumes of small
producers into a stable, marketable offer. The model
places the small banana farmers at the centre of the
value chain and allows them to co-own the AgroFair
company. The producers have an inÔ¨Çuence over the
company‚Äôs commercial policy, are paid dividends
and receive technical and organizational support. This
type of value chain ensures that small banana farmers
receive a fair price and enjoy a long-term, stable
relationship with other players in the value chain. This

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2010

kind of model has shown that small producers can be
good partners in the export banana chain.

2.4.2 Cassava value chain: the case of
Zambia
Cassava, the staple food crop in northern Zambia, saw
rapid production growth over the past Ô¨Åfteen years
(see Figure 3), at times overtaking maize, Zambia‚Äôs
other staple food.
In Zambia, a two-pronged approach to the commercial
promotion of agricultural supply chains was undertaken
to accelerate the production of cassava. This involved
a multi-stakeholder taskforce that identiÔ¨Åed and
addressed bottlenecks, and a team of innovators
who developed markets. The bottlenecks revealed
by the taskforce‚Äôs analysis included, for example, the
absence of trading standards, poorly coordinated
market information, the need to transport produce over
long distances, small volumes and consequently high
marketing margins. The taskforce also identiÔ¨Åed Ô¨Åve
distinct supply channels linking cassava producers
with various Ô¨Ånal markets, ranging from subsistence
consumption to the commercial sale of industrial
starches and related products.
Prior efforts to increase cassava production had
focused largely on a supply-led strategy of promoting
food production among subsistence households.
Instead, the taskforce adopted a demand-led
strategy, focusing on market development in both
trade and upstream processing industries, all of which
stand to beneÔ¨Åt from access to low-cost, cassavabased carbohydrates. The taskforce anticipates
that expanding commercial markets for cassava will
motivate farmers to increase cassava production as
a cash crop. The hope is that as production grows,
household food security will improve too.63
The Zambian experience illustrates the advantages of
an approach that combines value chain analysis with
a stakeholder taskforce that ensure that the team‚Äôs
understanding of opportunities and constraints gets
translated into actions that will facilitate commercial
growth. It should be noted that the increase in
cassava production can also be attributed in part to
the development and introduction of new cassava
varieties by IITA in northern Zambia. These improved
cassava varieties are tolerant to disease and pests,
have early maturity and produce yields up to three
times as large as those of most local varieties.

2.4.3 Other examples
Other innovative models for promoting agricultural
innovations include the case of the Ethiopian cut
Ô¨Çower industry and the Kenyan horticultural industry.
The latter example is primarily a private sector story,
with entrepreneurs and farmers innovating and taking
chances. The interactions and roles played by these
partners are critical for the success of the industry.
The Kenyan horticulture industry beneÔ¨Åted from three
main success factors:
‚Ä¢ External catalysts. This critical role was played by
foreign investors and partners in launching and
expanding the industry. Domestic partners were
equally critical to the industry‚Äôs success. Donors
played a relatively minor role.
‚Ä¢ Learning and experimentation. The industry‚Äôs
success is a testimony to the private sector‚Äôs
capacity to adapt to changing circumstances.
‚Ä¢ Political commitment. The government of Kenya
played an effective facilitating role. Its concern for
smallholder development helped promote their
participation in the industry.64

2.5 CREATING AN ENABLING
ENVIRONMENT FOR
AGRICULTURAL INNOVATION
The International Assessment of Agricultural
Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development
(IAASTD) 2008 report makes the point that ‚ÄúAgriculture
is far more than just the production of food.‚Äù This
argument is supported in the report by a number
of case studies that illustrate that, although macroeconomic policy reforms have had positive effects
on agriculture in some parts of Africa, the overall
impact of the reforms has been slower and less
dramatic than could have been expected. The main
reason for the reforms‚Äô restricted impact is that the
constraints to achieving sustainable agricultural
productivity and increasing yields lie both on and off
the farm. Hence, in many cases, transportation, trade,
and macroeconomic policies have stronger effects
on farmer and trader incentives than do agricultural
sector policies, a point that underscores the need
for better policy coordination across ministries.
Strategies should therefore focus on transforming the
weak points along the food system as a whole, and
avoid too narrow a focus on farming. This calls for

24

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2010

policy coherence. Some examples of best practice in
this regard are already available. For instance, in the
late 1990s, the Ghanaian Ministry of Agriculture was
authorized to coordinate the budget requests of Ô¨Åve
other ministries whose activities had a strong impact
on agriculture.65

2.5.1 What is an enabling environment?
An enabling environment is a broad concept that
has been interpreted in numerous ways. A broad
deÔ¨Ånition could comprise all factors external to
Ô¨Årms, including the policy, legal, and regulatory
framework; governance and institutions; physical
security, the social and cultural context of business,
macroeconomic policies, access of Ô¨Årms to Ô¨Ånancial
and business services, and the availability of physical
and social infrastructure services.66 This report deÔ¨Ånes
an enabling environment for innovation as one that
provides the resources required for building a complex
multidimensional and dynamic range of knowledge,
skills, actors, institutions and policies within speciÔ¨Åc
political-policy structures to transform knowledge
into useful processes, products and services for
agriculture. More speciÔ¨Åcally, it comprises policies and
infrastructure (scientiÔ¨Åc, human resources and physical
infrastructure) that leads to building capabilities for
agricultural innovation and production.
The core aspects of an enabling environment
include:
‚Ä¢ the broader framework for innovation, including
legal and regulatory framework for farmers (with
land tenure, rule of law and access to justice); the
policy framework for technology development,
transfer and utilization, including competition
policy; and credit infrastructure;
‚Ä¢ the institutional and organizational framework
concerned with the design, implementation or
compliance of policies and programmes for
the regulation, promotion and representation of
farmers; and
‚Ä¢ the provision of physical infrastructure, including
roads, ports, water, electricity, irrigation facilities,
and internet infrastructure
‚Ä¢ dedicated policies for agricultural capabilities
that foster collaborative linkages and networking
abilities; foster greater information and knowledge
Ô¨Çow; and lastly enhance coordination of policies
and actors.

‚Ä¢ policy incentives that help the agriculture system
of innovation to cope with external shocks
and constraints, including those posed by
obligations under the international trade regime
and intellectual property rights on traditional
agriculture.
Such an enabling environment would urgently need
to address the role of the state to produce optimum
levels of public goods, including agricultural research;
the externalities of technology use that call for
regulatory frameworks, such as biosafety; and the
market weaknesses in developing countries that lead
to high transaction costs related to information search,
and structuring and enforcing contracts. These
failures call for greater public investment in research,
regulation and institutional capacity development to
foster growth.67
The capacity for regulatory functions and enforcements
of systems of innovation differ, even among advanced
countries, but these differences are more pronounced
still between African countries and some have limited
regulatory and institutional capacity for dealing with
imported technologies or creating their own. Moreover,
innovation processes are heterogeneous, factors
and policies that may trigger off optimal interactions
between various systemic counterparts may vary from
one country to another. Some models of the enabling
framework may work well in particular countries, while
some variations may be required to promote agriculture
innovation in others. Despite these observations, the
core aspects identiÔ¨Åed here are critical components
of enabling structural transformation of African
agriculture. Policies designed on the core aspects
identiÔ¨Åed here set the rules of the game not only for
the transfer and dissemination of technology, but
also inÔ¨Çuence the development and performance of
markets, greater investment and reduce the costs
of conducting business in a resource-constrained
environment. Consciously creating the enabling
environment through a set of mutually coordinated
policies is therefore critical to enhancing the capacity
of the AIS to produce and use new knowledge, which
is fundamental to addressing agricultural and rural
development challenges.
Many attempts to introduce new technologies have
failed because they do not adequately address the
enabling environment within which the technology
is to be absorbed, applied and used. For example,
while the deployment of agricultural technologies
may increase farm yields, these gains can be offset

25

CHAPTER II: BUILDING INNOVATION CAPABILITIES IN AFRICAN AGRICULTURE

by failures in the distribution network leading to high
rates of spoilage.

2.5.2 Strengthening the enabling
environment through appropriate
policies
A number of policies are needed to strengthen the
enabling environment for agricultural innovation in the
African context. Viewing sectors or countries through
an innovation policy lens lends acknowledgement
to a long-overdue fact: that without considering all
the key aspects of capacity. Including education
and skills building, knowledge-led development will
remain a myth. Ex-ante decisions on various aspects
of innovation capacity, such as a country‚Äôs schooling
system, its preferences for secondary and tertiary
education (whether there should be greater emphasis
on natural sciences or other disciplines, whether there
should be centres of excellence for tertiary education),
investment into public sector research ‚Äì all impact
upon the generation of human skills and availability
of knowledge infrastructure to build technological
capabilities.68 These are precisely the factors that
have circumscribed the potential of African agricultural

systems to innovate and respond to both internal
and external opportunities. An innovation systems
approach to agricultural policy not only helps to
identify these long-term policy lapses, but also helps
to suggest short and mid-term policy Ô¨Åxes to address
the issue of capabilities required for agriculture.
These short and mid-term policy Ô¨Åxes are identiÔ¨Åed
here. In addition to what is listed here, longer term
macroeconomic harmonization, rural development
and pro-poor policies, policies for education and
human resource development, as well as commodity
development and enterprise policies will play a role in
creating a proper enabling environment.

2.5.3 Policies for physical infrastructure
and extension services
Technological innovations do not proceed in isolation,
they are accompanied by social, institutional and
organisational innovations that facilitate technical
change in the Ô¨Årst place, and promote the adoption
and use of technologies in particular socio-cultural
contexts. The presence of physical infrastructure - good
roads, ports and airports, internet and communication
technologies, water, electricity, irrigation - is a

fundamental pre-requisite for transforming farming
operations into more competitive modes.70
Policies need to focus on improving the physical
infrastructure based on a comprehensive approach
that integrates post-harvest storage and processing
considerations to reduce losses and add value to
agricultural products. This includes the distribution
and marketing infrastructure that links farmers to
markets. Physical infrastructure must support the
capacity of African countries to rehabilitate and
develop rural and agricultural infrastructure through
investments in: (a) marketing processing and storage
facilities; (c) irrigation facilities; and (d) relevant
modes of transportation. Investment in essential
infrastructure and services for rural communities can
provide considerable potential for rural job creation in
farming, agro-processing and rural industry.
Policies that focus on extension services should
strengthen agricultural institutions as appropriate
under national conditions to build efÔ¨Åcient, effective
and novel forms of agricultural marketing venues.
Policies can also focus on identifying and promoting
the use of simple technologies that can increase farm
outputs and link farmers with agricultural research
institutions and markets. For example, buyer-seller
networks for agricultural produce can be organised
through mobile phone networks, and such schemes
have been introduced in some countries such as
Bangladesh. Other extension services, such as
farmers‚Äô organizations, cooperatives, enterprise
associations, drought observatories and weather
stations, need to be strengthened through greater
funding and manpower allotments, or public private
partnerships. Most importantly, organisations must
be equipped with the capacities to address the
economic, social and environmental impacts on
agriculture and the affected communities through
participatory approaches that involve civil society,
local communities, indigenous people and other
major stakeholders, including in particular women
who are often marginalized in decision-making and
policy formulation. For example, the evaluation of
post-harvest technologies is best undertaken with
the participation of stakeholders and the introduction
and operation of a fair and practical grading system
that must be supported by training and extension to
improve handling, storage and packing, sorting and
grading practices.

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2010

2.5.4 Policies that promote the
complementary roles of private
and public investment
Agricultural development in the technologically
advanced countries has been promoted mainly
through government-based R&D, which Ô¨Ågures
as the most important policy instrument for the
sector, followed by other regulatory measures that
allow for commercialization of research results,
technology transfer and the creation of intermediary
organizations and extension services. As of 2008, the
United States government still funds 57 per cent of all
basic research and approximately half of all applied
research conducted in the country. The business
sector invested mostly in applied research and 90 per
cent of all product development activities.71
The specialization of actors as well as complementarities
involved is further demonstrated through some
examples. The United States spent an estimated $54
billions on basic research, $ 66.4 billion on applied
research and $187.3 billion on development in 2006.
In proportional terms, these are 18.7 per cent, 21.3
per cent and 60.0 per cent respectively of total R&D
spending. Out of these, private Ô¨Årms in the United
States spend three times more on applied than on
basic research. Industrial research is in fact dominated
by developmental research, which accounts for 90.2
per cent of development work carried out in the
country in 2004; universities and related actors spend
less than 2 per cent on development research (NSF,
2006). Over 60 per cent of all labour available in Africa
is engaged in agriculture and this call for reinforced
public investments into research and extension
services to enhance innovation capacity.

2.5.4.1 Financing smallholder farmers
Financing for productive activities is often a central
constraint for farmers and Ô¨Årms alike. The problem
is generally especially intense for informal sector
enterprises and small-holder farmers. Indeed, the
single most commonly reported obstacle to investment
and entrepreneurship in the non-farm rural economy
is inadequate access to capital.72 This is an important
handicap, particularly in light of inadequate public
sector investment in agriculture in these countries,
which means that the issue of inadequate Ô¨Ånancing
and unmet Ô¨Ånancing gaps undermines both private
sector and public sector action to improve agricultural
performance. Financial systems in most low-

CHAPTER II: BUILDING INNOVATION CAPABILITIES IN AFRICAN AGRICULTURE

income African countries remain at an early stage of
development, and Ô¨Ånancing of productive activity, and
innovative activity in particular, is a major challenge.
MicroÔ¨Ånance initiatives have proven to be a successful
institutional innovation in Ô¨Ånancial services for microentrepreneurs, including small-holder farmers, in
some developing countries. There is a need to scale
up such initiatives for smallholder farmers where they
have already proved successful. There is also a need
to both replicate such schemes in other countries
where they could work well, and develop other
institutional innovations of this kind in situations where
microÔ¨Ånance might not be well suited. The need for
such Ô¨Ånancial service innovations for agriculture is
becoming increasingly widely acknowledged.73 Policy
support is required also to promote other potential
sources of credit for smallholder farmers, including
suppliers credit, agricultural development banks,
outgrower programmes.

2.5.4.2 New Ô¨Ånancial instruments and
barriers to private investment
In the light of the Ô¨Ånancial crisis and its impact on
African countries, there seems to be a need to consider
segmenting banking systems in order to protect some
extremely vulnerable parts of the economy from external
shocks. One suggestion that has been made in this
regard is that of creating specialized banks for such
sectors as agriculture and SMEs, which may not appear
very attractive to private banks since their sole focus is
on proÔ¨Åtability.74 This and other new Ô¨Ånancial instruments
that cater speciÔ¨Åcally to farmers need to be devised.
Senior African scholars, policy-makers, and private sector
representatives suggest the way forward to building an
enabling environment for increased and sustainable
investment in African agricultural development should
include the following three dimensions: (a) governments
should provide core public goods to stimulate investment
in agriculture; (b) public sector interventions should
be a catalyst for innovations that can be sustained by
the private sector; and (c) improved data systems are
needed to monitor investment in agriculture and the
effectiveness of public expenditures.75 Here targeted
policy interventions should focus on the following:
‚Ä¢ addressing the links between livelihoods and
issues of poverty and vulnerability to understand
the complexities of livelihood strategies that
inÔ¨Çuence the choices of speciÔ¨Åc farming and
food systems;

27

‚Ä¢ monitoring markets and consumer trends, and
promoting technology and innovation choices
that will be relevant to alleviate hunger, address
local needs and enhance productivity; and,
‚Ä¢ creating new organisations to help farmers cope
with the emerging environmental and biological
challenges.
Most research that focuses on barriers to private
investment fails to focus on investment in agriculture.
This is problematic because constraints to rural
investment can be quite different from those
affecting urban enterprises.76 Private investments
in agriculture depend on the ability of the state to
provide basic marketing and infrastructure services.
The governments therefore need to take the lead in
eliminating structural barriers to agricultural production
and innovation. In Mozambique, for example,
the three most important constraints to private
investment in agriculture include: (a) lack of secure
and transferable land tenure and land-use rights;
(b) the pervasive problem of infrastructure (roads,
bridges, electricity, marketing and storage, ports,
irrigation); and (c) problems in Ô¨Ånancing, particularly
difÔ¨Åculties in lending to agriculture and the need for
sustainable and innovative solutions such as supply
chain Ô¨Ånancing, warehouse receipts, microÔ¨Ånance
techniques, mobile phone banking, point-of-service
terminals, credit cooperatives etc. Another study by the
National Centre for Agricultural Economics and Policy
Research (NCAP) in India found that private investment
in agriculture is affected by: (a) public investments;
(b) institutional credit provided for medium and long
term purposes i.e. loans for creation of asset; and (c)
terms of trade (TOT) for agriculture. A separate study,
also in India, indicates a strong link between private
and public investments in agricultural marketing
infrastructure.77 The analysis found that, when private
investment is made in agricultural production, public
investment for the promotion of agricultural marketing
infrastructure soon follows.
While private investment is a complement that needs
to be attracted through appropriate policy measures,
focusing solely on private investments will not be a
sufÔ¨Åcient condition to create productive capacities in
agriculture. Private investments are normally motivated
by expected returns relative to perceived risks. These
risks and returns are determined by market conditions
both global and local, and more often than not, global.
It is therefore important to identify appropriate roles
for, and relationships among, the public and private

28

sectors, other elements of civil society, (such as
farmer and trader associations) national and local
governments, regional organizations, donors, and
private voluntary and NGOs. Private investment into
agriculture can also be promoted through publicprivate partnerships with the international private
sector and national agricultural organisations.
Agriculture should also be made a sectoral priority in
other policies that seek to attract international private
sector, such as policies for foreign direct investment,
with a special focus and additional incentives for Ô¨Årms
to engage in tacit know-how transfer to local actors.

2.5.5 Policies that promote linkages
between local farmers and other
actors in the AIS
Incentive systems tend to develop from more
fundamental institutional roots such as labour laws
and even national constitution. Terms of employment
and work environments, both tangible (research and
teaching facilities) and intangible (possibilities for
institutional collaboration, quality of networks and
colleagues) play a pivotal role in retaining skilled
professionals. States have been involved in promoting
academic-industry exchange by encouraging channels
of learning, such as: joint publications, mobility of
scientists and engineers, cooperative R&D, facility
sharing, research training (e.g. capacity development
at PhD level, international and local exchange of staff),
and academic entrepreneurship.61 A range of targeted
policy interventions are necessary to ensure that farmers
are well inter-connected with other practitioners and
science-suppliers in the agricultural innovation system.

2.5.5.1 Improve existing markets and
services
Developing and improving existing markets and trade
services is important for the livelihoods, economic
sustainability and, ultimately, the food security of rural
communities. The objective should be to develop
sustainable agricultural value chains and improve
farmers‚Äô and agro-industry enterprises‚Äô access to, and
participation in, markets. This development could be
supported by: (a) actively increasing market efÔ¨Åciencies
and access, especially to the markets for high valueadded agricultural exports, including processed
agricultural exports; (b) putting in place marketing
information systems; and (c) designing and implementing
trade facilitation programmes. The aim should be to

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2010

create plans to increase both the quantity and quality of
production of smallholder farmers, as well as smallholder
value-added in local markets, including by increasing the
contribution of local communities‚Äô products. The ultimate
aim is to substantially increase the income of farmers, in
particular smallholder and family farmers.

2.5.5.2 Create new organisations for
collaborative learning
Three speciÔ¨Åc forms of policy interventions are critical
to promote collaborations between farmers and other
actors in the AIS:
‚Ä¢ those that those that support the commercialisation
of publicly funded agricultural research: such policy
support mechanisms are often extremely essential in
both promoting mobility of scientiÔ¨Åc labour between
public sector science and industry and also ensuring
that public funded research is more outcome-oriented.
Policies that promote this include technology link
foundations.
‚Ä¢ those that reduce the risk of innovative activities
through Ô¨Ånance: support mechanisms here include
government-support soft-loans, R&D subsidies, public
risk capital funds, public support for private enterprise
through grants, subsidies, private equity, Policies
that could promote these (from a review of literature)
include: seed-Ô¨Ånancing programmes, business angels
networks, enterprise subsidy programmes, common
placement funds for innovation and research tax credit
programmes.
‚Ä¢ Those that provide other forms of business and
marketing support, including technology incubation
facilities, and competence centres that provide
expertise such as legal affairs and marketing.
These need to be enabled through the creation of new
organisations, or revision of roles and competencies
of existing organisations responsible for supporting
agricultural development within African countries. The
impact and the effectiveness of policy interventions
should be monitored and assessed using a set of
domestic policy indicators for policy review, monitoring
and evaluation.

2.5.5.3 Linking R&D to Firms and Farms
The transfer of agricultural technologies is an
outcome of demand and supply to meet the needs
of the farming community (see Figure 4). Many of the
necessary measures such as Ô¨Ånancing mechanisms,

29

CHAPTER II: BUILDING INNOVATION CAPABILITIES IN AFRICAN AGRICULTURE

capacity building, and regulatory environment all relate
to the development of enabling environment and thus
contribute to the transfer of technologies. Resources
spent on promoting research and development
activities need to be linked to local demand for speciÔ¨Åc
products, processes and services in agriculture.
Experiences in other countries show that incentives
to achieve this include restructuring academic
systems (for researchers and academics) to reward
applied research and collaborations with agricultural
communities and Ô¨Årms, create special R&D grants
that are only for the development of speciÔ¨Åc local
varieties of food grains, among others.
Transfer of technology should be promoted through
a variety of mechanisms, including licensing, foreign
direct investment, joint ventures, public-private
partnerships (PPPs). Modes of technology transfer
that focus on tacit know-how transfer and human
capacity building need to be fostered. The rate of
technology transfer is affected not only by access to
such technologies, but also by the ability of actors to
absorb. Both types of factors can be inÔ¨Çuenced by
policy.79 Special education and training programmes
designed for farmers need to be promoted in order
to augment their capacity to use and apply new
technologies.

2.5.5.4 Facilitating access to inputs
through smart subsidies and credit
In 2006, African Union Member States resolved to
increase Africa‚Äôs average level of both inorganic and
organic fertilizer use from 8 kg per hectare currently to
at least 50 kg per hectare by 2015. Achieving this goal
will require speciÔ¨Åc actions to improve farmers‚Äô access
to good quality fertilizers both directly and indirectly.78
For this purpose, the Summit identiÔ¨Åed a number
of supply- and demand-side constraints that must
be addressed (see table 3) and called on Member
States to: (a) eliminate taxes and tariffs on fertilizers
and fertilizer raw materials by mid-2007; (b) develop
quality-control standards for fertilizers; (c) develop
and scale-up both private and community-based
fertilizer use/access; (d) grant targeted subsidies to
help the poorest farmers, especially women farmers
and/or farmers lacking land title in order to increase
fertilizer use among these groups; (e) devise Ô¨Åscal
incentives that encourage farmers and suppliers to
invest in productivity-enhancing procedures; and (f)
establish national and regional Ô¨Ånancing facilities to
help suppliers of agricultural inputs receive credit,
develop business plans, and make sustainable
investments.

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2010

Having studied the fertilizer subsidy systems in
Kenya and Malawi, the Kenya Institute for Public
Policy Research and Analysis, Tegemeo Institute of
Agricultural Policy and Development and the Future
Agricultures Consortium presented recommendations
on the key question of how subsidies can be made
effective and efÔ¨Åcient (i.e. ‚Äòsmart‚Äô). They concluded
that:
‚Ä¢ Small-holder farmers, not large farmers, are the
ones who need subsidies to buy fertilizer and other
inputs. Vouchers are therefore suitable instruments
to direct subsidies to the small-holder farmers who
need them most.
‚Ä¢ At the same time, subsidies should help the
development of networks of input dealers, rather
than undercutting them. Rather than having fertilizer
distributed directly by state agencies, fertilizer
should be channelled through existing dealers.
‚Ä¢ Judicious intervention in maize markets to ensure
that prices remunerate farmers while providing
consumers with affordable food is an important
complement to subsidies.
‚Ä¢ Fertilizer subsidies attract political interest.
Monitoring the costs and results of subsidies, and
publicising the results of monitoring, is one way to
encourage politicians to consider the effectiveness
of subsidies.
Determined to improve the country‚Äôs food productivity, the
government of Kenya has begun offering a form of subsidy
to its farmers under the National Accelerated Agricultural
Inputs Programme. One of the overall objectives
according to the government is to remove the concept of
subsistence farming altogether and transform farming into

a commercial enterprise. The targeted or smart subsidy
scheme that was initiated in 2008 is initially targeted to
45 districts with a view to reaching 2.5 million households
with affordable farm inputs within three to Ô¨Åve years. The
programme allows beneÔ¨Åciaries to receive vouchers to
buy farm inputs ‚Äì seeds, fertilizers and chemicals‚Äîfrom
selected dealers. The government redeems the vouchers
using commercial banks. The targeted beneÔ¨Åciaries are
poor and vulnerable groups with less than an acre of land
and those who rely on relief foods.
Malawi, the United Republic of Tanzania, Nigeria, Ghana,
Mali, Mozambique, Rwanda, Burkina Faso and Senegal
are now offering smart subsidies.

2.5.5.5 Building partnerships between
small- and large-scale farmers
Farmer groups, cooperatives and other partnerships
are important institutions for Ô¨Ålling the gaps left by both
government and the private sector. They provide guarantees
with regards to investments, supply of agricultural inputs
(seeds and fertilizers) and credits, and are a suitable
platform for education and training. Cooperatives also
provide opportunities for marketing agricultural products,
particularly in the case of smallholders who, in most
cases, are not able to meet quantitative and qualitative
thresholds and therefore rely on communal storage and
marketing instruments. In Brazil, cooperatives have been
instrumental in linking small-holder farmers into the agrifood chain. Box 5 summarizes some of the achievements
of an African initiative on partnerships. Such partnerships
enable and enhance agricultural entrepreneurship and
thus strengthen rural development.

Box 2: Accomplishments of partnerships: the AGRA experience
The Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA) has developed groundbreaking partnerships between African and global institutions to address key issues such as seeds, soils, market access and policies, and a crosscutting programme on innovative Ô¨Ånancing programme that is delivering $17 million in loan guarantee funds to
leverage $160 million in affordable loans from commercial banks for smallholder farmers, agro-dealers and smalland medium-sized agricultural enterprises. This has resulted in strengthened national networks of agro-dealers in
11 countries. In parts of western Kenya served by the programme, maize productivity has increased by 115 per
cent, and the distance farmers must travel to buy precious farm inputs like good seeds has been cut from 17km
to 4km. In the area of seed development, funding of farmer participatory crop-breeding has led to the release of
68 locally adapted varieties of crops such as cassava, bean, sorghum, and maize. Many of these varieties incorporate traits from varieties developed by the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR)
and Africa‚Äôs national research organizations, along with farmers‚Äô own traditional varieties. Twenty four small- and
medium-sized seed companies and cooperatives have experienced a near doubling of their seed production in
two years.

CHAPTER II: BUILDING INNOVATION CAPABILITIES IN AFRICAN AGRICULTURE

Table 3. Supply/demand constraints to fertilizer use in Africa81
SUPPLY-SIDE CONSTRAINTS

DEMAND-SIDE CONSTRAINTS

Risks associated with certain policy environment:
Repeated and unpredictable government interventions creating an
uncertain environment for the private fertilizer sector.
A stable policy environment reduces risks, which is an essential
condition if private sector agribusiness is to assume fertilizer
marketing functions and develop domestic fertilizer demand

ProÔ¨Åtability of Use:
Profitability of fertilizer use as reflected in high input/output ratios
affects farmers‚Äô demand for fertilizer. Profitable use of fertilizer is a
function of technical and economic factors.
Use of fertilizer should be accompanied by improved seed
varieties and suitable soils. Fertilizer use also needs to be
accompanied by knowledge of how to fertilizers, which fertilizers
are appropriate for which crops/soil type/climate, etc.
In addition, the cost of getting fertilizer to the farm-gate affects
profitability.

Institutional Risks:
Continuous procedural changes to laws and regulations of
direct consequence for fertilizer marketing constitutes a major
impediment for market entry when risk aversion on the part of rural
decision makers translates into high fertilizer prices (traders) and
hence ensures low demand (farmers).

Commodity markets:
Demand for fertilizer is conditioned by farmers‚Äô access to output
markets.
Markets may be uncompetitive or even exploitative, or farmers may
have to travel exceptionally long distances to access them.

InsufÔ¨Åcient Human Capital:
The fertilizer sector is characterized by insufficient and underqualified human capital such as a limited number of fertilizer
importers and wholesalers;
poor spread of input dealer networks in rural areas;
low business and technical capacity of dealers;
farmers must travel long distances to purchase fertilizer;
small number of producer and trader associations;
lack of marketing skills and qualified input dealers;
weak linkages between input dealers, importers, and wholesalers;
and lack of proper knowledge about fertilizer capabilities and their
profitable use.

Commodity Prices:
The ratio of output price to fertilizer price conditions fertilizer
use. Fertilizer use is concentrated on the most profitable crops.
Commodity prices are a function of the strength of demand
for a crop commodity, government price policies, transport
infrastructure, storage facilities, market information, and seasonal
variability in demand and supply.

Limited Access to Credit:
Lack of access to finance constrains the ability of fertilizer
importers, wholesalers, and dealers to raise sufficient funds at
the opportune time to purchase fertilizer and/or for business
development. In addition, high interest rates and exhaustive
collateral requirements are unattractive for fertilizer importers and
input dealers.

Perception of Yield Responsiveness to Fertilizer:
Farmers‚Äô perception about the potential impact of fertilizers on
yield also affects demand. Their understanding is influenced by
the quantity and quality of information available on fertilizer and by
their access to that information.

Lack of market information:
Information on fertilizer prices, imports and exports, and
availability by market and product in Africa is inadequate.
Availability of such information reduces transaction costs via
increased transparency in market transactions.

Fertilizer Price:
African farmers pay the highest price for fertilizers in the world. For
example, the ratio of farm-gate price to cost, insurance, and freight
ranges from 1.42 for the United States to 2.04 and 2.56 for Nigeria
and Angola respectively.
Domestic marketing costs in many African countries account for
more than 50% of the farm-gate price of fertilizer.

Infrastructure:
Internal transport costs are high in African countries.
Infrastructure development is critical for fertilizer distribution and
for connecting farmers to markets, as each ton of fertilizer used
could lead to transportation of 15 tons of grain.

Prices and availability of substitutes and complements, capacity to
invest, and the prices of different fertilizer nutrients, water, seeds,
organic matter, and even farm labour can all impact the use of
fertilizer.

2.6 THE ROLE OF
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
RIGHTS IN SMALL-SCALE
FARMING

several other African countries have devised their
own sui generis regimes that cater to their particular
contexts. Policy choices on these issues will determine
the space available for agricultural innovation and
needs to be evaluated carefully.

Intellectual Property (IP) touches on a wide range of
issues from increased costs for agricultural inputs
(cultivars, fertilizers, pesticides, production protocols,
etc.) to outputs (improved seeds, harvesting, storage,
etc.). It is important that African countries assess
and prioritize the IP issues (trademarks, patents,
geographical indicators, plant breeder‚Äôs protection,
and traditional knowledge) according to their short-,
medium- and long-term implications on their modes
of agricultural productivity. This necessitates an
understanding of international norms, Ô¨Çexibilities and/
or exceptions applicable to farmers in developing
countries.

The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the
International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for
Food and Agriculture (PGRFA) regulate the transfer of
biological or genetic resources. PGRFA established
the Multilateral System of Access and BeneÔ¨Åt sharing
covering crops that supply 80 per cent of all human
consumption to be made available through Standard
Material Transfer Agreements (MTAs). These MTAs
regulate the transfer of biological or genetic resources
between two parties. The terms and conditions
of transfer have not yet been fully negotiated but
it seems likely that the transfer of materials from
industry to public or private institutions may include
more restrictive conditions than if the transfer was
between two academic institutions.84 Policy, therefore
also is needed to address research exemptions and
other Ô¨Çexibilities allowed by the TRIPS Agreement that
will be important to promote agricultural research and
development.

The impact of strong intellectual property rights (IPR) on
developing countries‚Äô access to foreign technologies
and on domestic technological development remain
controversial questions, especially for LDCs where the
conditions for successful absorption and adaptation
may be weaker than in other countries due to weaker
science, technology and innovation (STI) capabilities
and greater deÔ¨Åciencies in infrastructure, Ô¨Ånancing
and other areas that have an effect on the scope for
technological development. The empirical evidence
on the impacts of IPRs on agriculture in developing
countries is scant and ambiguous.82 Some analysts
fear that strong protection of intellectual property
rights is likely to hinder rather than to facilitate
technology transfer and indigenous learning activities
in developing countries.83 The scope for protection
of traditional agricultural knowledge under the
Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual
Property rights (TRIPS Agreement) has emerged
as a key issue for developing countries, both within
and outside of Africa. The Agreement provides a
choice between patents and a sui generis system (a
system of its own) for plant variety protection. Several
African countries have adopted the Union of Plant
Varieties (UPOV) 1978 and 1991 conventions as their
sui generis regimes, regardless of their impact on
their local contexts. Literature on the point has been
particularly vocal on the fact that the UPOV 1991
convention especially does not contain provisions to
cater to the needs of farmers in developing countries,
and expressly prevents them from saving seeds to
sow back in subsequent seasons. At the same time,

In general, MTAs establish the rights of the material
providers and recipients, the obligations of the recipient
to inform the provider of any patent claims and/or
innovations leading to a patent. Often, the ownership
remains with the provider, including the rights to
transfer to other parties.85 Depending on the nature,
mandate and orientation of the biological material
provider, the MTA may encourage the dissemination
and exchange of the materials. Similarly, the nature of
the materials and their value (if the material is subject
to a patent or to be commercialized) may inÔ¨Çuence
the inclusion of restrictive conditions in MTA.
The CGIAR genebanks hold in trust the genetic material
of a vast number of food and agriculture crops, and this
genetic material is freely available (see Box 3). Without
doubt, the single most readily applicable source of
practical technologies for smallholder farmers lies
in the many best practice methodologies developed
by international and national centres of agricultural
expertise. The FAO and CGIAR, in particular, offer an
immense variety of information useful for improving
smallholder productivity.

CHAPTER II: BUILDING INNOVATION CAPABILITIES IN AFRICAN AGRICULTURE

33

Box 3: CGIAR genebanks: plant genetic resources for food86
The CGIAR seed collections are a unique resource, available to all researchers. The eleven International Agricultural Research Centres (IARCs) of the CGIAR signed agreements with the Governing Body of the International Treaty on Plant
Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (PGRFA) on 16 October 2006 to place the ex situ collections of PGRFA held by
those centres (some 650,000 accessions of the world‚Äôs most important crops) within the purview of the Treaty. Under these
agreements, the centres recognize the authority of the Governing Body of the Treaty to provide policy guidance relating to
their ex situ collections (i.e. collections of seeds stored in genebanks).
As from 1 January 2007, the centres have been using the Standard Material Transfer Agreement (SMTA) adopted by the
Governing Body of the Treaty for transfers of PGRFA of crops and forages. From 1 February 2008, the Centres have been
transferring all plant genetic resources for food and agriculture they hold in trust - using the SMTA.
Seed contributions have helped lay the foundations of recovery by jumpstarting agricultural growth in countries emerging from conÔ¨Çict such as Afghanistan, Angola, Mozambique, and Somalia. They have also helped countries recover from
natural disasters such as Hurricane Mitch which struck Honduras and Nicaragua. A recent study showed that of the more
than one million seed samples distributed over the past 10 years, the vast majority (80 per cent or more) went to universities
and national agricultural research systems where scientists are developing new crop varieties that give higher yields, have
improved nutritional value, use less water, need lower amounts of fertilizers, and have natural resistance to pests, diseases
and climatic vagaries such as droughts and Ô¨Çoods.

2.6.1 Open innovation and other
alternate approaches
Open, collaborative approaches to innovation can
promote productivity and the competitiveness of
farmers, and a number of developing countries
are already engaged in open innovation systems.
Developing countries will beneÔ¨Åt more from open
innovation by bridging the digital divide, which can
help facilitate collaborative research, informationsharing and global partnerships.
For innovation to be relevant to developing countries‚Äô
economies, it must be seen as a means of introducing
useful products and adding new value. R&D or
technology must therefore be accompanied by the
tapping into knowledge of other institutions such as
universities, research centres and Ô¨Årms including
competitors. This open approach to innovation must
be supported by science, technology and innovation
policies. This involves addressing issues pertaining
to intellectual property rights, increasing the intensity
of R&D and actively attracting leading researchers.
Among the wider policy issues are local infrastructure,
investment
incentives,
favourable
regulatory
frameworks and helpful administrative processes and
building capacity to negotiate agreements in order to
become effective innovators.
Open source or non-proprietary models are evolving
to harness the full potential of a combined academic‚Äì
philanthropic‚Äìbusiness approach. For example,
collaboration between the University of Berkeley
and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation provides
grants for the development of nutritionally enhanced

sorghum seeds to be made available for royalty-free
distribution in areas of need.87 Many other royalty-free
development programmes are being conducted by
various universities and research institutes around the
world, including the HarvestPlus initiative coordinated
by CGIAR for improving the micronutrient content
of rice, wheat, maize, cassava, sweet potato and
beans.
The advent of GMOs has led to a much wider
licensing model due to the nature of farming, which
requires growers to sign a ‚ÄòSeed Partner Agreement‚Äô
with leading agricultural biotechnology companies,
prohibiting them from replanting seed. Under this
model it is possible for the inventing company to have
many hundreds of seed partner licensees around the
world. In this case too, socially responsible licensing
is also starting to become more common within the
agricultural biotech sector. One such example is the
African Agricultural Technology Foundation (AATF)
which is facilitating drought-tolerant maize varieties
known as WEMA (Water EfÔ¨Åcient Maize for Africa)
speciÔ¨Åcally intended for small-scale farmers. AATF
will work with the International Maize and Wheat
Improvement Center (CIMMYT), the private agricultural
company Monsanto and the national agricultural
research systems in the participating countries.
Another important source of technology solutions is
to be found in the academic literature covering every
aspect of agricultural improvement. A number of
journal articles have never been the subject of copyright
protection and are therefore free to use. Although
most leading journals are based on a subscription
membership, researchers in developing countries can

34

obtain free access to most of the leading publications
through the AGORA system set up by FAO. However,
the sheer volume of technical publications is daunting
and many hours may be needed to identify just a few
practical recommendations applicable to a given
topic.

2.8 SUMMARY
Regardless of the theoretical viewpoints on the kind
of approach best-suited to promoting agricultural
development, the fundamental issue for a policy
maker is how such an approach can be used to devise
an agriculture development strategy. The innovation
systems framework can be useful to help identify areas
of weakness that could ideally be addressed through
national policy action. A key issue is how to promote
capabilities among African farmers and develop more
effective innovation systems for agriculture at the
national and sub-national levels.
This chapter has recommended an agricultural innovation
systems approach as a policy instrument for African
agriculture. Agriculture development strategies that
incorporate the main components of the AIS approach
can be transformed into a workable concept at the country
level. The AIS approach depends on identifying the key
actors and linkages that together strengthen knowledge
Ô¨Çows and enable interactive learning that is important to
build capabilities for agriculture. The linkages between
these actors derive from two major sources: the policies
and institutions (including the constitution, laws, rules,
regulations and by-laws) are a very important to guide
individual behaviour. Laws, rules and regulations offer
speciÔ¨Åc incentives to individuals or groups to collaborate
and engage in mutual learning. A second form of
linkages derives from socio-political-historical attitudes
and practices (that could stem from cultural norms) that
dictate how or why individuals interact and what beneÔ¨Åts
they perceive from such interactions. The chapter has
identiÔ¨Åed short-term and mid-term policy actions that are
meant to guide policy makers to enact the AIS approach
within their national contexts.
The characteristics of these systems may vary
signiÔ¨Åcantly between (and even within) countries,

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2010

which makes country-speciÔ¨Åc analysis necessary, but
there remain some common issues that affect many
African countries to a greater or lesser extent.
Common challenges include poor linkages between
farmers and others in food value chains and the
research and education systems, weak bridging
institutions between the two (extension services, for
example), inadequacies in infrastructure and Ô¨Ånancing
mechanisms, and policy frameworks that do not provide
adequate support for smallholder famers or may even
create disincentives to technological development or
innovation. Policy-makers need to ensure that national
agricultural research systems involve farmers fully as
partners, and gear research to solving the pressing
production problems that they face. There is also a
need for institutional innovations and different ways
of organizing smallholders, linking them better to
knowledge Ô¨Çows and to potential markets for their
produce, and policy options to enable these have also
been identiÔ¨Åed in the chapter. The speciÔ¨Åc policies
needed at the national level will depend on existing
capabilities and human and Ô¨Ånancial resources, the
political, social and institutional contexts and agroecological conditions.
Adequate policy space is necessary to implement
appropriate policies. Promoting the sharing
of experiences and relevant knowledge Ô¨Çows
internationally and at the national level provide a
starting point. Designing effective public policies,
however, requires adequately prepared policy-makers
and may entail some degree of experimentation to
Ô¨Ånd what works best in a speciÔ¨Åc situation.
There are other gains that Ô¨Çow from agriculture to
non-agriculture based systems that will be important
in the African context, and can accrue from building
agriculture innovation systems. These include the Ô¨Çow
of rural human capital as a result of increased rural
spending on education (accruing from agricultural
surpluses), the release of rural labour for industrial
employment and enhanced foreign exchange earnings
and increase in domestic savings, all of which are
needed to enable the structural transformation of
African economies.88

AGRICULTURE
AND NATIONAL
FOOD SECURITY

36

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2010

3.1 THE DETERMINANTS OF
NATIONAL FOOD SECURITY
Before discussing agricultural technologies and
innovations, it is necessary to understand the context
within which they are used. The goal for those
seeking to develop and deploy these technologies
and innovations in farm management is to unlock the
productivity growth potential and achieve sustainable
food security.
In many African countries, food security remains of
great concern. The prices of staple foods remain
high ‚Äì above their long-term averages ‚Äì and over
300 million Africans continue to face chronic hunger.
Ensuring food security in the region will require action
to improve productivity and rural livelihoods, and to
address international market imbalances and the
structural challenges inherent in African agriculture.89
This chapter argues that efforts to improve food security
involve much more than just producing more food. It
shows this by discussing the concept of food security
and outlining important factors that determine it. The
overall aim in tackling problems of food security is to
deploy a mix of policies that increase the availability of
food, ensure that consumers have improved access
to food and address any upcoming challenges and
opportunities to achieving food security.
Food security stands crucially on two pillars: food
availability and access to food.90
1. Availability of food is determined by domestic
production, import capacity, existence of food
stocks and the food distribution systems.
2. Access to food depends on households‚Äô levels
of poverty and purchasing power, the state of
the transport and market infrastructure, food
distribution system and, of course, prices.
Food availability can be deemed adequate when
sufÔ¨Åcient quantities of appropriate, necessary types
of food are consistently available (or are within
reasonable proximity) to an individual. Food access
can be considered sufÔ¨Åcient when an individual has
adequate income or other resources to purchase or
barter to obtain levels of appropriate foods needed
to maintain consumption of an adequate nutrition
level. The constraints to availability and access are
diverse. For example constraints to availability include
inappropriate agricultural knowledge, technologies,
and practices, inappropriate economic policies

including pricing, marketing, tax and tariff policies, lack
of foreign exchange, inadequate agricultural inputs, a
non-existent or ineffective private sector, population
growth rates that offset increased production or
imports, marketing and transportation systems
which inhibit the cost-effective movement of food
from source to need, inability to predict, assess and
cope with emergency situations which interrupt food
supplies, natural resource, climatic, and (especially
in Africa) disease constraints and conÔ¨Çicting political
priorities. Constraints to an individual‚Äôs ability to
access food can include economic growth that is
inadequate or insufÔ¨Åciently broad-based (leading
to a lack of job opportunities or lack of incentives to
become a productive participant in the economy),
negative impacts of national economic policies,
inadequate training and/or job skills, lack of credit or
other means to exchange assets or income streams,
food losses associated with ineffective and inefÔ¨Åcient
harvesting, storage, processing and handling, and
political decisions favouring one group over another.
Food security is an evolving concept (see Table 4).
Since the world food crisis of 1974, the idea of economic
access has gained ever-increasing prominence in the
deÔ¨Ånition of food security, to the point that today, any
approach to improving food security must go beyond
farming practices to include rural development and
the expansion of economic opportunities through
income generation infrastructure and marketing.91
This broader approach points to the need to focus
on both technology-based research and innovation in
policy processes.
To have a positive impact on food security, the
application of modern agricultural technologies
must simultaneously contribute to food availability
and to enhancing the poor‚Äôs access to food. Since
food availability is a necessary but not a sufÔ¨Åcient
condition for attaining food security, relevant policy
recommendations on food and livelihood security
must be based on an understanding of the following
types of issues: status of aggregate food supply,
real food prices and real incomes, formal safety nets
intended to protect the poor, how people respond
to drops in real income, the response of national
and local governments to changes at the household
level, and networks and models of collaboration
among national and municipal governments, local
organizations and local communities in response to
food security concerns.93

Table 4. The evolving deÔ¨Ånition of food security91
Period

Changing perceptions of food security

1974

In the 1974 food crisis, food security was deÔ¨Åned by
the World Food Conference as ‚ÄúAvailability at all times of
adequate world food supplies of basic foodstuffs to sustain
a steady expansion of food consumption and to offset
Ô¨Çuctuations in production and prices.‚Äù The deÔ¨Ånition
reÔ¨Çects the global concerns in 1974 on the volume and
stability of food supplies

1983

The FAO deÔ¨Åned food security as ‚ÄúEnsuring that all
people at all times have both physical and economic
access to the basic food that they need.‚Äù This new
concept includes securing access by vulnerable people
to available supplies, calling attention to the balance
between the demand and supply sides of the food
security equation.

1996

In the FAO World Food Summit, the deÔ¨Ånition changed
to ‚ÄúFood security, at the individual, household, national,
regional and global levels (is achieved) when all people, at
all times, have physical and economic access to sufÔ¨Åcient,
safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and
food preferences for an active and healthy life.‚Äù

2001

In the FAO‚Äôs ‚ÄòThe State of Food Insecurity‚Äô, the food
security deÔ¨Ånition was expanded again to include the
notion of social access to food: ‚ÄúA situation that exists
when all people at all times have physical, social and
economic access to sufÔ¨Åcient, safe and nutritious food
that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an
active and healthy life.‚Äù

Future

It may become necessary to integrate additional factors
such as climate change into the concept of food security.

In addition to addressing these broader development
issues, technologies and innovations to improve the
availability of food will need to improve the sources of
food supply, including the following options:
‚Ä¢ increasing domestic production;
‚Ä¢ maintaining appropriate levels of food stocks;
‚Ä¢ understanding the impacts of climate change and
man-made change on soils in order to design
effective adaptation strategies;
‚Ä¢ ensuring the availability of suitable agriculture
land;
‚Ä¢ exploiting the
production;

best

choice

for

37

biofuels

‚Ä¢ feeding livestock;
‚Ä¢ managing cropping intensity;
‚Ä¢ investing in irrigation; and
‚Ä¢ ensuring a constructive role for agricultural
trade.
Before brieÔ¨Çy assessing these determinants of
food supply, it is important to develop a keener
understanding of how Africa procures its food.

World cereal production fell by 3.6 per cent in 2005
and 6.9 per cent in 2006, with an increase of 4.7
per cent in 2007.94 In South Asia, the one per cent
increase in rice and wheat production during 20032008 could not keep pace with the 2.3 per cent growth
in consumption over the same period.95 While cereals
do make up a signiÔ¨Åcant part of the diet in Africa,
roots and tubers are also important staples. Cassava,
potato, yam and sweet potato, as well as starchy fruit
(plantain) are among the major food crops in Africa.
Indeed, cassava is gradually being transformed from
a famine-reserve commodity and rural food staple to a
cash crop for urban consumption.96 Increased growth
in food demand for all roots and tubers is expected in
sub-Saharan Africa.
The following is a brief assessment of the status of each
source of food availability (domestic production, food
stocks and imports), from a food security perspective.

3.2.1 Africa‚Äôs food sources
Food staples such as maize, cassava, sorghum, millet,
wheat, rice, plantain and yams make up 80 per cent of
the daily calories consumed in Africa. While the bulk of
Africa‚Äôs food is consumed and produced locally (e.g.
rice 90 per cent, wheat and maize 75 per cent), some
foods are more likely to be consumed locally than
others. Figure 5 compares Africa‚Äôs sources of food in
1973 to those in 2006 and shows that while cassava,
sorghum and millet consumption has largely been
satisÔ¨Åed by local production, wheat imports rose from
41 per cent to 58 per cent of African consumption in
that period, maize imports increased from 3 per cent
to 19 per cent and rice imports went up from 20 per
cent to 39 per cent of total usage. In fact, most of the
rise in wheat and rice consumption in Africa was met
by increased imports.97 In Cameroon for example,
since the 1970s external rice purchases and the
development of rice production have been inÔ¨Çuenced
by changes in prices and customs regulations. The rice
market grew from 15,000 tons to 60,000 tons between
1975 and 1980. Since then the progression in imports
can be explained by the economic crisis coupled with
growing urbanization ‚Äì two factors which have had a
signiÔ¨Åcant impact on eating habits and farming in the
country. The drop in national rice production has been
accompanied by an increase in imports, and in 2007
Cameroon imported 429,864 tons of rice.98

Yet the role of the ‚Äòworld market‚Äô in providing Africa‚Äôs
food may be overstated.99 Smallholder farmers
produce most of the continent‚Äôs food, with minimal
resources and government support (and typically low
yields). Despite this institutional neglect, ecological
farming systems have been sprouting up across Africa
for decades ‚Äì systems based on farmers‚Äô knowledge,
which not only raise yields but also reduce costs by
using less water and fewer chemicals.100 These are
important reasons to focus on the plight of smallholder farmers as part of a strategy to structurally
improve domestic food production, especially in subSaharan Africa and in parts of Asia.

3.2.2 Food stocks and imports
Globally, cereal stocks are dangerously low, with the
ratio of stocks to utilization only 18.7 per cent in 2007‚Äì
08, the lowest in three decades.102 Grain merchants
usually maintain strategic reserves from previous
harvests to release into country-wide grain markets
when a new ‚Äòlean period‚Äô approaches, to send
prices down. However a combination of drastically
decreased yields (with the 2007 harvest up to 50 per
cent smaller than in previous years), locust invasions
and unusually brief rains has resulted in low stocks
and high prices that are cutting into the reserves.103
In Nigeria for example, the 2008 grain harvest was

double that of 2007, yet the country‚Äôs grain stocks are
running low, causing cereal prices to rise. This can be
explained in part by the fact that the 2007 yield lasted
just three months and farmers therefore did not have
any surplus grains to sell. It is a similar picture across
much of West Africa ‚Äì despite above ‚Äì average cereal
production during the 2007/08 agricultural season,
localized production deÔ¨Åcits are leading to early
increases in food insecurity.
If food stocks continue to decline, West Africa and
other sub-Saharan African countries will need to turn
to imports to make up this shortfall. The net cereal
imports of developing countries jumped from 39
million tons a year in the mid 1970s to 103 million tons
in 1997‚Äì99 and it is feared this Ô¨Ågure will be as high as
265 million tons by 2030, as their own food production
will be able to meet just 86 per cent of their needs. The
food surplus countries of Australia, North America,
Argentina, Uruguay, and the EU are expected to be
the major exporters Ô¨Ålling the gap.
Furthermore, the price of imported food has been on
the rise, drawing down net food importers‚Äô foreign
exchange reserves. For instance, the price of Thai
export grade rice was $362 per ton in December 2007
but almost tripled to $1000 per ton in April 2008.104
Price hikes such as this resulted in developing
countries spending $343 billion on food imports

CHAPTER III : AGRICULTURE AND NATIONAL FOOD SECURITY

in 2008, up a record 35 per cent from 2007.105 Not
unexpectedly, developing countries suffered income
losses as a result.
Given the massive depletion of food stocks and the
heavy Ô¨Åscal burden of costly food imports that has
been exacerbated by the recent food crisis, developing
countries will have to intensify their own efforts to
boost domestic food production in order to safeguard
their food security. National food production can be
increased in four main ways: (a) expanding arable
land; (b) achieving higher levels of cropping intensity
(the frequency with which cropland is cultivated); (c)
increasing yields; and (d) agricultural reforms.
In regions where further expansions in arable land
are not expected, increasing the frequency with
which existing cropland is cultivated ‚Äì particularly
through an expansion in irrigation ‚Äì could be vital for
increasing national food availability. It is the degree
of utilization that determines the effective amount of
land resource available. The 885 million hectares of
currently available arable land in developing countries
is as good as 1770 million hectares, for instance, if it
is used twice a year (that is, with a cropping intensity
index of 200). The current cropping intensity index of
127 on irrigated land is projected to increase steadily
to 138 in 2015 and then remain at a similar level until
2030.106
Only one-Ô¨Åfth of developing countries‚Äô arable land
was under irrigation in 1997‚Äì1999 and there has been
no major increase since then. However, because of
higher yields and more frequent crops, this irrigated
land accounted for two-Ô¨Åfths of all crop production
and close to three-Ô¨Åfths of cereal production in the
1997‚Äì1999 time period. There are, nonetheless, wide
regional variations in the share of irrigated land, with
a meagre two per cent of arable land in sub-Saharan
Africa irrigated in 1997‚Äì99, compared to 40 per cent
in South Asia.107
Solutions to water management include options to
invest in irrigation and other water infrastructure,
to invest primarily in water conservation and better
water management with existing infrastructure, or
some combination of the two. For example, Senegal
has seen its state of food security deteriorate as its
population has risen rapidly since independence.
Even when regular droughts interrupted its food
production, including rainfed rice, too little focus was
put on irrigated rice production. Instead agricultural
policies have long focused on the production of cash

39

crops such as groundnuts. In a recent turnaround, the
government has intensiÔ¨Åed its programmes to raise
food production with a focus on rice production along
the River Senegal. According to the latest production
rates the 2009 rice harvest in the River Senegal valley
alone totalled 350,000 tons paddy rice, equalling some
220,000 tons white rice. This is a sharp increase from
the 100,000 tons harvested in 2008. The increased
production is attributed to infrastructure and irrigation
programmes. The government estimates that rice
production will increase to 1.25 million tons of
paddy rice by 2012 which would be the Ô¨Årst year of
self-sufÔ¨Åciency in rice in Senegal‚Äôs modern history.
There are numerous other examples of increased
rice production across Africa. For example in Guinea
a new type of rice (known as New Rice for Africa, or
Nerica) has quickly superseded other varieties. And
since the launch of Uganda‚Äôs Upland Rice Project in
2004, the National Agricultural Research Organization
reports an almost nine-fold increase in the number of
rice farmers from 4,000 in 2004 to over 35,000 in 2007.
At the same time Uganda‚Äôs rice imports dropped from
60,000 tons in 2005 to 35,000 in 2007, saving roughly
$30 million in the process.

3.3 NEW DETERMINANTS OF
FOOD SECURITY
Currently, the determinants that are at the core of
achieving food security are issues related to access
to credit, infrastructure, access to markets and land
ownership. These are critical processes that need to
be put in place before contemplating a Green, Rainbow
or any other revolution in agriculture. In addition there
are new factors that will have an increasing impact
on food security. These include the choices that are
being made on the production of biofuels, the feeding
of animals, the availability and efÔ¨Åcient use of irrigation
water, the manner in which arable land is utilized and
the technologies to increase productivity and generate
income.

3.3.1 Soil degradation and climate
change
Climate change and desertiÔ¨Åcation put the food
security of one billion poor people at risk.108 Persistent
problems in the drylands of Asia and sub-Saharan
Africa such as land degradation, biodiversity loss, and
water and fossil fuel shortages, will be exacerbated
by climate change and desertiÔ¨Åcation. Facing these

40

climate uncertainties head-on is the only way to
enhance the resilience of dryland communities.109
The drylands climate adaptation work that has so
far been undertaken by ICRISAT and others has
increased farmers‚Äô productivity by as much as fourfold and proÔ¨Åts by three-fold, through the use of
climate variability analysis and management options
including the use of water-efÔ¨Åcient crops. For example,
pigeonpea hybrids developed at ICRISAT have shown
a 30 to 150 per cent yield advantage and increased
drought resistance by producing between 30 and 40
per cent more root mass. Unless the livelihoods and
resource base of other vulnerable rural communities
can be made similarly resilient, coping with climate
change and desertiÔ¨Åcation may be next to impossible
for poor dryland farming communities. Only such
science-based interventions will make farmers who
depend on drylands less vulnerable in the future.110

3.3.2 Biofuels and food security
Given the limits reached in arable land utilization
in some regions and the expected impacts of
climate change on soil quality and land availability,
improvements in food availability may be better served
by using existing arable land for food crops for human
consumption rather than diverting such land to the
production of biofuels and animal feed.
In 2007‚Äì08, 100 million tons of grain was diverted to the
production of biofuels (maize/corn utilized for ethanol
and oilseeds for biodiesel production).111 Four-Ô¨Åfths of
the total diverted was produced in the United States.
This boom in corn ethanol production has pushed
corn prices to more than $15 per bushel, up from just
$2 per bushel in 2006.112 The spike in grain prices is
partly due to policy choices on biofuels. The United
States government passed the Energy Independence
and Security Act in December 2007, which raised the
mandated volume of renewable fuels (mostly cornbased ethanol) for 2008 from 5.4 billion to 9 billion
gallons, a huge increase over a short time. Since then,
the price of corn rose by about 50 per cent.
A bushel of corn yields 2.8 gallons of ethanol and in
order to meet the congressional mandates, more than
a quarter of United States corn crop must be diverted
to ethanol production. This has effectively removed
a quarter of United States corn production from the
world cereal marketplace. The United States is, by
far, the largest source of this commodity and the corn
price increases have spilled over to wheat and other

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2010

crops that can substitute for corn.113
IFPRI estimates that 30 per cent of the increase in the
prices of major grains is due to biofuels. Unpublished
Ô¨Ågures from the World Bank indicate that biofuels have
forced global food prices upwards by 75 per cent,
sharply contradicting the contention of the United
States government that biofuels contribute less than
3 per cent to food price hikes.114
Using existing biofuel technologies, the conversion
of a quarter of the world‚Äôs major cereal and sugar
crops (wheat, rice, maize, sorghum, sugarcane,
cassava and sugar beet) into ethanol could replace a
meagre 14 per cent of the world‚Äôs petrol consumption.
Hypothetically speaking, if the planet‚Äôs total available
food supplies are converted into ethanol, the volume
of fuel generated would not meet even 60 per cent of
the current level of global petrol consumption (1,100
billion litres in 2003).115
In the Philippines, preliminary research on the impacts
of the country‚Äôs Biofuels Program has shown mixed
outcomes (see Box 4). The programme involves Ô¨Åve
feedstocks ‚Äì coconut and jatropha for biodiesel,
and cassava, sugarcane and sweet sorghum for
bio-ethanol. Coconut and sugarcane are among the
country‚Äôs major export crops and cassava is primarily
a food crop with more than 80 per cent of the two
million metric tons average annual production normally
processed into various food items. The case suggests
an unavoidable competition between food production
and biofuels production for available feedstock, with
the exception of jatropha.116
In 2009, the government of Mozambique adopted a
National Policy and Strategy for Biofuels, establishing
guidelines for both the public and private sector to
better participate in the biofuel industry. Concerns over
food security issues were discussed in parliament and
the government pledged to produce biofuels without
compromising food production. The objective for the
policy measure according to the government is to
reduce the country‚Äôs dependence on imported fossil
fuels. Other factors, such as the need to ensure energy
security, advantageous conditions for agriculture, and
the need to promote sustainable economic growth,
were also cited as motivating factors.117 In an effort
to promote the development of biofuel production,
Mozambique has engaged with governments and
businesses in other countries (including biofuels
giant Brazil) and has concluded agreements on trade
cooperation, investment, and technology transfer,

CHAPTER III : AGRICULTURE AND NATIONAL FOOD SECURITY

giving the country an advantage over other African
countries, such as Angola, which have also shown an
interest in biofuel production.

3.3.3 Feeding livestock
The diversion of cereals from human consumption to
animal feed has increased from a Ô¨Åfth of developing
countries‚Äô cereal output in the 1979‚Äì81 period to
nearly a third of their cereal output 20 years later.
Such diversion is projected to climb to almost 40 per
cent of total cereal production in 2015 and one-half
of the entire cereal output by 2030.118 Some question
the rationale for the conversion of grain into meat to
fulÔ¨Ål the human nutritional requirement, pointing out
that 5kg of cereals are needed to produce just 1kg of
meat.119 With regards to Africa, this trend could affect
the quantities and price of cereal imports.
Many feedstuffs are available to livestock producers,
including crop residues, processing co-products and
new or alternative grains and forages, as well as more
traditional grains and forages.120

3.3.4 Migration and rural development
The difÔ¨Åculties of making a living in the rural areas
of developing countries have resulted in internal
migration to the cities and to neighbouring countries
as well as overseas, as can be observed in many
African countries. This is particularly true for West
African countries where agriculture has deteriorated

41

considerably, an example being the cotton farming
sector in Mali. Examples have shown that when
agriculture is doing well, migration is reduced and in
some cases is even reverted, as has been the case
in Brazil. The northeast of Brazil, the poorest area
of the country, is characterized by a semi-arid agroecological system. The difÔ¨Åculties for the agricultural
sector resulted in a massive rural exodus towards
southern, more developed regions of the country over
the last decades. However, there was a reversal in the
last decade with the implementation of an agri-export
fruit sector in the valley of S√£o Francisco River. A welldeveloped package of tropical technologies for the
fruit sector is transforming the region, turning it into a
major exporter of fruit to Europe, other South American
countries, Japan and the United States. Many of those
who migrated south particularly to Rio de Janeiro and
S√£o Paulo are now returning to their native regions to
work on farms or take up jobs in the tourism and fruit
sectors.
The government has played a key role in this
process by ensuring that economic stability and
social programmes such as the National Programme
for Family Agriculture (PRONAF) are efÔ¨Åciently
implemented in order to boost the modernization of
small-scale farming. Brazil provides a valuable model
of how to succeed in integrating small-scale farming
into agri-export business without incurring huge
losses.

Box 4: Impacts of the Philippines Biofuels Program121
The Philippines Biofuels Program has been promoted not only as a way to deal with mounting energy prices but also as a
means of providing alternative income generating opportunities for rural households. A 2007 study looked at the impact of
the programme on food security and focused particularly on two feedstocks: sugarcane and coconut. The initial results of
a modelling exercise produced the following Ô¨Åndings:
a. Gross value-added in agriculture: As a whole, the modelling results point to relatively large increases in the valueadded of the agriculture sector. As expected, value-added in food processing declines, but by a lower amount compared to the increase in the sectors producing feedstock.
b. Employment: Total employment in agriculture also expands, and the increase comes primarily from the sugar and
coconut production.
c. Food crops output: There is a perceptible decline in the value-added of rice and corn. This suggests that, due to the
change in relative prices, variable inputs tend to move towards the production of biofuel feedstock. Large increases
are expected in the price of sugar and coconut.
d. Household income: The results suggest that household income tends to increase.
e. ProÔ¨Åts: ProÔ¨Åtability of jatropha production is comparable to rice and corn. If, as claimed by those promoting jatropha,
the crop does not displace others currently in the cropping system, it will bring about net economic beneÔ¨Åts to rural
areas. Farm operators will earn $115 per hectare per year on the third year, and additional employment equivalent to
40 man-days per hectare will be generated.

42

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2010

The experiences of Brazil in reverting migratory Ô¨Çux
can provide valuable lessons for Africa. A number of
factors are contributing to migration in Africa aside
from under-developed agriculture. The economic
meltdown, subsidies for agriculture in the developed
world, climate change and political instability are
but some of the elements that pose challenges for
the future. On the other hand, remittances represent
a positive contribution to agricultural and rural
development, particularly in West Africa where a large
proportion of migrants have direct or indirect links with
the rural sector.

3.4 THE ROLE OF AGRICULTURAL
TRADE IN FOOD SECURITY
3.4.1 Africa‚Äôs agricultural trade deÔ¨Åcit
and policy linkages
The continent maintained a positive agricultural trade
balance through the 1960s and 1970s, but saw a
sudden and dramatic shift in the early 1980s (see
Figure 6). A sharp decline in agricultural exports
caused the deÔ¨Åcit, which stood at $4.7 billion in 1997.
Structural adjustment policies and restricted market
access, coupled with the escalation of domestic and
export subsidies in developed countries (leading to
depressed world prices) contributed to deteriorating
terms of trade and to a persistent trade deÔ¨Åcit.

Research and analysis should propose opportunities
for investment by identifying the affected populations,
the food crops with large trade deÔ¨Åcits, and the
role that speciÔ¨Åc crops have in enhancing food and
livelihood security.

3.4.2 Trade and agriculture policy
linkages
Trade policy linkages are paramount in determining
the supply, accessibility and nutritional stability of food.
Promoting food security in trade policy formulation
and negotiations entails addressing issues related to
availability, accessibility or affordability, and stability of
food prices. This debate is even more critical to net
food-importing countries.
Policy oriented research is needed to deÔ¨Åne the
speciÔ¨Åc situations facing small and vulnerable
economies (SVEs), landlocked countries and least
developed countries (LDCs). Such research must go
beyond merely noting how such countries might be
affected by further trade liberalization and must also
probe how they can improve their overall productivity
and competitiveness.
The current realities of global trade, the declining value
of the dollar, and rising food prices has encouraged
some countries to take short-term trade policy
responses, including controversial measures such
as export taxes and restrictions, as well as consumer
subsidies.

CHAPTER III : AGRICULTURE AND NATIONAL FOOD SECURITY

3.4.3 Trade policy in the wake of the
food crisis
Since the intensiÔ¨Åcation of food price hikes, African
policy-makers have been considering ways to make
food more affordable for vulnerable populations. A
number of countries realize that, besides the goal
of food security, food sovereignty is also worth
considering, in light of the risks associated with overreliance on unstable global markets. The measures
taken by different countries range from food subsidies
for consumers to incentives for farmers to increase
production. For example Nigeria, Burkina Faso and
Ethiopia lowered prices by releasing emergency
grain reserves onto the market. Senegal and Ethiopia
dropped tariffs on food imports and introduced food
subsidies. Ethiopia banned the export of its cereals
and added a ten per cent surtax on luxury imports to
fund wheat subsidies for the poor.
Some are of the view that African countries may stand
to gain from the food crisis. Among them the president
of Uganda has argued that, overall, the crisis is good
news for some farmers in Uganda. Over the years
the country has increased its production of maize,
bananas, potatoes, sweet potatoes, cassava, rice,
wheat, and animal products such as milk, beef, etc.
In addition, while much of the food crisis discussion is
dominated by grains and other internationally traded
commodities, it should be realized that roots and
tubers form an important part of the diet in Africa and
these crops have been relatively untouched by the
crisis. Indeed, investing in the production of root and
tuber crops can help provide a buffer and avert future
food crises in sub Saharan Africa.
An appropriate trade policy response to the food crisis
would need to incorporate a coherent approach to
biofuel production, adaptation to climate change and
mitigation, measures to ensure that price increases
actually beneÔ¨Åt small-holder farmers, and measures
to enhance productivity and competitiveness in
developing countries (potentially including, but not
limited to, the existing ‚Äòaid for trade‚Äô mechanism
under discussion at the WTO). The ongoing Doha
Round negotiations on issues such as new food aid
disciplines are also relevant.

3.5 SUMMARY
Achieving food security means much more than simply
producing more food. Without policies to improve poor

43

consumers‚Äô access to food, policies that increase the
availability of food only will not ensure national food
security.
In Africa, improving the availability of and access
to food demands strengthening local productivity
and production. This is because, in Africa and other
developing country regions, the vast bulk of food is
produced and consumed locally. A lesson from the
recent food crisis is that as food import prices rise
and global stocks drop, the need to improve local
production becomes more acute.
There are four main ways to improve local food
production:
(a) expanding arable land;
(b) achieving higher levels of cropping intensity;
(c) increasing yields; and
(d) implementing agricultural policy reforms.
Increases in cropping intensity are, however, strongly
dependent on increasing the availability of irrigation.
Yet the gains made through such strategies remain
vulnerable to a variety of new challenges, particularly
soil degradation due, among other factors, to climate
change. DesertiÔ¨Åcation is estimated to put the food
security of one billion poor people at risk, particularly
in dryland areas of Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.
Other important risks include the hollowing out of
potentially productive rural communities caused
by mass migration to the cities. While the explosive
transfer of population from rural to urban settings
can weaken the productive capacity of vulnerable
agricultural sectors, experience suggests such trends
can be slowed and even reversed by well designed
policy interventions to improve the attractiveness of
agriculture and rural livelihoods.
The failure of developed countries to recognize
the negative impacts of their policy actions on food
production and demand in the developing countries
has in some instances resulted in suboptimal policy
choices. To preserve policy coherence, renewed
attention to agriculture must go hand-in-hand with
the removal of farm and export subsidies for key
commodities (cereals) in developed countries, to
avoid depressing the prices that small-holder farmers
receive in developing nations.

44

Competition for the use of land from biofuels poses
yet another new risk for food security, as acreage that
might have been devoted to producing food for human
consumption is diverted to the production of biofuel
feedstocks. Evidence is mounting that competition
over the use of land from biofuels has contributed
strongly to the current food crisis. Competition for land
to raise livestock and produce animal feed similarly
tends to decrease the amount of food available locally
for food consumers.

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2010

This chapter has established the evolving nature of
food security and how it goes beyond increasing
production and relates to other policy areas. The next
chapter discusses the challenges to achieving this in
Africa, and explains why the call that is sometimes
made for Africans to reproduce the Asian Green
Revolution in their continent will not provide a solution
to the need for rapid African agricultural development.
It argues that any ‚Äòrevolution‚Äô in African agriculture
must be fundamentally different in nature.

AGRICULTURE AND
DEVELOPMENT:
REGIONAL COMPARISONS

Solving problems of agricultural production and
access to food requires an assessment and
identiÔ¨Åcation of where additional investment dollars
are most likely to have the strongest impacts. This
chapter therefore draws some lessons and caveats
from the Green Revolution. Some of the most
important lessons learned relate to tenancy rights, the
role of public institutions, the equitable distribution of
resources, the investment gap in agriculture and the
role of development assistance. Brief case studies
on India and Brazil and a comparison of productivity
gains in Asia, Latin America and Africa are provided
to draw lessons for a strategy for African agricultural
development.
Africa‚Äôs development is, to a large extent, reliant on its
progress in the agricultural sector. This is particularly
the case in sub-Saharan Africa, where over 80 per
cent of the poorest people live in rural areas and some
300 million people are undernourished.

Small-scale farming in this part of the continent
accounts for nearly 96 per cent of the total farming
community and the majority of the small-scale farmers
and rural workers are women struggling to improve
living conditions in fragile and low-proÔ¨Åt, semi- or full
subsistence farming systems. African agriculture, for
many reasons which will be examined in this report,
has not taken part in the Green Revolution that so vastly
improved life in Asian and Latin American countries
in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The resulting gap
between Africa on the one hand, and Asia and Latin
America on the other is summarized in Table 5 below.
It could be argued that coming late to the Green
Revolution has created a unique opportunity for
Africa, as the continent has the chance to learn from
the experiences of other parts of the world in adopting
particular agricultural packages. There is now a better
understanding of the conditions under which the Green
Revolution and similar yield-enhancing technologies
are likely to have equitable beneÔ¨Åts among farmers.
These conditions include a scale-neutral technology
package that can be proÔ¨Åtably adopted on farms of
all sizes, an equitable distribution of land with secure
ownership or tenancy rights, efÔ¨Åcient input, credit,
and product markets so that farms of all sizes have
access to modern farm inputs and information and
are able to receive similar prices for their products,
and, Ô¨Ånally, policies that do not discriminate against
small farms and landless labourers (such as subsidies
on mechanization and scale biases in agricultural
research and extension).123

4.1.1 Growing food demand and
shrinking supply of arable land
Since the 1970s, the population in sub-Saharan Africa
has been growing faster than in any other region
in the world, placing ever greater strains on food
security and forcing farmers to intensify production
beyond the point of environmental sustainability. With
the population of sub-Saharan Africa expected to
increase by nearly 400 million by 2025, the question
being asked is: What technologies are most capable
of meeting this increasing demand for food? Figure 7
shows that, since the late 1970s, cereal production
has consistently failed to keep pace with population
growth in Africa.

The issue of diminishing supply of arable land is an
important one for Africa, especially as the continent
could lose 247 million acres of farmland by 2050 due
to climate change.125 Small changes in temperature
can cause a signiÔ¨Åcant reduction in production. The
National Academy of Sciences in the United States
estimates that for every one degree Celsius increase,
wheat, rice, and corn yields decline by 10 per cent.
This will signiÔ¨Åcantly reduce the global production of
grains and put pressure on the supply and demand of
farmland globally.
Another factor in the loss of arable land is the increase
in pasture land. Meat consumption in developing
countries is almost double that of developed countries.
Increase in animal stock means additional land for
grazing of farm animals.
All these factors have contributed to a downward
trend in productivity. This is illustrated by Ô¨Ågures
showing that domestic production could meet 90 per
cent of the demand for food in developing countries in
the periods 1979‚Äì81 and 1997‚Äì99 but is expected to
meet as little as 86 per cent of demand over the next
two decades.126 While wheat and rice together make
up for over half of the global cereal consumption,
coarse grains (maize, sorghum, barley, rye, oats, and
millet) account for 80 per cent of human consumption
in sub-Saharan Africa.127

4.1.2 The impacts of climate change on
agriculture
Professor Rashid Hassan, co-author of a
comprehensive study covering all the key agroclimatic zones and farming systems in Africa concluded
that: ‚ÄúClimate change is not an academic fallacy, but a
real concern which is affecting the masses, especially
the poorest of the poor who depend on agriculture
for survival. It is a reality that is affecting real lives. It is
imperative to note that this is not an issue that is going
to disappear anytime soon. Information, education and
resources need to be dispersed to the vulnerable laymen
so that they can prepare themselves for its effects. It is
the duty of individuals, governments and authorities to
invest more into research that can help alleviate this
and shed more light on this matter.‚Äù The study report
argues that the highest risk of future climate change
damage is associated with specialized crop and
livestock farming (mono systems) particularly under
dryland conditions in arid and semi-arid regions.128
While most vulnerable developing countries such as
LDCs, SVEs and SIDS represent only a small portion
of world trade, their key production and trade sectors
‚Äì including agriculture ‚Äì will be particularly affected
by climate change impacts such as drought and
Ô¨Çooding. The cumulative impacts of climate change
on agricultural production are likely to translate into
negative spillovers on employment, food production,
food security, and income generation.

4.1.3 Tenancy rights and access to
credit

‚Ä¢ involvement of farmers and their organizations in
land management; and
‚Ä¢ putting in place a law on agricultural land policy
with preferential selection for women, youths and
vulnerable groups.132

Tenancy rights and access to credit go hand-in-hand.
The possession of legal titles was found to lead to
greater credit access for poor farmers in Peru.129 These
relate to investment in agriculture through demand
and supply-side effects. On the demand side, land
tenure security increases farmer demand to improve
the productivity of the land in the medium and long
term. In the presence of credit markets, technologies
and farm inputs, improved tenure security leads to
higher investment.130 The transferability of land rights
also plays an important role. Transferability of land
rights may improve the creditworthiness of the landholder, especially for long-term credit. This enhances
the land‚Äôs collateral value and lenders‚Äô expected
return. In sum, investment may be encouraged by
better land tenure security, the easier convertibility of
land into liquid assets and the emergence of a credit
market.131

4.1.4 The role of public institutions
The Ô¨Årst Green Revolution was introduced with
substantial help from huge state-run support systems.
Governments provided training, credit, research and
extension, marketing, processing and distribution
services to farmers who adopted Green Revolution
technologies. These state subsidies created a
market for private sector entry into the seed, fertilizer,
machinery and trade activities in the Green Revolution.
Few of these services are available today.133
Only a Ô¨Åfth of the rural population in sub-Saharan
Africa has easy access to markets, compared to 60
per cent of Asian rural dwellers (as shown in Figure 8),
making fertilizer procurement costs exorbitant for the
former while facilitating the rapid spread of the Green
Revolution in the agricultural Ô¨Åelds of the latter. This
is dramatically demonstrated by Ô¨Ågures showing the
impact of timely investments in rural roads by India,
which contributed 25 per cent of the growth in its
agricultural output in the 1970s.134

The government of Mali considers land tenure as one
of the crucial issues that is slowing down the country‚Äôs
agricultural development. The Agricultural Guidelines
Law that was passed in 2006 aims to provide land
tenure security through:
‚Ä¢ equitable and easy access to land resources,
particularly for women, youths and vulnerable
groups;
‚Ä¢ recognition of customs and habits;
‚Ä¢ the creation of local land commissions;
‚Ä¢ the introduction of a land register at commune
level;

It should also be noted that the market and the private
sector are increasingly driving agriculture productivity
and income generation. This evolving reality must be
harnessed to the beneÔ¨Åt of small-farmers in developing
countries.

Box 5: Where best to invest: the case of India137
In the case of India, the three government expenditures found to be most effective in increasing agriculture production and
alleviating rural poverty are:
1. Government expenditure on roads: An additional Rs100 billion invested in roads would increase productivity growth by more
than 3 per cent. Road building has the largest positive impact on rural poverty, increased non-agricultural employment
opportunities and wages. Of the total productivity effect on poverty, 75 per cent arises from the direct impact of roads on
incomes, while the remaining 25 per cent arises from lower agricultural prices and increased wages.
2. Government investment in research and extension has the second largest impact on rural poverty, but the largest impact of
any investment on productivity growth. Another Rs100 billion of investment in R&D would increase productivity growth by
about 7 per cent and reduce the incidence of rural poverty by about 0.5 per cent. R&D has a smaller impact on poverty
than roads because it only affects poverty through improved productivity, and India has not targeted R&D speciÔ¨Åcally to
improve the lot of the poor.
3. Third ranked is government spending on education. An additional Rs1 million spent on education would raise 32 poor people
above the poverty line, mostly by increasing non-farm employment opportunities and wages. However education, at least
as measured here by a simple literacy ratio, has only a modest impact on agricultural growth.
Government expenditures on rural development, irrigation and power make up the rest of the list. It needs to be borne in
mind that irrigation and power are more readily available in India compared to sub-Saharan Africa.
In conclusion, in order to reduce rural poverty and stimulate growth in agricultural productivity increased spending on rural
roads, agricultural research and extension and education are needed to complement investments in agricultural inputs
such as fertilizers, seeds and irrigation.

4.1.5 The investment gap in agriculture
Deploying technology and innovation to increase
agricultural productivity will require increased
investment in agricultural research and advisory
services. A study by IFPRI calculated the public
investment requirements that sub-Saharan Africa
will need to invest in order to meet MDG1 (including
investments in agricultural administration, research
and extension, irrigation, and small rural infrastructure
such as unpaved feeder roads). Table 6 summarizes
the results of this study and shows that the investment
gap is widest in sub-Saharan Africa.
These results suggest that SSA countries will need
to boost their annual agricultural growth to 7.5 per
cent per year in order to achieve MDG1. If SSA
countries fulÔ¨Ål their commitments under the Maputo

Declaration to allocate 10 per cent of their budgets to
agriculture, the MDG1 target would require additional
or incremental spending of $4.8 billion per year.
Yet prospects for additional Ô¨Ånancing have been
curtailed by the world Ô¨Ånancial crisis. For the past
year and a half, the world economy has experienced
a downturn with job losses surging, stock markets
at record low levels and investors around the globe
holding on to their money. As the credit squeeze further
intensiÔ¨Åes there is pressure on governments to cut
budget deÔ¨Åcits. With this, the need to target spending
more efÔ¨Åciently to achieve agricultural growth and
food security is becoming even more important. Box 5
highlights the top three government expenditures for
increasing agricultural production in India.
In sub-Saharan Africa, public spending for farming is
only four per cent of total government spending. In
addition the agriculture sector is taxed at relatively
high levels.138
In the last three decades of the last century, developing
countries consistently underinvested in their innovation
systems. In 2000, overall public research intensity in
developing countries, measured as the percentage
of agricultural GDP invested in public agricultural
research, remained low, at only 0.53 per cent.139

50

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2010

4.1.6 Development assistance
The productivity of African agriculture is also
partially linked to development funding. International
development assistance to agriculture has been
declining (see Figure 9).140 Aid to agriculture, which
typically accounted for close to 20 per cent of bilateral
sector commitments in the 1970s and 1980s had
fallen to 12 per cent in 1993 and 1994. Over the last
15 years, the volume of aid to agriculture in Africa
decreased both in absolute terms (from $2.6 to $2.0
billion), and as a share of total ofÔ¨Åcial development
assistance (from 11 to 5.4 per cent).
Only three per cent of science-, technology- and
innovation-related aid is destined for agricultural
research in least developed countries (many of
which are in Africa). As a result, Africa is one of the
only regions in the world where agricultural research
and development spending has actually declined

since the early 1980s.142 Research and development
must be intensiÔ¨Åed with a focus on increasing crop
tolerance of abiotic stress (such as drought, Ô¨Çooding
and salinity) and resistance to pests and disease.
The shift towards structural adjustment lending that
emphasized economic liberalization led to a sharp
decline in aid to agriculture since the early 1990s. This
decline has been attributed to a number of factors.
For example, some point to the Heavily Indebted Poor
Country (HIPC) Initiative, an agreement among ofÔ¨Åcial
creditors to help the poorest, most heavily indebted
countries escape from unsustainable debt. Due to
sustained political pressure by civil society groups,
the HIPC Initiative to help poor countries move on
to a sustainable faster growth path, focused on the
provision of poverty-reducing spending, such as on
health and education143 .

CHAPTER IV : CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES TO ACHIEVE FOOD SECURITY

The composition of aid has changed over the past three
decades with large shifts in ODA allocations towards
the social sectors (health, education, governance), and
emergency assistance and reconstruction activities.
The share of ODA devoted to the social sector grew
from nearly 13 percent in 1979 to 44 percent of all ODA
in 2007. In contrast, productive sectors (agriculture,
industry, mining,) and economic and infrastructure
sectors (communications, banking, transport, energy)
have experienced declining ODA allocations. Around
58 percent of ODA in 1979, economic and productive
sectors received slightly more than 23 percent of ODA
in 2007.

Table 7. Major pledges to boost food security in Africa (2008/2009)146
World Bank

The World Bank has made an additional $1.2 billion available through its Global Food Crisis Response Program (GFRP). In April 2009, the WB‚Äôs Board of
Directors approved a new ceiling passing to $2 billion. On the immediate to longer-term food challenges, the World Bank Group said it would boost its overall
support for global agriculture and food to $6 billion next year up from $4 billion, and would launch risk management tools, and crop insurance to protect
poor countries and small-holders. In January 2010 the Global Agriculture and Food Security Programme (GASFP) was approved by the World Bank Board of
Directors with donations expected to reach $ 1.5 billion in three years. The United States, Canada and Spain committed money to the mechanism.

EU

The European Union launched a ‚Ç¨1 billion Food Facility in December 2008 to be spent over three years, notably through
food aid, emergency aid and redeployment of funds. This is in addition to ‚Ç¨800 million in 2008 and 2009.

United States

In 2008, the United States announced an additional funding for food aid of about $770 million for Ô¨Åscal year 2009. In
November at the World Summit on Food Security in Rome, the United States announced it would invest $3.5 billion over
three years to spur ‚Äúagricultural growth in a sustainable, environmentally friendly way‚Äù.

FAO Summit

At the FAO High Level Conference on Food Security in 2008, pledges were made by various countries, including France,
$1.5 billion (over Ô¨Åve years); Germany, $750 million; Japan, $150 million; Kuwait, $100 million; the Netherlands, $75
million; New Zealand, $7.5 million; Spain, $773 million; United Kingdom, $590 million; Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,
$100 million. About 22 billion dollars were pledged after the summit.

Madrid Summit

At the Madrid High Level Meeting on Food Security for All held in January 2009 countries supported the need to create a Global
Partnership for Agriculture, Food Security and Nutrition. Spain pledged an additional ‚Ç¨200 million per year for the next Ô¨Åve years.

Japan

Japan announced in 2008 just before the fourth Tokyo International Conference for Africa Development (TICAD) that it
would double its average ODA to Africa over 2003-2007 (excluding debt relief) over the next Ô¨Åve years (2008-2012). In
the agriculture sector, Japan announced it would help African nations double rice production within a decade. This will
be achieved in part by increasing the use of NERICA, or New Rice for Africa. TICAD underscores the importance of SouthSouth cooperation, especially the development of trade and investment between Asia and Africa.

Brazil

At the African Union Summit in July 2009, Brazil signed a complementary cooperation agreement with the AU for the implementation
of projects in the areas of agriculture and livestock. Brazil has established an ofÔ¨Åce of the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation in
Accra, Ghana calling for more involvement of South-South and triangular cooperation for the development of agriculture in the African
continent. The Cotton 4 project has a budget of $4 million, including $3.5 million directly for agricultural projects.

China

China supports many infrastructure and agriculture and rural development projects in Africa. Recently it has announced the establishment
of 14 centres of agricultural research in the continent and over 100 agricultural scientists are working in Africa. China has given important
market access preferences for Africa, and it has become a major source of FDIs and an important creditor and debt relief. China announced
eight new measures during the China-Africa forum in Egypt in November 2009. They included a commitment to enhance cooperation on
science and technology, capacity building, education and training. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, China will increase the number of agricultural technology
demonstration centres in Africa to 20. It will be send 50 agricultural technology teams to Africa and train 2,000 African agricultural
technology personnel to strengthen the continents ability to addressing food security.

India

In April 2008 India convened the First Summit Africa-India signing a cooperation agreement on the agricultural sector. The
meeting also marked the announcement of a zero tariff for 98 per cent of imported products from LDCs including agricultural
products. The next Africa-India Summit will be held in 2011 in Africa. India is the Ô¨Årst developing country to announce the
zero tariffs which is part of the Doha Round Package, agreed in the WTO Hong Kong (China) Ministerial in 2004.

African Agriculture
Fund (AAF)

Established in April 2009, the AAF expects to raise ‚Ç¨200 million during its Ô¨Årst phase and has a Ô¨Ånal target of ‚Ç¨500 million. The Fund
will target private companies and cooperatives that implement strategies to increase and diversify agricultural production in Africa.

Regional Development
Banks

The Asian Development Bank announced $0.5 billion for immediate budgetary support to tackle rising food costs and increased lending
to agriculture by $1.0 billion for 2009. The African Development Bank added $1.0 billion to its agriculture portfolio which totals $4.8
billion now. The Inter-American Bank allocated $1.5 billion to the Jeddah Declaration on Assistance for Least Developed Member
Countries Affected by the Global Food Crisis scheme. IADB also made available a $0.5 billion credit line

United Nations System

IFAD has made $200 million available in its response to rising food and energy prices. FAO presented a $1.7 billion
Initiative on Soaring Food Prices (ISFP) during its High Level Conference on Food Security in June 2008. The WFP received
$960 million as a result of its $755 million appeal to offset its increased costs for food and fuel.

L‚ÄôAquila Initiative on Food Security was launched where $ 20 billion was pledged to address issues of food security and
putting food security, nutrition and sustainable agriculture, nutrition at the core of the international agenda. The negative
impacts of climate change on agriculture and on the availability of water was also recognized.

G20 London

At the G20 Summit in London in April 2009 the United States announced a plan designed, in part, to combat the global
food crisis. The initiative allots $448 million to address immediate aid concerns in Latin America and Africa, and allocates
another $1 billion for the development of a long-term food security strategy. The President announced he intends to double
U.S. assistance for global agricultural productivity and rural development.

Monterrey Consensus

The Monterrey Declaration, the outcome of the Financing for Development conference held in Mexico in 2002, stated that
developed countries that have not done so should make concrete efforts towards the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national
product (GNP) as ODA to developing countries and 0.15 to 0.20 per cent of GNP to least developed countries.

(CFA) as a guide for global and local actors, both institutions and governments, and a catalyst for action that needs to start
now. The CFA provides a brief analysis of the global food crisis and the threats it represents, and outlines opportunities in
several areas to improve global food security and further poverty reduction.

Since the start of the latest food crisis, there have been
increasing calls for a new Green Revolution, particularly
for sub-Saharan Africa. Implicit in these calls is the
recognition that the original Green Revolution in Asia
was largely responsible for the aggregate increase in
the yields of staple food crops in the region.

two to three times more grain than traditional varieties
had been produced. The programme was expanded
in the 1960s, teaching farmers in Pakistan and India to
cultivate the new wheat. Pakistan produced 8.4 million
tons in 1970, up from 4.6 million in 1965 and India‚Äôs
production was 20 million tons in 1970, up from 12.3
million in 1965. The Green Revolution then spilled over
to China in the 1980s. By 1960, wheat yields in Mexico
had already doubled from their 1940 level and have
remained higher than the world average, and far higher
than in Asia or Africa ever since (see Figure 10).

A comparison of African, Asian and Latin American
productivity increases from the 1960s to the 1980s
in wheat, rice and maize suggests that the Green
Revolution in Latin America started earlier than in Asia.
The Latin American Green Revolution started in the
1940s, with a programme funded by the Rockefeller
Foundation aimed at assisting poor farmers in Mexico.
Within two decades, high-yield dwarf wheat that
resisted a variety of pests and diseases and yielded

At the centre of the Green Revolution in Asia was a
speciÔ¨Åc package of technologies ‚Äì new, higher-yielding
varieties of wheat, maize and rice, chemical fertilizers,
and irrigation ‚Äì that was designed to bring about a
rapid increase in productivity of staple crops and help
avert the threat of famine. The innovations developed
changed the traditional methods of work and farming
systems, transforming the socio-economic conditions
of farming communities.

CHAPTER IV : CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES TO ACHIEVE FOOD SECURITY

4.2.2 Regional differences and unequal
productivity
Alarmingly, annual growth in crop yields has been
declining globally from two per cent during 197090 to only one per cent during 1990‚Äì2007, with
bleak prospects of any improvement in the future.
Rice scientists and policy-makers are becoming
concerned about the fact that rice yields seem to
be levelling off in Asia. It may well be that the Green
Revolution technologies are now almost exhausted
of any further productivity gains. Among the reasons
for this decline in Asia‚Äôs rice production increases are
long-term degradation of the paddy resource base
and the shrinking of rice lands under pressure from
industrialization.151 Scientists attribute the net drop
in Asia‚Äôs total irrigated area to soil salinization and
water logging associated with intensive rice cropping.
This is expected to get worse due to the decline in
quantity and quality of water available for rice growing.
Furthermore, water and wind erosion are estimated to
affect some 400 million ha of the region‚Äôs farmland,
while another 47 million ha are subject to chemical
and physical degradation.

many non-poor people avoid the poverty and hunger
they would have experienced had the Green Revolution
not occurred. The largest beneÔ¨Åts to the poor were
indirect, in the form of lower food prices, increased
migration opportunities, and greater employment
in the rural non-farm economy. The direct beneÔ¨Åts
to the poor through their own on-farm adoption,
greater agricultural employment, and empowerment
have been more mixed and depend heavily on local
socioeconomic conditions. In many cases inequalities
between regions and communities that adopted Green
Revolution technologies and those that did not also
worsened. At the same time, the Green Revolution had
many negative environmental impacts that have still to
be adequately redressed.‚Äù 153
While the Green Revolution was successful in
increasing the yield of rice, wheat and maize it did
have some serious shortcomings. For example, it did
not address the issue of malnutrition, or the negative
impacts it had on the environment as high levels of
fertilizer inputs for rice affected the structure of the soil
and the ecosystem.

Others however warn that some temporary decreases
in yield have been confused with yield decline. For
example, in central China lower yields were found to
be caused by unsuitable varieties and inadequate use
of organic matter, while in India the causes identiÔ¨Åed
ranged from cyclones to the removal of fertilizer
subsidies. There needs to be a better methodology
to quantify deceleration, stagnation and decline
processes and delineate affected areas as accurately
as possible.152

The particular characteristics of African farms pose
signiÔ¨Åcant problems in realizing an Asian-type Green
Revolution. The features that set Africa apart include:

These experiences are informing Africa‚Äôs approach to
addressing agricultural productivity and food security.
The following section looks at the elements of such an
approach.

‚Ä¢ key roles of women in agriculture and in ensuring
household food security;

4.2.3 Lessons from the Green Revolution
and relevance to Africa
IFPRI assesses the impacts of the Green Revolution
as follows: ‚ÄúThe Green Revolution was a major
achievement for many developing countries and gave
them an unprecedented level of national food security.
It represented the successful adaptation and transfer
of the same scientiÔ¨Åc revolution in agriculture that
the industrial countries had already appropriated for
themselves. The Green Revolution also lifted large
numbers of poor people out of poverty and helped

‚Ä¢ lack of a dominant farming system on which food
security largely depends;
‚Ä¢ predominance of rainfed agriculture as opposed
to irrigated agriculture;
‚Ä¢ heterogeneity and diversity of farming systems
and the importance of livestock;

‚Ä¢ under-investment

and

‚Ä¢ dominance of weathered soils of poor inherent
fertility;
‚Ä¢ lack of conducive economic and political enabling
environments;
‚Ä¢ large and growing impact of human health on
agriculture exacerbated by diseases such as
Aids and malaria;
‚Ä¢ low and stagnant labour productivity and minimal
mechanization; and
‚Ä¢ predominance of customary land tenure.154

58

Today‚Äôs African farmers could easily produce far more
food than they do, but they are constrained by their
lack of access to credit to cover production costs and
difÔ¨Åculties in Ô¨Ånding buyers and obtaining fair prices
to give them a minimal proÔ¨Åt margin. Under such
circumstances, what difference will a new technology
package make? Without addressing the underlying
reasons why African farmers leave farming or why
they under-produce, most initiatives will have little
impact on this trend.155
As this report has stressed, it is important to focus on
yields because yield gains have a signiÔ¨Åcant impact
on poverty reduction ‚Äì a one per cent increase in yield
translating into a 0.5 per cent to 0.8 per cent reduction
in poverty. The need to revive and sustain crop yield
growth is vital to attaining the MDGs.

4.3 TOWARDS A RAINBOW
REVOLUTION IN AFRICA
Calls for a new technology paradigm for African
agriculture have been made by NEPAD, the World
Bank, AGRA and other institutions and initiatives.
The 4th Pillar of the NEPAD Comprehensive Africa
Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP)
stresses the need to enhance the rate of adoption of
new technologies to increase productivity (through
better delivery systems and mechanisms that reduce
the costs and risk of adopting new technologies),
and the need to strengthen the ability of the research
systems to generate and adapt new knowledge and
technology. The 2008 World Development Report
considers science and technology as the lynchpin
to Africa‚Äôs future productivity growth, stressing the
importance of technologies such as conservation
tillage, integrated pest management, and new crop
varieties. The report calls for ensuring that innovations
and beneÔ¨Åts from new technologies target the poorer
segments of society more precisely and that relevant
food crops are planted to ensure that small-scale
farmers receive greater direct beneÔ¨Åts from technology
and innovations. This means reengineering systems to
cope with the unique characteristics of smallholders,
including low capital availability, low risk tolerance,
and the relatively low opportunity cost of family
labour.156 AGRA calls for an ‚ÄúAfrican consensus‚Äù on
policies to rapidly trigger agricultural productivity
growth through a uniquely African Green Revolution
‚Äì one that promotes equity, protects the environment,
and brings about comprehensive change across the

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2010

agricultural system. To move towards an agriculture
of the future better suited to feeding the world also
means producing more food in ever smaller extensions
of ever less fertile land by large groups of subsistence
farmers who will face growing obstacles to producing
substantial surpluses and may need to be encouraged
to partner with, or become, commercial farmers. A
broader and more integrated perspective is needed
for African agriculture, one that focuses on the entire
farming enterprise ‚Äì food and cash crops, livestock
and value-added processing.157
Since the Green Revolution, successful agroecological approaches have been created to help
sustain agricultural development.158 It has been
demonstrated that yields for the crops that the poor
rely on most ‚Äì such as rice, beans, maize, cassava,
potatoes and barley ‚Äì can increase several fold by
relying on local biodiversity, family labour and new
and traditional agro-ecological knowledge.
African agriculture according to a panel of African
experts ‚Äúis more likely to experience numerous
‚Äòrainbow evolutions‚Äô that differ in nature and extent
among the many systems, rather than one Green
Revolution as in Asia.‚Äù159 The alternative will be based
on agro-ecology, where the objectives are higher yields
together with improved soil conditions and decreased
dependence on water and irrigation. National policy
and investment decisions must be taken that target
scarce resources at speciÔ¨Åc national development
goals. The implication here is that, unlike the standard
technology packages of the earlier Green Revolution,
a future transformation of agricultural systems in
developing countries is likely to be based on tailormade solutions for different countries, and even local
contexts. Hence, the term ‚ÄòRainbow Revolution‚Äô. The
following are two examples from India and Brazil that
emphasize the need for tailor-made interventions to
increase productivity and access.

4.3.1 The Case of India: approach to a
second Green Revolution
The Ô¨Årst-ever national agricultural policy that was
referred to as the ‚Äúrainbow revolution‚Äù was launched
in India in 2000.160 The policy objective is to achieve
a growth rate in agriculture of over four per cent per
annum in the next two decades with total GDP growth
being sustained at 6.5 per cent. The policy calls for
stepping up public investment to narrow regional
imbalances and for accelerating the development

CHAPTER IV : CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES TO ACHIEVE FOOD SECURITY

of infrastructure that supports agricultural and rural
development, particularly rural connectivity.161 The
major components of the policy include:
‚Ä¢ Formulation of a timebound strategy for
rationalization and transparent pricing of inputs
to encourage judicious input use and to generate
resources for agriculture. Input subsidy reforms
will be pursued as a combination of price and
institutional reforms to keep costs under control.
A conducive climate will be created through a
favourable price and trade regime to promote
farmers‚Äô own investment and investments by
industries that produce inputs and other agrobased industries.
‚Ä¢ Encouragement of private sector investment
in agricultural research, HRD, post-harvest
management and marketing. All distortions in
incentives will be removed. Rural electriÔ¨Åcation
will be given high priority for adequately meeting
the demand of agriculture in a cost-effective
manner. All on-going irrigation projects will be
completed and modernized and an integrated
plan for augmenting and managing national
water resources will be launched.
‚Ä¢ Upgrading of marketing infrastructure and
development of modern techniques of
preservation, storage and transportation.
Producers‚Äô markets will be encouraged, as
will the setting up of agro-processing units
in producing areas. Collaboration between
producer cooperatives and the corporate sector
will be encouraged in the processing industry.
The Small Farmers Agro Business Consortium
(SFAC) will be energized to cater to the needs of
farmer-entrepreneurs and to promote public and
private investments.
‚Ä¢ Consolidation of land holdings on the pattern of
north-western states. There will be redistribution of
ceiling surplus lands and wastelands to landless
farmers and unemployed youths with initial startup capital, tenancy reforms to recognize the rights
of tenants and sharecroppers, development
of lease markets for increasing the size of land
holdings by making legal provisions for contract
farming. Land records will be updated and
computerized and land pass books issued to
farmers.

59

‚Ä¢ Progressive institutionalization of rural and
farm credit. Distortions in priority sector lending
by commercial banks will be removed and
cooperative banks will be revamped and given
more autonomy to function professionally. The
National Agriculture Insurance Scheme will be
made more farmer-speciÔ¨Åc and effective and will
provide package insurance policy from sowing to
post-harvest operations. Contingency agricultural
planning against natural disasters will be taken
up.
In short, the policy entails encouraging value-addition,
removing curbs on movement of agro-producers
within the country, protecting farmers against cheap
imports through tariffs and making available credit
and Ô¨Ånance.

4.3.2 The Case of Brazil: from a
technology taker to technology
exporter
Brazil is now one of the leading countries in the
development of tropical agricultural technology. This
position is a result of more than three decades of
public and private investment in the development
of technological packages tailored to its own soil
and agro-ecological conditions. The technology
developed in Brazil has been applied to both large
and small-scale farming, with important results for
both sectors.162
The country‚Äôs tropical agriculture has overcome the
difÔ¨Åculties of the 1970s, which were marked by low
production, poor diversiÔ¨Åcation and several food
crises. Too often, shortages of basic staples such
as rice, maize and wheat resulted in high prices
and consequently high inÔ¨Çation and an increase in
poverty. The 1970s were also characterized by low
productivity and a lack of speciÔ¨Åc knowledge, as well
as an institutional void in agricultural research and
education, and the lack of an efÔ¨Åcient domestic market
and strong government institutions.163 The challenge
at the time was to move away from applying standard
agricultural models to tropical agriculture towards
developing locally relevant agriculture technologies
that could address local conditions. At the same time,
there was a great need for public policies on agriculture
and food security to be articulated and implemented
and knowledge institutions to be developed.
The development of suitable technologies and
improvement in yields in Brazil has been the result

60

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2010

in Figure 16), thereby improving food security
and creating a surplus for the export of a range of
products. Productivity in this period almost doubled
from 1.5 tons/ha to nearly 3.0 tons/ha. In the meat
sector, genetic improvements and other production
techniques led to a drastic increase in the production
of beef, rising from 5.5 million tons in 1991 to nearly
10 million tons in 2008. The production of pork meat
nearly tripled from 1.1 million tons to 3.1 million tons
in 2008 and the production of poultry meat rocketed
from 2.7 to a stunning 11.3 million tons. The country
has managed to achieve not only food security but
also a situation of surplus and, in the process, has
become a major exporter of agricultural products, and
recently, of processed agricultural products, to the
developed and the developing world. In 2008 Brazil
exported grains and meat to nearly 100 countries.

of a mix of developments in domestic public policy,
international cooperation, private investment, and the
amount of land available for agriculture. The public
policies required included agricultural credit, land
technology, agricultural market policies (minimum
prices), investment in infrastructure, storage facilities,
agricultural research, education and rural extension.
The establishment of the Brazilian Agricultural
Research Cooperation (Embrapa) in 1973, a public
institution linked to the Ministry of Agriculture and
Food Supply, played a central role in the development
of Brazil‚Äôs agriculture in recent decades. Its efforts
have been complemented by a series of critical
public, private and institutional reforms, including the
reorganization of production chains, the establishment
of farmers‚Äô associations and the development of a
vibrant agro-industry to meet the needs of a diversiÔ¨Åed
group of farmers, not only those of larger farmers.
Cooperatives also played an important role in the
development of small-scale family farming.

The successes as well as the failures of Brazilian
agriculture are now being shared with other countries
especially in Africa, as Brazil has signed cooperation
agreements with a number of developed and
developing countries.

In the last two decades, grain production in Brazil
soared from less than 60 million tons in 1990/1991
to over 140 million tons in 2007/2008 (as shown

4.4 IMPLEMENTING A
UNIQUELY AFRICAN GREEN
REVOLUTION
Given the unsuitability of the Asian model of Green
Revolution to African realities, this report sketches out
a different approach to the problem of food security,
one that centres on the need to revive sub-Saharan
Africa‚Äôs depleted soils, improve the sustainability of
small-scale farming, raise the yields and incomes of
poor farmers, and help protect the natural resource
base of soil and water. Water management is
particularly important as only 30 per cent of land in
Africa is adapted to rainfed production.165
Achieving these goals will require increased and
targeted investments in agricultural inputs that targets
Africa‚Äôs diverse agro-ecologies. Unlike the Asian
Green Revolution whose technologies focused on a
limited range of cropping systems and irrigation, a
new approach must target research and development
investment into neglected crops such as sorghum,
millet, maize, cassava, cowpea to help increase their
yields. All this must be coupled with innovations in
policy, market structures and regulations.
The hope for a ‚ÄòRainbow Revolution‚Äô in 21st Century
agriculture, in the wake of the food crisis, must be
conditioned in three ways:
‚Ä¢ The lessons that can be drawn from the earlier
Green Revolution in Asia;
‚Ä¢ The new opportunities that have emerged in
recent decades, particularly those that are related
to the enabling environment, the new scientiÔ¨Åc
and technological developments; and
‚Ä¢ The present and anticipated challenges to
agricultural production, including land and water
management, the impacts of climate change,
and the issues of access to and sustainable
use of new agricultural technologies (especially,
biotechnology).
It has been argued that an African Green revolution can
be triggered by concerted and synchronized efforts
on two fronts: Ô¨Årst by working with African farmers and
other stakeholders to redesign and modernize the
complex African subsistence farming systems, and
second by applying modern science and technology
to produce robust technologies tested at farm level
and adapted to the respective agro-ecological
zones in Africa.166 A third front that this chapter adds

61

is to reduce crop losses by applying post-harvest
technologies and innovative management systems.
All of the above are not without serious implementation
constraints. The Windhoek High-Level Ministerial
Declaration on African Agriculture in the 21st Century
recognizes these constraints and takes up the now
familiar call for an African Green Revolution to help
boost agricultural productivity, food production and
national food security.
However African ministers went beyond the Asian
Green Revolution and noted that an African reprise
need not depend only on improved seed and fertilizer
but should also be built on a range of complementary
investments in rural development, including roads,
electricity, health and education. These aspects are
now being taken into account. For example, African
Heads of State and governments have endorsed
a vision for the restoration of agricultural growth,
food security, and rural development in Africa better
known as the Comprehensive Africa Agricultural
Development Programme (CAADP). One of the pillars
of this programme is NEPAD‚Äôs strategy for revitalizing,
expanding and reforming Africa‚Äôs agricultural research,
and technology dissemination and adoption efforts.
The three other pillars include: (a) extending the area
under sustainable land management and reliable water
control systems; (b) improving rural infrastructure and
trade-related capacities for improved market access;
and (c) increasing food supply and reducing hunger.
Each of these pillars incorporates policy, institutional
reform and capacity building. The goal is to attain
an average annual growth rate of six per cent in
agriculture. In Ghana, the current sector development
policy guideline (2008‚Äì2010) targets reducing rice
imports by 30 per cent by increasing production levels
to 370,000 tons per annum. SpeciÔ¨Åc measures to
reach this level of production include, among others,
increased mechanization, increased cultivation of
inland valleys, efÔ¨Åcient utilization of existing irrigation
systems and use of improved and high-yielding
varieties.167
Advances in Africa‚Äôs agricultural research, technology
dissemination and adoption will require signiÔ¨Åcant
changes in three areas: (a) strengthening Africa‚Äôs
capacity to build human and institutional capacity;
(b) empowering farmers, and (c) strengthening
agricultural support services.168 Box 6 outlines some
suggestions for the principles on which efforts to boost
Africa‚Äôs agricultural productivity should be based.

Box 6: Evolution and reform of agricultural institutions and services169
In order for Africa‚Äôs agricultural productivity efforts to be successful, they should reÔ¨Çect the principles of:
‚Ä¢ Empowerment of end-users to ensure their meaningful participation in setting priorities and work programmes for
research, extension, and training to ensure their relevance;
‚Ä¢ Planned subsidiarity to give responsibility and control over resources for agricultural research, extension, and
training activities at the lowest appropriate level of aggregation (local, national and regional);
‚Ä¢ Pluralism in the delivery of agricultural research, extension, and training services so that diverse skills and strengths
of a broad range of service providers (e.g. universities, NGOs, public and private sectors) can contribute to publicly
supported agricultural productivity operations;
‚Ä¢ Evidence-based approaches with emphasis on data analysis, including economic factors and market orientation in
policy development, priority setting and strategic planning for agricultural research, extension, and training;
‚Ä¢ Integration of agricultural research with extension services, the private sector, training, capacity building, and
education programmes to respond in a holistic manner to the needs and opportunities for innovation in the sector;
‚Ä¢ Explicit incorporation of sustainability criteria in the evaluation of public investments in agricultural productivity and
innovation programme (Ô¨Åscal, economic, social and environmental);
‚Ä¢ Systematic utilization of improved management information systems, in particular for planning, Ô¨Ånancial
management, reporting, and monitoring and evaluation;
‚Ä¢ Introduction of cost sharing with end-users, according to their capacity to pay, to increase their stake in the
efÔ¨Åciency of service provision and to improve Ô¨Ånancial sustainability; and
‚Ä¢ Integration of gender considerations at all levels, including farmers and farmer organizations, the private sector,
public institutions, researchers and extension staff.

4.5 SUMMARY
Financial resources are badly stretched in most
African countries. Policy-makers need to invest in the
most productive manner possible, putting resources
into areas that are most likely to have a large impact
on increasing smallholder productivity and improving
national food security. Nevertheless, there is also a
need for African countries to increase their investment
in agricultural development. A combination of smart
targeting of investment and greater overall levels of
public support for agriculture is needed. Today, only
a handful of African countries devote the agreed
target of 10 per cent of GDP in public expenditure in
agriculture.

as a result of the shift towards structural adjustment
lending with an emphasis on liberalization. This has
left many African countries badly positioned to face
the challenges posed by volatile prices for agricultural
inputs and food products and the impacts of climate
change.

Some research from India points to investment in rural
roads, research and extension and education as the
most effective investments to combat rural poverty,
but other evidence suggests that sub-Saharan African
countries should also pay close attention to irrigation
and rural electriÔ¨Åcation.

There are strong structural impediments to replicating
an Asian-style Green Revolution in Africa. The
heterogeneity of staple crops, farming systems and
the paucity of rural infrastructure make it clear that
no mechanistic replication of the Green Revolution
technology package is possible, or even desirable,
in Africa. SpeciÔ¨Åc African challenges and conditions,
and the need to pursue sustainable agricultural
development, mean that a truly African Green
Revolution should be very different from the Asian
Green Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s. The
package of measures needed must also go beyond
appropriate technology mixes and address other
constraints to smallholder farmers building stronger
technological and innovation capabilities.

Unfortunately, the international community has shown
decreasing interest in support for African agriculture
over the past 30 years. Support for agriculture as
a proportion of total international development
assistance to African countries has fallen by as
much as two-thirds from its peak in the early 1980s,

For too long, African agriculture has lagged farther
and farther behind other developing regions in
nearly every measure of agricultural productivity
and production. African production growth has
tended to rely on unsustainable increases in the
area under cultivation, while yields stagnate. A new

CHAPTER IV : CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES TO ACHIEVE FOOD SECURITY

agro-ecological approach, sometimes dubbed the
Rainbow Revolution, is needed to reverse these
trends. The interventions needed range from the triedand-true (increases in land under irrigation) to the
use of appropriate innovations to radically increase
productivity in African agriculture.
What has become clear, however, is that no intervention
can hope to succeed unless African smallholder
farmers are brought into the process. Their ability to
participate, however, depends on much more than
what happens on the farm. Which brings us to the next
set of concerns: the need to understand and radically
overhaul the enabling environment surrounding food
production and extending outwards into Ô¨Ånancing
agricultural investment, agricultural research, transport
and education systems, distribution and storage:

63

the panoply of food-related activities that take place
outside the farm itself that connect consumers with
the food they need.
This chapter has outlined the main challenges to
attaining food security in Africa and argued that
the solution cannot be a simple reproduction of the
Asian Green Revolution in Africa. Such an approach
will not achieve the same results in Africa, and that
model needs reÔ¨Ånement in any case to make it more
sustainable. A different set of approaches is needed in
Africa, geared to the diverse circumstances of African
smallholder farmers that are not only effective in raising
productivity but also meet more stringent conditions
on sustainability, especially in water and energy use.
We might refer to this as a uniquely African revolution
in agriculture, an ‚ÄòAfrican Rainbow Revolution‚Äô.

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2010

5.1

INTRODUCTION

This chapter discusses the different ways of how
technology is transferred and which process is best
suited to increase the productivity of smallholder
farmers. It points at the need for acquiring technologies
that are adapted to the local agro-ecological system
as a key part of any serious strategy for achieving
food security.
There is a well-recognized, acute need for smallholder
farmers to utilize more productive farming inputs,
tools and techniques. However, technology transfer
and diffusion in developing countries represents
a formidable challenge for a variety of reasons.
These include a lack of resources, the logistical and
communication difÔ¨Åculties of reaching the intended
recipient, extreme climate and poor soil conditions,
the lack of infrastructure, and the high incidence of
health issues and political instability. Together, these
constitute a major problem for anyone involved with
disseminating agricultural technologies. In addition,
our understanding of how new ideas, knowledge and
technologies are introduced into agricultural practice
remains incomplete. The traditional ‚Äòtechnology
push models‚Äô ‚Äì linear, research-dominated models
represented by technology pipelines ‚Äì have given way
in recent years to more systems-oriented approaches.
The innovation systems approach is increasingly being
applied to the analysis of innovation capabilities, and
broader STI capabilities, in manufacturing and even
services, and provides a useful framework of analysis
for STI capabilities in agriculture as well, using the
concept of agricultural innovation systems (AIS).
This concept builds directly on established work on
innovation systems and applies the framework to

agriculture. Accordingly, the AIS framework maps
the network of relations between the organizations,
institutions and policies in the agricultural system of
a country and examines the linkages among them.
Figure 2 in Chapter 2 presented the main elements
of an AIS. The AIS provides a convenient structure for
discussing the development of innovation capabilities
in agriculture in developing countries, even if we
accept that many of these countries may not actually
have fully functional AIS.
The movement towards more systems-oriented
approaches to research and technology development
is illustrated in Table 8, which highlights the proliferation
of more participatory approaches that place farmers
Ô¨Årmly within the research and technology development
processes as a central actor. This approach highlights
both the importance of research and knowledge as
inputs into agricultural production and that of linkages
to markets. Both are key considerations to developing
effective policies for agriculture. What is important is
that appropriate policies to promote technological
learning and innovation are different during the
different stages of the process and particular policy
measures are required to promote initial acquisition of
foreign technology, local diffusion and upgrading.170
It is important that in the early catch-up phase
countries not only develop their adaptive research
capabilities for agriculture, but also seek to capitalize
on the potentials of the traditional knowledge of
farmers. Addressing coordination failures which arise
in adoption of new commercial practices requires
institutional innovations.171

CHAPTER V : TRANSFER AND DIFFUSION OF AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY

5.1.1 The evolution of approaches to
agricultural research
Experiences in the identiÔ¨Åcation, development and
transfer of agricultural technology and diffusion can be
divided into the three broad approaches that evolved
over time since 1900 (see Table 8).
The farmer-participatory method of research is
generally well suited to Africa, with its variety of food
crops, diverse agro-ecological patterns and varying
socio-economic conditions. The participatory method
helps researchers to reach distinct constituencies of
farmers and provide each with the technologies most
relevant to its circumstances. The process encourages
ownership, enhancing the adoption and dissemination
of the new technologies. The Framework for African
Agricultural Productivity (FAAP), developed by the
Forum for Agricultural Research in Africa (FARA) and its
partners, also advocates putting farmers at the centre
of agricultural innovation systems by empowering
them to be active players in improving agricultural
productivity, not just in terms of increasing their yields,
but also in decision-making on how programmes and
policies are shaped.
National agricultural research systems in sub-Saharan
Africa require more efforts towards training, education
and revamping the extension services. Many including
FARA recognise that the role of extension systems
must shift from prescribing to facilitating. Moving
towards more participatory agricultural extension will
allow greater responsiveness to farmers‚Äô needs and
facilitate learning on how they can increase their own
productivity, raise their incomes, collaborate effectively
with one another (and with partners in agri-business
and agricultural research), and become actively
involved with major stakeholders in determining
the process and directions of innovation, including
technology generation and adoption.173
At this early stage, the strategic acquisition of
agricultural technology in all its forms represents the
best hope for improving agricultural productivity and
eradicating hunger and poverty in many developing
countries. Of course, technology cannot achieve such
lofty goals by itself. That is why it is vitally important to
consider the technology transfer process as a whole
to ensure its adoption by large groups of smallholder
farmers and local agri-businesses.
To facilitate this process, in recent years, many
countries have adopted a decentralized technology
diffusion model in order to increase awareness and

67

responsiveness regarding district-level opportunities.
This model should be seen as complimentary to, and
not a replacement for, a strong national-level technology
acquisition option. It should also be noted that not all
technologies are embodied in products or processes,
which may (or may not) be protected by intellectual
property law. Some technologies are disembodied and
exist within the mindset of individuals and the routines
of organizations, demanding a solid commitment to
education and training in order to develop a national
culture of innovation and discovery.
Before discussing the enabling environment
that facilitates the transfer and dissemination of
technologies, it is important to brieÔ¨Çy mention the
models of technology transfer that currently exist. To
a large extent there is an ongoing disparity between
the developed and developing world. It is therefore
important to acknowledge that the developing country
perspective differs substantially from the view of
technology transfer that exists in developed economies,
which is mainly focused on the commercialization of
new high-tech inventions either through technology
licensing agreements or the creation (and Ô¨Çotation or
sale) of spin-off companies. In developed countries,
invention has become the common currency of
business, so much so that a substantial international
trade has developed for commercializing patent rights
in many business sectors, including agriculture.

5.2 TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGY
Developing countries, and particularly LDCs, can
beneÔ¨Åt greatly from foreign technologies and
knowledge, assuming they are able to absorb them
effectively. Our understanding of the process of
‚Äòtransfer of technology‚Äô has evolved, in part because
several decades ago its usage commonly implied that
access to a technology meant that the technology was
automatically absorbed by the recipient with little effort
or cost. This idea has been refuted and discarded by
most analysts and there is today a general recognition
that a degree of technological effort by, and cost
to, a Ô¨Årm or a farmer is required for a technology to
be absorbed. The cost and effort involved may be
substantial, and generally requires some degree of
existing STI capabilities on the part of the recipient,
including a basic ability to learn and understand the
technology. There is also a risk involved in absorbing
the technology given that an investment is required
while the return on investment may not be known and
the user may prove unable to successfully absorb

68

the technology. A second important caveat is that
successful technological innovation based upon the
acquisition of a new technology from abroad may
require additional effort to adapt the technology for
local circumstances. For these reasons the term
‚Äòtransfer of technology‚Äô must be used with a clear
realization of these important caveats.174
Technology transfers can take place via many different
channels. These channels can be either marketbased (through trade, FDI or licensing) or non-marketbased (through technical assistance projects or
NGOs, among others). UNCTAD found that the most
important sources of technological innovation for Ô¨Årms
in developing countries included new machinery or
equipment, key personnel, internal R&D, collaboration
with customers, trade fairs, and collaboration with
suppliers and consultants.175 New machinery and
equipment was by far the most important source,
which implies that trade (that is, imports of capital
goods) is likely the most important source of such
innovation for these countries. However, UNCTAD
cautions that the effectiveness of imported foreign
technologies such as imported seeds, plants, animals
and machinery may have be limited by the local agroecological conditions. As outlined in Chapter 3, these
conditions vary widely in Africa. Adaptation may indeed
prove unsuccessful if local agro-ecological conditions
are very different (in terms of climate, rainfall and soil
quality) and as a result poorly suited to the foreign
technology.
Looking at developed country models, it could
seem natural to assume that the high-tech industrial
approach is best. However, in developing countries
even the most basic foundation technologies, which
are taken for granted in the developed world, cannot
be assumed. A much-quoted example of the way
governments can succeed by addressing concerns
taken for granted in developed countries is the targeted
voucher scheme for small-holder farmers to buy
fertilizer in Kenya, which was mentioned in Chapter 4.
What matters most in developing countries and LDCs
in particular is the set of domestic knowledge systems
which enable (or constrain) the creation, accumulation,
use and sharing of knowledge.176
The process of acquisition involves looking at the
wide range of technologies available from various
sources, and tries to identify the most appropriate mix
of solutions. International sources are invaluable in this
respect, including top companies and universities in
the developed world. The CGIAR coordinates a large

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2010

number of crop-speciÔ¨Åc research programmes and
has been directly responsible for many breakthroughs,
particularly in improving the quality of seed, techniques
and tools.
Other emerging and developing countries are also
an invaluable source of solutions, especially for
addressing similar domestic development situations.
The FAO‚Äôs Special Programme for Food Security
(SPFS) is a good example of the way techniques
successfully employed in one country can then be
transferred over to others. When SPFS was launched
in the mid-90s, the programme was originally designed
to disseminate simple low-cost solutions to improve
yield and farmer income. Since 2002 however, the
system has shifted towards working with individual
governments to establish programmes for improving
national food security. The main aim is to take the best
elements of ‚Äòwhat works‚Äô and craft it into a custommade plan for the host country. Over 100 countries
are now engaged in the SPFS system, and over half
of them have started implementing their customized
national plans.
Adaptation is important to ensure that individual
technologies are well suited to local conditions. In
many cases, technologies may already be in a form
that can be rolled out nationally without modiÔ¨Åcation.
Other technologies may require a careful evaluation
phase to assess their compatibility and safety
with respect to local conditions. It is essential that
appropriate standards are developed and maintained
to ensure that accreditation is enforced in line
with national policies on biodiversity, toxicity, etc.
Technology evaluation should be conducted under
realistic conditions and not subject to conÔ¨Çicts of
interest in the approval process. Local conditions may
throw up a variety of issues that require addressing.
For example, is local soil salinity likely to cause a new
irrigation pump to rust? If it is, the design may need to
be modiÔ¨Åed to incorporate non-corrosive materials.
Another vital consideration is whether a given
technology represents good value in terms of
the overall costs and beneÔ¨Åts, making it suitable
for adoption by smallholder farmers or local
businesses. Modifying the design may be possible
either to increase its performance or to reduce its
manufacturing complexity or cost. In some cases, the
necessary evaluation and adaptation work might be
carried out by the national department of agriculture
or university engineers, or may be contracted out to
local enterprises. This process is especially critical in

CHAPTER V : TRANSFER AND DIFFUSION OF AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY

nurturing links with local manufacturers, and should
be treated as a strategic partnering opportunity to fully
engage local manufacturers as a precursor to their
development of production-ready designs.
The question of how an individual technology will
be used by local people or businesses is central
to whether it will ultimately achieve widespread
acceptance. ‚ÄòLocalization‚Äô is therefore often required
before a technology can be successfully presented to
the end-user. This might include translating instructions
and training material into local languages or dialects
and, in the case of ICT, devices may require menus to
be conÔ¨Ågured or application-speciÔ¨Åc developments to
be undertaken.
The question of local user requirements is especially
important in regions where the population has been
decimated by disease or violent conÔ¨Çict. For example,
in some regions there has been a signiÔ¨Åcant shift
in farmer demographics toward older women and
children, who may Ô¨Ånd it difÔ¨Åcult to handle heavy
traditional tools or inputs. This is a serious problem that
underlines the importance of implementing a ‚Äòneeds
identiÔ¨Åcation‚Äô feedback loop, both at the local and
national levels, capable of rapidly developing practical
strategies for modifying tools and techniques to fully
reÔ¨Çect grassroots realities. Such concerns highlight
once again the centrality of maintaining a joined-up
‚Äòsmallholder-friendly‚Äô perspective that consciously
prioritizes practical productive support over long-shot
‚Äòesoteric‚Äô research programmes.

5.3 TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION
Providing technically competent solutions well suited
to local conditions is only part of the story. There are
many examples of extremely promising technologies
that have failed to gain acceptance by smallholder
farmers due to the lack of an enabling environment
(as discussed earlier) or poorly conceived or delivered
dissemination campaigns.

5.3.1 Enabling environment for
technology adoption
The power of technology in the hands of poor
farmers has been demonstrated by farmers in many
developing countries. In Malawi, for example, the
government initiated a programme in 1998 to give
the poorest farmers a ‚Äòstarter pack‚Äô of free fertilizers
and seeds, and this resulted in a national surplus

69

of corn. However, the forced scrapping of the
programme and selling of Malawi‚Äôs strategic grain
reserves under structural adjustment policies had
tragic consequences until it was reversed by a new
administration that reintroduced the fertilizer subsidy
programme. The results again were staggering:
bumper harvests for two years in a row, a surplus
of one million tons of maize, and Malawi started to
export corn to the region. This is a case where access
to credit facilitated the use of an existing technology.
Rwanda, the United Republic of Tanzania, Kenya and
Nigeria are now following suit.177
In order for new tools and techniques to achieve
widespread adoption, every aspect of the technology
dissemination process requires careful consideration,
including any Ô¨Åeld trials, the availability of samples
or subsidies to encourage uptake, and farmerfriendly Ô¨Ånance. Implementing a well-orchestrated
communication and training programme plays a
vital role in convincing the wider audience to make
the switch to a different way of working. Ultimately,
however, there is no substitute for a well-funded, wellprepared national extension services network. Given
the wide range of technologies and the greater need
for local autonomy, extension workers will be required
to perform an increasingly difÔ¨Åcult role, which demands
full recognition and support at both the national and
international level. The FAO has written a practical
guide for policy-makers entitled ‚ÄòModernizing National
Extension Systems‚Äô which provides an excellent
framework for improving the effectiveness of extension
systems.178
In most cases the successful dissemination of
technology is also strongly reliant on other parties,
especially agriculture research institutions, the private
sector, farmers‚Äô groups, NGOs and civil society groups.
The complexity of the international development
community requires careful planning and coordination
in order to ensure that compatible messages and
solutions are being delivered at the local level.
The more ‚Äòmodern‚Äô model of a decentralized, demanddriven technology transfer process requires not just
decentralization of funding and control, but also
decentralization of the information resources that are
essential for a self-sustaining agro-economic system.
Proactive strategies for nurturing agri-business
innovation links are therefore of key importance, and
should utilize as much as possible existing networking
structures (i.e. including both real and ‚Äòvirtual‚Äô
communities).

70

Nurturing local businesses, especially those involved
in agricultural input distribution, is an essential
ingredient for disseminating improved technologies.
As mentioned in the previous chapter, the Alliance
for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA), working with
support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation,
has implemented an Agro-Dealer Development
Programme to help African farmers increase yields on
limited land. A strong agro-dealer system is crucial to
farmers‚Äô success because these local retailers serve
as the primary conduits of farm inputs, such as seeds
and soil nutrients, and knowledge about their safe
and efÔ¨Åcient use. Another important way to nurture
local businesses is the process of match-making
candidate technologies with existing or new domestic
businesses. This might include making commercial
farmers aware of new or improved seed strains,
or educating local manufacturers and distributors
about emerging product opportunities. This business
networking function is of immense importance in
‚Äòwiring-up‚Äô supply chains critical to the success of
efforts to diffuse technologies to smallholder farmers.

5.4 INTERNATIONAL
COOPERATION: EMERGING
MODALITIES IN AGRICULTURE
TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER
The previous sections have discussed how national
policies can help establish an enabling environment
for the development of stronger technology and
innovation capabilities in developing countries. While
the domestic dimension remains the predominant
one with regard to innovation in agricultural innovation
policy, international cooperation represents a
signiÔ¨Åcant means of facilitating technology transfer. In
this regard, South-South and triangular cooperation
are becoming increasingly important channels for the
diffusion of agricultural technologies and knowledge.

5.4.1 South-South cooperation
Bilateral and inter-regional South-South cooperation
has a strong potential to enhance the effectiveness
of international development efforts while improving
national ownership. South-South cooperation in
agricultural technologies facilitates the transfer
of new and/or older (but more affordable and still
efÔ¨Åcient) technologies that are necessary for boosting
agricultural productivity. The agricultural cooperation

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2010

activities of countries such as Cuba, China and India
in Africa are well established, in some cases going
back to the times of the Bandung conference (the Ô¨Årst
major Afro-Asian conference) in 1955.
Several other developing countries, regional initiatives
and funds are now becoming active partners for
South-South technical and economic cooperation.
These include, in addition to those mentioned above,
Brazil, Indonesia, Malaysia and Turkey, to name just
a few. In addition, inter-regional initiatives such as
the IBSA Fund for Alleviation of Poverty and Hunger,
created in 2003 under the framework of the India,
Brazil and South Africa Forum are also active in SouthSouth cooperation.179 Also at the inter-regional level,
the Africa-South America Summit agreed to exchange
knowledge and to promote transfer of technology in
a number of issues including agriculture. The 2009
Brazil, Russian Federation, India and China summit
reafÔ¨Årmed the countries‚Äô commitment to boost
agricultural development in Africa by enumerating a
number of measures for the coming years.
The number of South-South cooperation initiatives
undertaken by single countries is also growing. The
Africa-India Cooperation Summit launched in April 2008
aims to build stronger cooperation ties between Africa
and India, an important actor in tropical technology.
A similar summit was held with Turkey in 2008, also
focusing on the development of African agriculture.
The Republic of Korea launched its Initiative for Africa
Development in 2006. Within Africa, South Africa is a
key player in the transfer of technologies.
Many national and international programmes and
information resources currently seek to facilitate
access to improved agricultural technology.
Programmes run by CGIAR, FAO, IFAD, UNDP
Millennium Villages, USAID, DFID, Rockefeller, Gates
/ Buffet, CNFA, and others continue to provide a large
number of practical solutions throughout the world.
For example, in 2008, AGRA, JICA and NEPAD signed
a joint initiative for doubling rice production in Africa
by the year of 2018 from 14 million tons to 28 million
tons including projects for dissemination of NERICA.
The project is to be conducted under the framework
of the Coalition for African Rice Development (CARD),
a consultative group including donors, rice research
institutions, and development entities working in 21
African countries. Since its establishment in 2008 it
has established National Rice Development Strategies
in 12 countries.

CHAPTER V : TRANSFER AND DIFFUSION OF AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY

5.4.2 Africa‚Äôs cooperation with China
and Brazil
China, as the leading player among developing
countries in development cooperation projects on the
African continent has been heavily involved in supporting
agricultural development for decades. China‚Äôs different
areas of support range from production, training, and
infrastructure to trade. The Chinese development
cooperation activities in Africa are expected to be
strengthened at the IV Ministerial Conference of FOCAC
(Forum China Africa Cooperation) in November 2009
when agriculture and food security will be a key theme.
The FOCAC was created in 2000 in Beijing. At the 3rd
FOCAC (Beijing, 2006) China announced its intention to
double aid to Africa by 2009. The projects of cooperation
are focusing to a great extent on the agriculture and
infrastructure sectors. In 2009 for example, the country is
building 14 centres for agricultural research in a number
of African countries. Over 100 agricultural scientists from
China are working in the Ô¨Åeld with African technicians
in order to improve food security on the continent and
generate export surpluses where it is possible. China is
an important source of Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs)
in Africa including in the agricultural sector.
Brazil is also becoming an increasingly important partner
for African countries in the promotion of agriculture and
rural development. The main vehicle for the transfer of
Brazilian expertise in tropical agricultural technology to
African countries is Embrapa, the Brazilian institution
of agricultural research. While Embrapa has a long
experience of international cooperation at a relatively
small scale, in recent years it has undertaken more
ambitious cooperation projects with the support of the
Brazilian Cooperation Agency of the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs. In 2006, Embrapa opened an ofÔ¨Åce in Accra,
Ghana.
Embrapa Africa is an initiative that envisages not only
to transfer and Ô¨Åeld-test tropical technology know-how
acquired by Brazil but also to learn from successful
experiences in other developing countries. Projects in
Africa were initially focused mainly on the Portuguesespeaking countries, namely Angola, Mozambique,
Guinea Bissau and Cab Verde. Subsequently, a number
of other African countries such as Ghana, Benin, the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea, Kenya, and
Ethiopia have signed technical cooperation agreements.
Brazil is now working towards a broad partnership that
includes all members of the African Union in technological
transfer and agricultural capacity-building projects.

71

Another example, the Cotton-4 (C-4) project, helps to
transfer technology to Mali, Chad, Benin and Burkina
Faso in the form of genetic material, production
systems, training on market and trade issues and
other capacity-building. The C-4 project focuses on
integrated soil management, the control of biological
pests, and the management of plant varieties. The
project has a total budget of $4 million, of which
$3.5 million is devoted to agriculture and the rest
to basic services. A Ô¨Årst farming model project was
implemented in Mali and the results will be distributed
to other Cotton-4 countries as well as other African
countries.

5.4.3 Triangular cooperation
The concept of triangular cooperation refers to
South-South cooperation carried out in partnership
with a Northern donor (or donors) or international
organizations who provide Ô¨Ånancial and technical
assistance. A growing number of donor countries are
actively engaged in triangular cooperation projects.
These include Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom,
the United States and the EU.
Another example of triangular cooperation is the PanAfrican Cassava Initiative (NPACI) launched by NEPAD
in 2004. This project, created with funding from the
W.K. Kellogg Foundation, focuses on the enormous
potential of cassava in Africa for food security
and income generation. The project is based on a
transformation strategy that focuses on developing
three interrelated components: market research and
development, technology generation for development,
and competitive and sustainable production.180
Triangular cooperation could also play a signiÔ¨Åcant
role in the framework of the Comprehensive Africa
Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP).

5.4.3.1 Japan and triangular cooperation
Japan‚Äôs International Cooperation Agency (JICA)
provides a number of successful experiences of
triangular cooperation in agriculture. An example
of this is provided by the NERICA project Ô¨Ånanced
mainly by Japan and UNDP that aims at creating new
varieties of rice that are drought resistant and offer
higher productivity. NERICA rice is based on African
drought-resistant varieties and high-yield varieties
from Southeast Asia. NERICA has been proven to
increase production of rice in Benin by 400 per cent
and is now becoming widely cropped in Africa.

72

Another case of Japanese involvement in triangular
cooperation is provided by the project being carried
out in cooperation with Brazil in Mozambique, where
agro-ecological conditions are very much similar
to those of the Cerrados of Brazil, a region where
Japan also contributed signiÔ¨Åcantly to agricultural
development in the 70s. The main purpose of the
project is to transfer technology developed in Brazil
over the last decades and at the same time to learn
from Africa‚Äôs experiences.

5.4.3.2 Multilateral organizations and
triangular cooperation
Several multilateral institutions are working in the Ô¨Åeld
of triangular cooperation, particularly in Africa. A good
example is the FAO Special Programme for Food
Security (SPFS) which provides transfer of tropical
technology for many African countries on the basis of
South-South transfer of technology, with contributions
from a number of countries including China, Cuba,
Egypt, India, Jordan, Morocco, Myanmar, Pakistan,
the Philippines, Tunisia and Vietnam. UNIDO‚Äôs centres
for South-South Industrial Cooperation, which support
the development of agro-industry in the South, are
another example.

5.5 SUMMARY
Acquiring and adapting technologies new to the local
agro-ecological system, either from abroad or from
local sources (research institutes or universities, for
example) is a key part of any serious strategy for
achieving food security. Selection of technologies
appropriate to the conditions within the host food
system is crucial . State-of-the-art, high-tech solutions
may not always be the most appropriate for the needs
of smallholder farmers. Adopting a pragmatic mix of
technologies (low-, medium- and high-tech) that best
meets their needs is the ideal.

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2010

A balanced technology acquisition approach must
balance the contrasting challenges of technology
selection, adaptation and diffusion. It is not enough
for a technique to be technically sound, it must
also be adapted to suit the speciÔ¨Åc conditions
found on the ground, and be made affordable and
attractive enough to smallholder farmers to achieve
wide diffusion. Models of public-private partnership
that make not only public institutes but also forproÔ¨Åt enterprises into stakeholders for the diffusion
model can be valuable in building a self-sustaining
momentum behind dissemination efforts. Such a
model stands the best chance of being demanddriven ‚Äì succeeding because farmers demand
its continuation, rather than due to a top-down
bureaucratic decision.
International cooperation can also be a strong
factor in helping relevant new technologies be
adopted, adapted and diffused throughout host
economies. In particular, a handful of SouthSouth cooperation models have already proven
their worth as mechanisms for ensuring the right
technological tools are made available to African
farmers. So-called triangular cooperation, where a
Northern neighbour signs on as a sponsor to SouthSouth technology-sharing efforts, has also shown
promise as a model for the international diffusion of
technologies.
Successful adoption and mastery of new
technologies by smallholders requires adequate
absorptive capacity on their part. Successful
technology transfer is not necessarily easy to
achieve and entails some cost on the part of the
farmer to learn the technology. Still, the returns from
successful technology transfer can be very large.
The next chapter discusses the important elements
in choosing appropriate mixes of technologies in
a manner suitable to the diversity of local agroecological conditions found in Africa.

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2010

INTRODUCTION

This chapter discusses some technologies that can be
adopted by small-holder farmers to increase yield and
generate a range of other potential beneÔ¨Åts (such as
poverty alleviation and environmental conservation).
The chapter distinguishes between three broad types
of (modern) agricultural technologies. First, there is
mechanical technology, encompassing various degrees
of mechanization of agricultural operations and ranging
from simple traditional hand tools to animal- and enginepowered equipment, implements and farm machinery
and irrigation systems that control the timing and volume
of water. Second, there is biological or biochemical
technology, composed of a package of high-yielding
varieties of seeds, chemical fertilizers and pesticides.
Third, is biotechnology, consisting of commercially
acceptable techniques that use living organisms or
parts thereof to make or modify a product; this includes
improving, modifying or manipulating the characteristics
of economically important plants and animals and their
derivative products and developing microorganisms
that act favourably on the environment for agricultural
production.
This classiÔ¨Åcation enables us to analyze the signiÔ¨Åcance
of each type of modern agricultural technology
individually and to capture the interactions between
them. As will be apparent from the analysis that follows, a
combination of all three types of technologies is needed
in order to attain food security. Again as pointed out
earlier, for these technologies to be adapted by farmers
will depend on their prior existing absorptive capacities.

6.2 MECHANICAL TECHNOLOGY
The technologies of agricultural mechanization can be
classiÔ¨Åed broadly into hand-tool technology, animaldraught technology and mechanical power technology.
In addition to the above classiÔ¨Åcation, a discussion
on mechanical technology must consider speciÔ¨Åc
agricultural operations that are more susceptible to
mechanization. For this purpose, agricultural operations
can be grouped into two categories, power-intensive
and control-intensive:
‚Ä¢ Power-intensive operations require relatively large
amounts of energy and include land preparation
(use of tractors), pumping irrigation water (use of
motorized pumps instead of bullock-drawn wheels)
and thrashing of grain (rice or maize milling in place
of hand pounding).

‚Ä¢ Control-intensive operations depend relatively
more on human judgment. These include seeding,
fertilizer application, weeding, pest and disease
control, winnowing (separating grain from chaff)
and crop harvesting.
The more tedious, power-intensive operations
tend to be mechanized Ô¨Årst. This explains why
African governments initially promoted large-scale
mechanically powered technology. Government-run
tractor hire services were introduced and commercial
banks provided soft loans at low interest rates to
purchase tractors. However, in the 1980s and the
1990s, the entire scheme collapsed and African
countries redirected their policies to draught animal
power (DAP).181
The new approach bore mixed results across Africa.
In Mali, use of DAP increased the area under cotton
cultivation nearly four-fold, raised yields six times
over and animal traction adoption rates jumped to 80
per cent between 1968 to 1986.182 Nigerian farmers
using DAP derived supplementary income by renting
them out to other farmers.183 Similarly, in Kenya the
use of DAP brought about higher yields and greater
economic efÔ¨Åciency, including less weeding.184 The
use of DAP for inter-row weeding in the United Republic
of Tanzania reduced the time spent on weeding from
48 hours per hectare to 30 hours per hectare.185
While the use of tractors in Asia increased from one
per 2200 hectares to one for every 76 hectares in four
decades, tractor use in Africa has remained relatively
constant (see Figure 17).
In Africa, less than one per cent of farmland is
worked by tractors and only 10 per cent is worked
by draft animals. Thus nearly 90 per cent is worked
by hand, from initial ploughing to planting, weeding,
and harvesting.187 It is however important to assess
the advantages of moving up the technology ladder
in terms of productivity gains and timeliness of
cultivation, employment for the landless poor and
increased cropping intensity. Direct comparison of the
exact timing of critical agricultural operations between
farms using tractors and draught animals in six Asian
countries shows little or no timeliness advantage for
mechanization.188
In addition, the potential labour-displacing effects of
increased mechanization, in the context of a dominant
small farm sector and land insecurity throughout the
developing world, tends to make mechanization
an emotive issue. An examination of the patterns of

farm equipment use in Eastern, Central and southern
Africa suggests strongly that expanded use and local
manufacture of simple but well adapted items of
farm equipment can make a signiÔ¨Åcant contribution
to increases in productivity and incomes on family
farms, the growth of rural-based manufacturing and
the expansion of non-farm output and employment.

6.3 IRRIGATION SYSTEMS
In some developing countries, irrigation plays a major
role in food production and food security, representing
up to 95 per cent of all water use. Agriculture is by
far the largest consumer of water, accounting for
some 70 per cent of all water withdrawn from rivers
for agricultural, domestic and industrial purposes
worldwide. Yet only just seven per cent of African
arable land is irrigated compared to ten per cent in
South America, 29 per cent in East and Southeast
Asia and 41 per cent in South Asia.
The agricultural development strategies of most
countries depend on maintaining, improving and
expanding irrigated agriculture. However, the steadily

increasing demand on water resources means
irrigation for agriculture is facing growing competition
from other activities. Water is already scarce in many
places and the imbalance between the availability of
water and the pursuit of agriculture for food will likely
be aggravated by climate change.

6.3.1 Irrigation technologies and
management systems
Investments in irrigation and better management of
existing systems have increased crop yields, creating
jobs and raising rural economic growth in many
developing countries. Irrigated lands now account
for about 20 per cent of the world‚Äôs farmed area and
40 per cent of global food production. Increases in
irrigated areas, cropping intensity, and crop yields
have helped stabilize food production per capita,
even though population and per capita food intake
have grown signiÔ¨Åcantly. While the largest potential for
increased yields in the near future comes from the 450
million smallholders in developing countries, most of
these producers are poor farmers and are therefore
not able to respond to increased food prices due to

76

their inability to access the farming inputs needed to
raise production, unless public and private investment
in irrigation becomes a priority.
The past three decades have seen the development
and commercialization of innovative irrigation
techniques. Many of the new techniques have been
designed for relatively large and fairly sophisticated
systems, and tend to be adopted by well-resourced
farmers. These techniques include automated canal
and piped water delivery systems, laser land levelling
for surface irrigation applications, automated sprinkle
irrigation, microirrigation (including surface and subsurface drip systems), and sophisticated control
systems for managing these technologies. The
majority of resource-poor smallholders are not able to
afford these types of irrigation technology.
Unless the special irrigation technology needs of
smallholders are addressed and the prices of these
technologies are substantially reduced, small-holder
farmers will continue to be excluded from the beneÔ¨Åts
such technologies. Irrigation systems must match
smallholders‚Äô unique characteristics, including small
landholdings, low capital availability, low risk tolerance,
and a relatively low opportunity cost of family labour.189
Examples of improved irrigation technologies in the
water supply, water conveyance and water application
components of irrigation systems suitable for
smallholders include:
‚Ä¢ Low-cost drip irrigation for efÔ¨Åcient water
application. Thanks to precise timing, drip irrigation
allows higher uniformity and accuracy in the amount
of water applied. Farmers in Asia using drip irrigation
reported yield increases of between 50 and 100 per
cent and decreases in water use ranging from 40
to 80 per cent compared to their experience with
traditional surface irrigation systems. More than
200,000 low-cost drip irrigation systems have been
distributed through market channels in India, Nepal
and other parts of Asia.
‚Ä¢ Treadlepumps for water lifting. A treadle pump is
a simple, low-cost, foot-operated pump that can lift
water from depths of up to seven metres with a Ô¨Çow
rate ranging from about 30 to 80 litres per minute.
The retail cost of a basic pump ranges from $12 to
$15, including the wood or bamboo treadles and
the support structure. Their design and construction
is simple, so local craftsmen can manufacture them
using readily available tools and materials and they
can be maintained and repaired easily by the users.

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2010

The foot valve at the bottom of each cylinder is made
from rubber that can be replaced using a discarded
bicycle tyre inner tube. The two pistons keep water
in motion during the up- and down-strokes, resulting
in a continuous Ô¨Çow and efÔ¨Åcient use of manual
energy. These features make such pumps ideal
for use by poor smallholder farmers. The treadle
pump was the Ô¨Årst new irrigation technology to be
successfully and widely distributed using a business
development approach.
‚Ä¢ Bagging water for irrigation. Low-cost plastic
water tanks are used to store runoff water collected
during the rainy season from small catchments or
water from perennial wells or streams for use in the
dry season. They bring the beneÔ¨Åts of supplemental
irrigation to smallholders who have no other access
to irrigation water. Each tank stores 10 cubic metres
of water that is completely enclosed to eliminate
evaporation losses. The tanks cost roughly $40 each
and have a life expectancy of about Ô¨Åve years.

6.3.2 Predicting when to irrigate
Small- to moderate-sized farms can beneÔ¨Åt from the
efÔ¨Åcient scheduling of irrigation. Irrigation Decision
Support Systems (IDSS) are computerized scheduling
programmes and water management systems that
aim to improve water-use and distribution efÔ¨Åciencies
for optimum crop production.190 Such systems can
help save water, particularly during times of drought.
Typically, an IDSS is based on weather station data
and crop growth models and is linked to a network
information system, including local radio links, wellsuited to informing small-holder farmers in developing
countries. In Africa, water-saving irrigation scheduling
advice is currently transmitted from a computing
centre in South Africa, linked by telecommunication
networks to farmers in other provinces and countries,
including Zimbabwe and Swaziland, with a further
service planned for the United Republic of Tanzania.
Decision support systems are driving research towards
‚Äòprecision agriculture‚Äô, an approach to farming which
uses satellite data to determine soil conditions and
plant development, in order to Ô¨Åne-tune the use of
technologies such as fertilizer or water use. ‚ÄòPrecision
agriculture‚Äô can thus provide farmers with information
to make better management decisions, reduce costs
and increase proÔ¨Åt margins.191

6.3.3 Available technological solutions
Solutions for farming with limited water that can help
offset the impact of water scarcity and the expected
negative impacts of climate change and increasing
water shortages are outlined in Table 9.

6.4 BIOLOGICAL TECHNOLOGY
If the original planting material happens to be of poor
quality, it will result in poor yields and generate losses
to the farmer.192 A great deal of plant breeding has
been undertaken with some crops to meet a wide
range of quality attributes. For example, commercial
fruit and vegetable varieties are available in varying

Table 9. Solutions for water management
Solution

Application

Drip irrigation

The technique involves dripping down
water directly to the roots of plants,
via a well-deÔ¨Åned assembly of pipes,
tubings and valves.

Desalination of seawater

Desalination of seawater has emerged
as a viable solution that can help utilize
this vast resource.

Use of moisture sensorbased irrigation system

The use of moisture sensors to control
irrigation in a conventional drip
irrigation system. It could be applied
to farms in a small area. The devices
used could be solar- or wind-powered
and can be networked with mobile
connectivity.

Recycling wastewater

Channels could be established to
recycle used city water that can be
used for varied purposes, including
freshwater for irrigated farming.

Rainwater storage

In areas where freshwater for irrigation
is very scarce, tanks can be set up to
store rainwater for productive irrigation.

Regular maintenance of
irrigation systems

Regular maintenance is needed to
Ô¨Åx leaks around Ô¨Åttings, cracks/
disconnects in the water line due to
tractor or vehicle damage, holes in drip
tape and broken sprinkler heads.

Use of city water

Public policies and incentives to
promote the prudent use of water by
households by creating a positive and
appropriate price for water usage.
Reuse of city water for domestic as
well as agricultural purposes. For
agriculture, there is no need to purify
the water and little management is
required for its use.

shapes, sizes, colours, productivity levels, pest and
disease resistance levels (the primary drivers for
breeding). Dry matter and taste attributes as well as
ripening times and rates and post-harvest longevity
have also inÔ¨Çuenced the breeding process.193 This
underscores the importance of demand-driven
provision of planting material as a critical ingredient
for genetic technical change in a cropping system194.

6.4.1 New Rice for Africa
New Rice for Africa (‚ÄòNERICA‚Äô) was developed by the
former West Africa Rice Development Association
(WARDA), now known as the Africa Rice Center
(ARC), to improve the yield of African rice varieties.
The NERICA Project was funded by the African
Development Bank, the Japanese government, and
the United Nations Development Programme. African
rice (O. glaberrima Steud.) and Asian rice (O. sativa L.)
were crossbred to produce progeny that combine the
best traits of both parents. These include high yields
from the Asian parent and drought resistance and
hardiness from the African parent. The progeny were
dubbed New Rice for Africa (NERICA) and the name
was trademarked in 2004. NERICA is not a genetically
modiÔ¨Åed variety. Nearly 20 different NERICA varieties
have been developed and a number of them are
already being commercially cropped in many African
countries. The main advantages of NERICA include:
‚Ä¢ higher yields (by 50 per cent without fertilizer and
by more than 200 per cent with fertilizer);
‚Ä¢ earlier maturity (by 30 to 50 days); and
‚Ä¢ resistance to local stress (acid soil, improved
drought resistance.
The crop responds to the needs of millions of upland
and dryland rice farmers of sub-Saharan Africa and
therefore has the potential to increase income and
alleviate poverty in the region. For example, in Benin
where agriculture employs 75 per cent of labour and
where 80 per cent of rice farmers are women, some
farmers are able to invest the proÔ¨Åts of NERICA in
diversifying their agriculture with other cash crops
such as peanuts, soya and corn. NERICA rice varieties
have proven able to boost Benin‚Äôs rice production in
some cases up to fourfold the current output. A new
FAO project aims to support the dissemination and
cropping of high quality seeds including NERICA
varieties to support Benin in achieving the goal of
more than doubling rice production to over 300,000
tons by 2011, thereby reversing the country‚Äôs strong

78

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2010

dependency in rice imports and enabling it to become
an exporter for sub-regional, regional and even the
European market. A number of African countries
(Guinea, Nigeria, C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire and Uganda) now
consider NERICA a priority, as do development
cooperation agencies.195

6.4.2 Developing disease-resistant crops
Increasing disease resistance in crops is another
means to increase plant yields, as disease can
seriously limit productivity. For example, the pearl
millet downy mildew disease caused by the fungus
Sclerospora graminicola was responsible for yield
reductions estimated at 30 per cent in the Eritrean
region of Anseba in 2000.
Research by CGIAR scientists, in collaboration with
national agricultural research systems in Africa,
has helped control two major diseases of cassava
‚Äì bacterial blight and leaf mosaic ‚Äì through genetic
breeding, the incorporation of resistance genes into
high-yielding cassava varieties, and an Africa-wide
programme of biological control of the cassava
mealybug. The late maturing six-tons-per-hectare-

varieties have been replaced by varieties that yield
20‚Äì30 tons per hectare. Box 7 highlights some crop
varieties that have been developed in Brazil, for
disease resistance and other attributes, which could
prove beneÔ¨Åcial to African farming.

6.5 FERTILIZERS, PESTICIDES
AND TILLAGE TECHNOLOGIES
Fertilizers (be they organic or inorganic) supply
essential elements to the growth of plants. These
elements include nutrients such as nitrogen,
phosphorus, potassium, and sulphur, as well as trace
elements such as iron, zinc, and magnesium. Organic
fertilizers are made from materials derived from living
organisms, while chemical fertilizers are manufactured
from nonliving materials such as rock phosphate.
Organic fertilizers must Ô¨Årst be broken down by soil
microorganisms into simpler, inorganic molecules and
ions. In contrast, the nutrients in chemical fertilizers are
already in inorganic form and so can be immediately
used by the plants. Both organic and inorganic
fertilizers have advantages and disadvantages. While
inorganic fertilizers are immediately available to plants

Box 7: New crop varieties of crops that could be transferred to Africa196

‚Ä¢ BRS Serid√≥ Cotton, of average size, a perennial, for family-based agriculture in the Semi-arid zone.

79

CHAPTER VI : TECHNOLOGY MIXES FOR SMALL-SCALE FARMING

they are subject to leaching, especially with nitrogen.
Heavy applications of inorganic fertilizers can also
build up toxic concentrations of salts in the soil. On
the other hand, as mentioned above, organic fertilizers
(such as manure) are not immediately available to the
plants. However organic material does more than
provide organic nutrients. It also improves the soil
structure, and increases its ability to hold both water
and nutrients.

in Senegal, fertilizer use increased from 13,000
to 96,000 tons between 1970 and 1976, and then
dropped to 1,500 tons in the 1990s. Food-producing
farmers are often the most severely affected by such
cuts due to their low income, compared to export
crop farmers. The latter use an average of 30 kg of
chemical fertilizer per hectare, compared to 5 kg by
the former.197

Despite its abundance, nitrogen cannot be assimilated
by plants directly from the air. Bacteria at the root of
certain plants are therefore needed to ‚ÄòÔ¨Åx‚Äô nitrogen (i.e.
convert atmospheric nitrogen into compounds such
as ammonia), allowing it to then be used by plants.
Up to 35 per cent of the total productive capacity of all
crops is ascribed to this single input. It is the source
of most food protein. Of the total 175 million tons of
nitrogen Ô¨Åxed naturally worldwide, 35 million tons are
Ô¨Åxed by cropped leguminous plants compared with
the 40 million tons Ô¨Åxed industrially.

Small-holder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa use only
a tenth of the global average inorganic fertilizer use.
The annual total input of fertilizers in Africa is only 21
kg (nutrients) per ha of harvested land, compared
to 100 kg/ha for South Asia, 135 kg/ha for East and
Southeast Asia, 73 kg/ha for Latin America and 206
kg/ha for the industrial countries. The widening gap
between Africa and Asia‚Äôs fertilizer use is illustrated in
Figure 18. The low level of fertilizer use in Africa is due
to the fact that fertilizers are much more costly in Africa
than the average world market price and fertilizers are
not readily available to farmers in remote areas due to
inadequate infrastructure, or to farmers being simply
too poor to afford them.

During the 1960s and 1970s, the use of inorganic
fertilizers was spurred by government subsidies in
most developing countries. With the elimination of
subsidies, fertilizer use dropped sharply. For example,

According to Borlaug, the key to unlocking the potential
of agriculture in Africa and restoring the health of the
continent‚Äôs soils is a practice known as ‚Äòintegrated
soil fertility management‚Äô (ISFM).199 This practice
combines the use of organic and inorganic nutrients
with mineral nutrients to increase crop yields. It is
an integrated approach to agricultural intensiÔ¨Åcation
that fosters both technical and institutional change.
The approach focuses on the timing and placing of
inputs to maximize nutrient-use efÔ¨Åciency. The ISFM
approach must be tailored both to the characteristics
of the site and the constraints faced by the farmer.
It also demands an emphasis on context-speciÔ¨Åc,
adaptive responses that require partnership between
researchers, farmers and extension workers.

6.5.1 Zero tillage
Zero tillage breaks with the traditional technique of
ploughing the soil and consists of simply planting a
new crop over the dead leaves and vegetation left after
harvesting the previous crop. The use of zero tillage
(sometimes called direct seeding or conservation
agriculture) offers signiÔ¨Åcant beneÔ¨Åts for developing
countries‚Äô agriculture as it can help avoid soil loss from
erosion. Zero tillage is being used on over 25 million
hectares of farmland in Brazil and other Mercosur
countries have reached signiÔ¨Åcant achievements in
yields using this technique. Expectations are that 85
per cent of the soybean cropped in the region will
be produced under zero tillage. India and Pakistan
are beneÔ¨Åting from the Brazilian and Mercosur
experiences after adapting it to tropical and subtropical
conditions.

6.5.2 BeneÔ¨Åcial biological organisms
Soil microorganisms can help plants to absorb
nutrients. The utility of these microorganisms can be
enhanced by selecting the most efÔ¨Åcient, culturing
them and adding them to soils directly or through
seeds. The cultured microorganisms packed in carrier
material (such as peat or lignite powder) for easy
application in the Ô¨Åeld are called bio-fertilizers.
Although Green Revolution crops achieve their
maximum yields with high chemical fertilizer inputs,
it is still proÔ¨Åtable to grow them without any nitrogen
fertilizer ‚Äì an attractive option for poor farmers who
cannot afford such inputs. Green Revolution crops
grown under these conditions (and outyielding
traditional varieties that use no nitrogen fertilizer) must

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2010

be receiving nutrients from non-chemical sources in
the soil. Biofertilizers could help reinforce these natural
nutrient sources. For example, Azolla prinnata (a water
fern) has a symbiotic association with the blue-green
algae (BGA) Anabaena, and can Ô¨Åx atmospheric
nitrogen. Ploughed into the soil between rice harvests,
it can increase the crop yield by over 50 per cent and
its effect, which lasts for two years, is equivalent to the
use of 60 kg of nitrogen fertilizer per hectare. BGA can
Ô¨Åx up to 77 kg of nitrogen per hectare in a cropping
season under non-symbiotic conditions. In symbiosis
with Azolla, the amount Ô¨Åxed can reach 425 kg of
nitrogen per hectare in 100 days.200
It is important to encourage farmers to rely more
extensively on organic or bio-fertilizer (which is
much less costly), mixed cropping (which helps
preserve soil fertility). In some cases this may require
government intervention to better regulate fertilizer
markets to ensure supply, quality and affordable
prices. Elimination or reduction of chemical fertilizer
dependency with the use of biofertilizers would
drastically reduce production costs at the farm level.
Chemical fertilizers account for some 60 per cent of
the energy costs of wheat production in India.201

6.6 BIOTECHNOLOGY
6.6.1 Tissue culture and
micropropagation
The plant tissue culture technique has already been
mastered in many developing countries and is the most
commonly applied form of biotechnology in Africa.
The technique requires a sterile workplace, a nursery/
greenhouse, and trained manpower. It is an important
technology for the production of disease-free, highquality planting material and the rapid production of
many uniform plants. Plant cells, tissues, or organs
are cultivated on specially formulated nutrient media
under the right conditions to regenerate an entire
plant from a single cell. The downside is that tissue
culture is labour-intensive, time-consuming, and can
be costly. Plants that have been grown in tissue culture
and are important to developing countries include oil
palm, coffee, pine, banana, date, eggplant, jojoba,
pineapple, rubber tree, cassava, yam, sweet potato
and tomato.202
The single most important factor that contributed to
greater labour use per hectare in Green Revolution
areas was the practice of multiple cropping facilitated

beneÔ¨Åts such as improved appearance, taste and
nutritional quality, drought tolerance, and insect and
disease resistance. The most common trait being
introduced into GM crops is herbicide tolerance; this
trait is now found in about 80 per cent of all GM crops
planted worldwide.

by early-maturing varieties of cereals. The application
of micropropagation techniques to potato could
similarly help improve cropping intensity. Since
potatoes take only 40-90 days to grow in the climates
of most developing countries (compared to 150 days
in temperate climates), they can easily be incorporated
into the cropping patterns currently practised for
cereals such as wheat, rice and corn.

Sorghum is the second food crop from the grass
family after rice to have its genome fully sequenced.
Combining the new knowledge on the sorghum
genome sequence with expertise on molecular-marker
assisted crop selection and breeding could result in
the development of improved sorghum varieties and
hybrids with improved drought tolerance or disease
resistance. Up until now, the biotechnology option has
focused on just a few crops: soya beans and maize
(primarily used for animal feed), cotton and canola
(oilseed rape). Soya beans‚Äô share of the total GM crop
area is the highest and was growing most rapidly until
recently, when the shares of GM maize and GM cotton
areas also expanded (as seen in Figure 19).

Thirty developing countries already have the capacity
to micropropagate potatoes. The crop is a major
source of food for poor families in Africa, and some
Asian countries such as India, Sri Lanka and the
Philippines. Indeed, micropropagation techniques
have made potatoes the second-biggest crop (by
weight) after rice in Vietnam, and have quadrupled
their production in China over the past thirty years.203

6.7 COMBATING CROP DISEASES
Bananas and plantains, which feed about 100 million
people in sub-Saharan Africa, are threatened by
pests and diseases that are cutting yields across
the continent, in some cases by 50 per cent or more.
Bananas are particularly susceptible to signiÔ¨Åcant
pest and disease build-ups because they grow
directly from ‚Äòmother plants‚Äô and not from seeds.
Farmers may not be aware of infected cuttings from
banana plants when they replant, sell or exchange
them with fellow growers, thus unwittingly spreading
disease. For example, in Uganda, which harvests
10 million tons of East African highland cooking
bananas a year (making it the world‚Äôs second-largest
banana producer after India), was hit by bacterial wilt
(Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris) in 2001.
This has now spread to Rwanda, the United Republic
of Tanzania, Kenya, and Congo, and is suspected to
have reached Burundi. Bacterial wilt causes banana
leaves of infected plants to turn yellow and drip a
yellowish Ô¨Çuid. The bananas ripen prematurely and rot
away.
The main diseases affecting cassava in Africa are
cassava mosaic disease, cassava bacterial blight,
cassava anthracnose disease, and root rot. The
major pests are the cassava green mite, the cassava
mealybug, and the variegated grasshopper. These
combined with poor farming systems cause yield
losses that may be as high as 50 per cent. IITA found
that a new disease affecting the cassava crop ‚Äì the
Cassava Brown Streak Virus ‚Äì has spread from the
United Republic of Tanzania to Kenya, Rwanda,
Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Uganda,
supported by a whiteÔ¨Çy vector (bemisia tabaci) which
is predominant in East Africa and could negatively
affect food security in the region. Of the 172 million
tons of cassava produced globally in 2000, Africa
accounted for 54 per cent,, with Nigeria the world‚Äôs
largest producer. Research to understand the virus
and to develop resistant varieties is underway in
Uganda.
One of the most devastating diseases in rice is blight,
caused by bacteria common throughout Asia and
Africa. The bacteria, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. Oryzae,
spreads rapidly from rice plant to rice plant and from
Ô¨Åeld to Ô¨Åeld in water droplets. Infected leaves develop
lesions, yellow and wilt in a matter of days. In severely
infected Ô¨Åelds, bacterial blight can wipe out half of a
farmer‚Äôs rice crop. The farmer‚Äôs predicament is that all

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2010

rice plants are vulnerable to some diseases more than
others. Breeders have exploited disease-resistance
genes in rice for nearly a century, redistributing this
genetic wealth from hardy species to agriculturally
useful varieties.205
As trade and commerce of agricultural products
increases so does the risk of new diseases entering a
country. Furthermore, existing pathogens can always
adapt, or new pathogens can be introduced. Many
developing countries are having to make choices
about how best to allocate limited resources to the
many potential uses in the broad Ô¨Åeld of sanitary
and phytosanitary (SPS) control. SPS standards and
monitoring is an important issue in the global trade of
high-value perishable products. Such standards enable
the effective management of risks associated with the
spread of plant and animal pests and diseases and
the incidence of microbial pathogens or contaminants
in food. The development of SPS control mechanisms
in developing countries is still in its infancy.

6.7.1 Herbicides and pesticides
The inability to control weeds is an important factor in
stiÔ¨Çing crop growth and yields. In sub-Saharan Africa,
millions of labour hours are wasted, especially by
women, who are often subjected to this backbreaking
work. Weeding for Green Revolution crops was also
the most labour-intensive of all agricultural operations.
Even with a prodigious amount of labour, African
farmers still lose 25 to 100 per cent of their crop yields
to competition from weeds.206
Proponents of organic farming are encouraging the
use of natural, non-toxic and environmentally friendly
forms of pest control. Unfortunately, very few herbicide
alternatives have been developed, and fewer still
match the productivity and economic advantages of
chemical herbicides, thereby resulting in a competitive
disadvantage for organic farmers. Nonetheless,
organic produce can yield higher incomes as organic
food often commands a price premium. This is
however only true in developed countries where a
critical mass of consumers can afford such premiums.
These premiums are not to be had in Africa.
In addition, manual weeding provides a major source
of agricultural employment and cash income for hired
labour, including women from the poorest households.
Increased use of herbicides could therefore have
negative socio-economic impacts for these labourers
and their families.

CHAPTER VI : TECHNOLOGY MIXES FOR SMALL-SCALE FARMING

In the United States, advances in sophisticated Global
Positioning Systems allow farmers to apply speciÔ¨Åcally
designed plans for spraying herbicides and pesticides.
Additionally, weed detectors equipped with infrared
light identify speciÔ¨Åc plants by the different rates of
light they reÔ¨Çect and then send signals to a pump to
spray a preset amount of herbicide onto the weed,
reducing the amount spent on herbicides.207

6.8 POST-HARVEST
TECHNOLOGIES
6.8.1 Reducing post-harvest losses and
enhancing shelf life
Studies show post-harvest losses of cereals in
developing countries are between 10 and 20 per
cent, with even higher losses (up to 100 per cent)
for fruit and vegetables. These sizeable losses could
offset any signiÔ¨Åcant investment made in raising
productivity. Crop losses could be reduced and the
world food supply increased by between 10 and 30
per cent through the application of readily available
technologies and input management using minimal
additional resources. Efforts to improve Africa‚Äôs
traditional post-harvest technologies have had mixed
results. ModiÔ¨Åcations to one post-harvest activity may
have serious effects on other operations, thus affecting
the equilibrium of the system. For example, while new
high-yielding varieties increase production, they may
create new problems in terms of handling and storage
of larger volumes of grain. Mechanical threshing
leads farmers to store grain rather than unthreshed
ears, making them potentially more susceptible to
insect attack. Traditionally, farmers used various types
of natural insecticides of either vegetable or mineral
origin to preserve their grain from insect attack.
Certain advanced products, if not properly used, can
have serious negative consequences on the health of
farmers or consumers.
Some of Africa‚Äôs staple crops, such as cassava,
are bulky, perishable and cannot be traded without
signiÔ¨Åcant processing or value-added. This results in
some striking disparities. For instance Nigeria is the
world‚Äôs largest cassava producer but accounts for
zero per cent of global exports while Thailand, which
accounts for only 10 per cent of global production,
commands 80 per cent of the global trade in the
crop. The same can be said of Uganda, which is
the second-largest producer of bananas after India

83

but ranks 75th in terms of exports.208 Developing
post-harvest technologies and innovation therefore
provides considerable opportunities for food security,
trade and economic growth.

6.8.2 Adding value for perishable
products
Well over Ô¨Åve million people, most of them among the
poorest people in Africa, depend on the cultivation of
tropical root and tuber crops such as cassava, sweet
potato, yam and cocoyam. These crops are also
perishable. Processing cassava and other root and
tuber crops is necessary to increase their shelf life,
which could contribute considerably to transforming
local economies. Overcoming the perishability of the
crops, enhancing their nutritional value and adding
additional economic value locally through agricultural
processing is one important way to increasing food
security in Africa.
Agro-industries in many developing countries play a
minimal role in economic development. Less than 20
per cent of agricultural output undergoes industrial
processing, compared with 80 per cent or more in
developed countries. Appropriate technologies for
processing cereals, legumes, roots and tubers into
Ô¨Çours that serve as indigenous convenience foods
in the rural areas of many developing countries are
necessary to upgrade traditional food technologies,
enabling them to enhance the shelf life and
acceptability to consumer of indigenous foods, as
well as to develop value-added products with export
potential. An FAO compendium of traditional food
processing technologies in Africa aims to support
the establishment of small-scale, low-capital input
installations for food preservation in rural and periurban areas.
Technologies for processing roots and tubers could
expand these crops‚Äô roles as sources of both food
and income. A wide range of existing food processing
technologies could be made accessible to, and
adapted by farming communities, by promoting
research to identify, develop and promote diffusion
of relevant technologies to reduce post-harvest food
loss, with an initial emphasis on crops. It might be
useful to focus on conducting an inventory of current
technologies and practices for reducing post-harvest
food loss.

84

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2010

6.8.3 Post-harvest technologies
The main post-harvest technologies can be classiÔ¨Åed
into primary and secondary processing technologies.
The primary processing of agricultural produce
involves cleaning, grading, packaging, drying, precooling, storage, etc. It is often poorly developed
in rural areas compared to secondary processing
industries such as Ô¨Çour mills, sugar mills and oil mills.
The key low-cost technologies with the potential to
raise income and generate employment opportunities
in rural areas include:
‚Ä¢ Seed/grain drying, aeration and storage
technology;
‚Ä¢ Rice drying technology for obtaining higher head
rice yield;
‚Ä¢ EfÔ¨Åcient processing technology for pulses;
‚Ä¢ Rice par-boiling technology;
‚Ä¢ ModiÔ¨Åed atmosphere and pre-cooling technology;
‚Ä¢ Cool stores for potatoes; and
‚Ä¢ Cleaning, grading, and packing technology.
The development and adoption of technologies to
reduce post-harvest losses will help generate income
and employment opportunities for rural farmers.
The greatest potential lies in primary processing
technologies. Developing countries need to establish
educational institutions with the responsibility to train
people in the Ô¨Åeld of post-harvest engineering and
management and to develop and adopt post-harvest
technologies suitable to local conditions.

6.8.4 Development and dissemination of
post-harvest technologies
Post-harvest losses reÔ¨Çect underinvestment in the
value chain and innovation. It is best for all stakeholders
involved in the value chain to understand the causes
of such losses before deciding on measures to reduce
them. All participants in the food system must have
reliable access to appropriate post-harvest techniques
and technologies to improve quality, throughput,
labour and time efÔ¨Åciencies, and, at the same time,
add value and enhance the competitiveness of fresh
and processed produce and their by-products.
This could be achieved in part by developing and
disseminating post-harvest technologies to improve
food security and strengthen the competitiveness of
small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) by reducing
post-harvest losses and improving the marketability

of smallholder produce. For subsistence farmers, the
uptake of innovative post-harvest technologies and
techniques can be enhanced by training the end-users
in the application and improvement of these tools. A
technology needs assessment should help identify the
tools and policies to foster adoption of post-harvest
technologies that enable smallholders to reduce postharvest wastage and by-product contamination of air
and water, and allow commercial farmers to capitalize
on opportunities to access new and existing markets
while improving competitiveness and adhering to food
quality and safety standards. This would strengthen
the long-term sustainability of remote communities by
improving rural enterprises.
The preferred technologies for rural storage are those
that use locally available construction materials and
involve building designs that reÔ¨Çect social and cultural
traditions but also harness scientiÔ¨Åc research and
development in agricultural engineering that fosters
optimum utilization of available human, Ô¨Ånancial and
physical resources. In most developing countries this
means promoting applied rather than basic research,
with a strong emphasis on direct farmer participation.

6.8.5 Methodologies to choose
technologies
The modernization of agriculture must not be
understood merely as the acquisition of high
technologies at high prices: a package that may not
address the real development needs of African farmers.
The technologies suitable to Africa‚Äôs farming systems
can be selected on the basis of two approaches: the
ecological approach and the agro-ecological zone
approach.
The ecological approach, illustrated in Figure 20, is
centrally concerned with identifying constraints and
opportunities for system-speciÔ¨Åc improvement. It
distinguishes the critical factors that determine, limit or
reduce crop growth and yields. These factors include
the genetic potential of the plant, the availability of water
and nutrients, and the occurrence of weeds, pests,
and diseases in agricultural-production systems. This
approach allows for more comprehensive identiÔ¨Åcation
and prioritization of the agro-ecological constraints to
yield growth and helps reduce post-harvest losses,
while helping to identify and map existing technological
opportunities for improvement.
For example, research using the production ecological
approach in the 1970s revealed that agricultural

CHAPTER VI : TECHNOLOGY MIXES FOR SMALL-SCALE FARMING

Box 8: Types of farming system in Africa210
Farming systems in Africa can be divided into two major groups: traditional subsistence and improved farming systems.
In traditional subsistence farming, the farmer‚Äôs objective is to grow enough food for on-farm consumption only. In Africa,
there are still two types of subsistence farming: shifting subsistence farming and intensive subsistence farming. In a
shifting cultivation system, a farmer clears a piece of land from bush fallow using traditional methods of slash-and-burn,
and then cultivates it. When the soils are exhausted after three to Ô¨Åve years, the farmer abandons the plot and moves to
another piece of land. The abandoned plot is left to bush fallow for two to three years.
However, when there is high population pressure on the land, the individual farmer has no alternative land to move to. The
farmer is forced to cultivate permanently in one location, using the intensive subsistence farming system.
Some types of improved farming systems also exist in Africa. Examples include: (a) improved farming systems under
irrigation (such as the Gezira irrigation scheme in Sudan; (b) improved intensive farming systems by smallholders as in
the Uboma district in Imo State, East Nigeria; and (c) improved (commercial) farming on large estates such as the settlers
in Zimbabwe. In all theses aspects of improved farming systems, there are some improved methods especially for maintaining soil fertility and land productivity. Under improved commercial farming, the objective is to specialize in producing
food, non-food crops and animal products for sale while maximizing proÔ¨Åts.211

production in the Sahelian region was limited by
drought and by poor soil fertility. This pointed to the
need to invest in, and develop, drought- and pestresistant crops and to enhance soil fertility.
The ecological zone approach is based on the speciÔ¨Åc
ecological zone where farming takes place, and aims to
increase the choices and options available to farmers
and enhance their ability to adapt to challenges such
as erratic rainfall and climate change.
In this regard, each ecological zone dictates a range
of possible farming systems. This could be a mixture
of traditional and modern production systems.
Technologies can be chosen according to their
adaptability to the type of agro-ecological zone. Box
8 summarizes the main types of farming system seen
in Africa.

The technologies reviewed in this report tend to
be those that are suitable to drylands and areas of
uncertain rainfall, since these lands account for 90
per cent of agricultural production in developing
countries. Drylands are particularly important in Africa
as they are home to over 500 million people in an area
of some 3400 million hectares, covering the Sudan
savannah, the Sahelian savannah, the Mediterranean
and the deserts (see Table 10). These drylands are
characterized by light, erratic rainfall of less than
500 mm/yr.
It is important to realize that each technological
component undergoes three phases before it can
be commercialized or absorbed by end-users. First,
there is the technology generation and development
phase, carried out through basic research on research
stations and agriculture institutions. This is followed by

The FAO Knowledge Forum-Best Practices guide for
Conservation Farming is a good example of the way
modern scientiÔ¨Åc understanding is able to modify
traditional farming systems to achieve improvements
in both yield and ecological sustainability. Achieving
an ecological balance that encourages biodiversity
and eliminates pollution will require a strong grasp of
all categories of technology, in an effort to make wellinformed, holistic decisions on which technologies to
acquire.
The requisite knowledge, products and methods for
stimulating a massive hike in smallholder productivity
is well established; it must not be assumed that only
the very latest high-tech GMO technology can assure
success. When considering the technology transfer
requirements for a developing country, it is essential to
think about more than just high-technology solutions
and explore medium- and low-tech solutions that may
be better suited to deliver substantial improvements
in yield. Indeed an immense list of solutions is
already available, so the initial challenge is to isolate
the very best opportunities and to provide individual
dissemination paths for each of the ‚Äòsolutions‚Äô. Box
9 gives some examples of high-, medium- and lowtech solutions. The optimal mixture of solutions might
include a combination of both high-tech and more
traditional inputs, tools and techniques, driven by a
strategy focused on achieving maximum positive
impact within the prevailing constraints.

Box 9: Examples of technology solutions213
Below are three descriptions and examples of technologies that could be more widely explored.
‚ÄòHigh-tech‚Äô solutions are typically characterized by big-budget commercial or university research discoveries or inventions.
Although GMO seed technology (or DNA-informed ‚Äòsmart breeding‚Äô of non-GMO crops) is the most obvious example,
an array of other types of technology is also available, particularly from the chemical and bio-chemical research stable.
Given their technical complexity and regulatory aspects, modern pesticides and herbicides might also be included in this
category. The physical science arena also has much to offer, particularly Information and Communication Technologies
(ICT) capable of providing major beneÔ¨Åts in training and education, improved distribution, accelerated market development and social/business networking.
‚ÄòMedium-tech‚Äô solutions are generally more mature technologies which form the backbone of conventional (post-Green
Revolution) agriculture. This might include improved (non-GMO) seed varieties using conventional plant breeding/hybridization, the use of fertilizers, the efÔ¨Åcient use of machinery, small- to medium-scale integrated water resource projects,
etc.
Natural Ô¨Åxation of nitrogen: an example of medium technology
This technique has a massive environmental and economic impact and has been widely used in a number of countries in
the world. Soybeans in Brazil are inoculated with highly active bacteria (Bradyrizhobium) that Ô¨Åxate nitrogen from the air
into the soil. The technology reduces the impact of the large-scale use of fertilizers on soil and groundwater. Moreover,
it contributes to the mitigation of climate change, since it contributes to reducing to zero the use of nitrogen on over 13
million hectares in Brazil. Last but not least, the techniques results in a total saving of $3.0 billion per year.
‚ÄòLow-tech‚Äô solutions are deÔ¨Åned as simpler tools and techniques that may include modern best practice guidelines, or

CHAPTER VI : TECHNOLOGY MIXES FOR SMALL-SCALE FARMING

87

improved tools or devices that may have existed prior to the Green Revolution. Examples include agro-well construction,
improved water harvesting and drip irrigation, intelligent planting schemes, integrated pest control, the use of animals
and organic fertilizer, strategies for reducing post-harvest losses, etc.
Biological control of soybean caterpillar: an example of low technology
The caterpillar of soybean crops causes important reductions in productivity and control is affected mainly with pesticides
that, if misused, can damage the environment, biodiversity and human health. In the 1970s researchers at Embrapa, the
Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation discovered a virus that acts as a natural enemy of the caterpillar and could be
used as part of a very simple technique to biologically control the infestation. Researchers macerated virus-killed larvae
and diluted the resulting mass in water for spraying in the Ô¨Åelds. The technique was successfully implemented and is now
used on 2 million hectares of soybean crops in Brazil. As a result, since the beginning of the 1980s the use of over 16
million litres of pesticides has been avoided, saving nearly $350 million. The technique can be easily employed by small,
medium and large farmers. Embrapa has initiated projects with Kenya and the United Republic of Tanzania and other
countries in sub-Saharan Africa to deliver the technology. Their implementation remains to be seen.

6.9 SUMMARY
A wide range of production and post-harvest
technologies are currently available for a wider range
of crops than during those which were the subject of
the Green Revolution. There is also a better (but still
incomplete) understanding of the context and factors
that determine technology adoption, diffusion and
impact. As research is moving towards ‚Äòprecision
agriculture‚Äô, efforts to build an enabling environment
need to incorporate an understanding of contextual
factors, and should incorporate efforts to utilize
farmers‚Äô innovative capacity.
Local agro-ecological conditions play a vital role in
shaping the overall technology acquisition strategy,
which in turn requires close relationships with local
grassroots initiatives coordinated by extension
services, NGOs and private enterprise at the district
level. Issues of sustainability (particularly in terms of
water and energy use) are a major consideration in the
choice of technologies, and must take centre-stage
when discussing all aspects of technology adoption.
The urgent need for improvement underlines the
importance of adopting and diffusing existing
technologies as a matter of priority, and ensuring
that public and private partnerships work toward

the development, dissemination and adoption of
technologies. Opportunities to reduce crop losses
can be realized when farmers, processors and traders
have access to reliable information and appropriate
techniques and technologies to improve quality,
throughput, labour and time efÔ¨Åciencies.
Technology needs assessments should identify
gaps in technology, infrastructure or information in
order to better facilitate the deployment and use of
technologies that reduce post-harvest losses of
smallholder rural produce.
In the future, climate change will render the need
for new agricultural technologies more important
for strongly affected parts of Africa. There is a need
for: (a) increased agricultural R&D that is relevant to
African agro-ecological conditions; (b) much stronger
innovation capabilities among African institutions and
smallholder farmers; (c) promotion of new techniques
and technologies; and (d) training end-users in their
application and improvement.
This chapter has outlined the main types of technologies
used in agriculture and provided guidelines on how
agricultural technologies could be selected that
will be most useful for smallholder African farmers.
These technologies all exist and can be transferred to
smallholder farmers through technology transfer.

7
RECOMMENDATIONS

90

This Ô¨Ånal chapter recaps the main issues and solutions
discussed in the report and proposes a set of fourteen
priority recommendations for policy-makers in Africa
(and other regions, including developed countries) for
action to support agricultural research and development
in Africa, with a view to raising productivity, improving
human wellbeing and strengthening food security.
Most of the recommendations are for national-level
interventions though there is also a strong need for
coordination between countries in sub-Saharan Africa
and beyond.
With these recommendations, the report corroborates
the opinion that when looking for solutions for
agriculture development and food security, there
is no one monolithic group with the same needs,
challenges, and skill sets. As such solutions will
need to avoid the ‚Äòone-size-Ô¨Åts-all‚Äô prescriptions that
according to UNCTAD have been so damaging to
development in recent years. A single overarching
message to solve the food security problem should
be distrusted. The solutions lie in hundreds of fronts
and will be slow and technocratic rather than quick
and spectacular.214 Actors or agents operating in
the agriculture innovation system include individuals
such as farmers, enterprise owners, and engineers/
scientists; and organizations including enterprises
universities and Ô¨Årms, R&D departments, Ô¨Ånancial
institutions such as development banks, and
intermediary organisations such as seed banks and
providers of extension services, such as marketing
boards, cooperatives among others. The knowledge
base of African agricultural systems of innovation
is more dispersed than what we know wfrom our
experiences of studying agricultural innovation
systems from industrialized and other developing
countries, and the organisations that play the critical
role in applying existing knowledge or generating new
knowledge through learning activities are in the public
sector. The private sector is conspicuous largely by its
absence, rather than for its proven ability for product
development as is the case in the industrialized
countries. The market for agricultural products is
severely fragmented in African countries and this
stunts advance that require demand and supply side
coordination. The absence of linkages between the key
actors not only prevents the ability of the agricultural
system to use available knowledge to innovate and
respond to local demand, but it also stymies its ability
to be resilient in the face of external shocks, such as
that posed by the global food crisis

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2010

(a) Place smallholder farmers at the centre of
policy
Policies must be oriented towards ensuring that
agricultural research, development and extension
services meet the real needs of small-scale farmers who
represent the majority of farmers in most developing
countries. Policies must also seek to strengthen the
competitiveness of small-holder farmers thus avoiding
a rural exodus that would put pressure on the cities
and lead to more food imports, thereby perpetuating
the negative trade balance in agriculture and turning
yet more African countries into net food importers. In
addition, the intricacies of the labour and production
processes and the socio-economic determinants of
the status of female labour have to be understood,
and imperfections in the rural factor markets removed
through a combination of policy measures, structural
changes and bold institutional reforms, if modern
technologies and innovations are to be adopted by
smallholder farmers.

(b) Strengthen policymaking capacities
Given the key role that policy-makers play in creating
an enabling environment for agricultural innovation,
it is essential that these stakeholders are adequately
informed and prepared for the task. Promoting the
sharing of policy-makers‚Äô experiences and relevant
knowledge Ô¨Çows at the national and international level
is a good place to start. There also needs to be a
strong level of political will and international support, as
well as some degree of experimentation in designing
public policies, to Ô¨Ånd what works best.

(c) Target agricultural investment
Because Ô¨Ånancial resources are severely stretched in
most African countries, policy-makers need to target
investments carefully, putting resources into areas that
are most likely to have a large impact on increasing
physical and scientiÔ¨Åc infrastructure, linkages and
greater investment into extension services that could
lead to improving national food security. Nevertheless,
there is also a need for African countries to increase
their overall investment in agricultural development.
Greater international support is crucial.

CHAPTER VI I : RECOMMENDATIONS

91

(d) Reinforce agricultural innovation systems
by focusing on the enabling environment

(f) Explore the potential of global networks and
value chains

Consciously creating an enabling environment for
agricultural innovation is an imperative for African
countries in order to promote sustainable agricultural
development. Key aspects of an enabling environment
that policy-makers would need to address include:
(a) the role of private markets to produce optimum
levels of public goods, including agricultural research;
(b) the Wexternalities of technology use that call for
regulatory frameworks, such as biosafety; (c) the role of
external rules and norms, such as intellectual property
protection on the development of local capabilities;
and (d) the market weaknesses in African countries
that lead to high transaction costs in establishing userproducer networks. These require public investment
in research, regulation and institutional capacity
development to foster growth.

Supporting smallholder farmers in joining sub-regional,
regional or global networks and value chains will help
provide them with access to international markets
and to inputs, Ô¨Ånance and technology. It may well be
useful to start with a value chain analysis to identify the
opportunities for improvement. As mentioned earlier in
the report, efforts to support links to value chains can
be supported by the following activities: (a) actively
increasing market efÔ¨Åciencies and access, especially
to the markets for high value-added agricultural
exports, including processed agricultural exports;
(b) putting in place marketing information systems;
and (c) designing and implementing trade facilitation
programmes. However, the real challenge that remains
is one of matching such supply led approaches by
demand-led ones. Strong productivity and (real)
income growth which is key for industrialization of
countries,215 however, derives mainly from the ability to
achieve scale economies in production, specialization
and technological learning on the supply side; and on
the demand side, the ability to respond to demand.216
Precisely because of this, such approaches need
to be complemented by the building of productive
capacities in African agriculture systems.

(e) Take into account local agro-ecological
conditions
African agriculture is tremendously diverse, and
any single, Africa-wide strategy for agricultural
transformation (e.g., based on an Asian-style Green
Revolution) is unlikely to be successful. Technologies
should be tailored to different agro-ecological zones
and include appropriate and effective mixes both
of low-, medium- and high-tech solutions as well as
traditional knowledge and modern science. Within
African‚Äôs six broad agro-ecological zones, further
disaggregation is necessary, based on local sociopolitical and agro-ecological conditions. Developing
appropriate disaggregation and speciÔ¨Åc strategies
for each zone is a key challenge for National
Agricultural Research System (NARS). There is a
need to strengthen NARS (typically the weak link in
the research system in Africa), as international and
regional research systems are unlikely to carry out the
disaggregated research needed to tailor innovations
to local areas. SpeciÔ¨Åc attention must be given to
rainfed agriculture as it is, and will continue to be,
the dominant system in Africa for several decades to
come. Ecological synergies including drought-tolerant
cultivars should be exploited to take full advantage of
the new breeding methods.

(g) Link national, regional and international
agriculture research to innovation
One important lesson learnt from the evolution of
the Green Revolution technology in Asia is that
International Agricultural Research Centres (IARCs)
should cooperate in developing improved crop
varieties. Research collaboration between IARC and
NARS has to be strengthened and intensiÔ¨Åed. The
success of collaborative activities depends much on
the existence of national capabilities and institutional
infrastructure for testing, adapting and disseminating
technology prototypes shared among participating
countries. Sub-regional cooperation can help address
capability and Ô¨Ånancing shortages as well as scarcity
of scientiÔ¨Åc laboratory equipment. African countries
need to engage in greater partnership nationally,
regionally and internationally that focuses on the
needs of their agricultural systems.

(h) Revitalize funding and strategies
research and development

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2010

for

There is an immediate need to reverse the
declining trend in funding for agricultural research
and development (R&D). The priority here is to
revitalize the domestic and internationally-supported
agricultural R&D activities by substantially increasing
the investment in agricultural R&D as percentage of
GDP and to decrease donor dependency. A greater
share of the overall ODA funds should be allocated
to agricultural investments to augment enhanced, but
limited, national resources available for this purpose
in order to enhance the capabilities of African National
Agricultural Research Systems (NARS) to undertake
adaptive research.

(i) Promote Linkages Within and Outside of the
Agriculture Innovation System
Four kinds of linkages are critical to enable
this transition: linkages between scientists and
practitioners, including farmers within the agricultural
innovation system; horizontal linkages between
farmers and extension services, linkages between
farmers and global networks and value chains and
linkages between farming and non-farming systems.
The speciÔ¨Åc policies needed at the national level
will depend on existing capabilities and human and
Ô¨Ånancial resources, the political, social and institutional
contexts and agro-ecological conditions.

(j) Engage in capacity building
Capacity-building policies and programmes for
science and technology should be assessed to
ensure that they work in support of public policy
objectives as an integral part of national and regional
policies. There is a need for an agreement among
African countries on a common underlying vision
for capacity building to provide sustainable capacity
support for speciÔ¨Åc needs of the agriculture sector
at various levels. At a national level, assessing local
technological competence to overcome weaknesses
would serve a valuable function to assess capacity
needs. It is also necessary to mainstream science and
technology policy by, for example: (a) strengthening
linkages and understanding between the scientiÔ¨Åc and
policy-making communities; (b) enhancing capacities
needed to articulate and assess policy choices
and options related to science and technology; (c)

focusing capacity-building strategies towards longterm education programmes through universities
and strategically selected on-farm activities; and
(d) developing a critical mass of experts at all levels
through organized long-term training, both formal and
informal.

(k) International cooperation on technology
transfer and technology sharing
African governments must take the lead in cooperating
to advance technology transfer within the region.
There are already numerous examples of how SouthSouth cooperation and triangular cooperation have
helped ensure the right technological tools are made
available to African farmers. South-South cooperation
also offers an important catalyst for addressing issues
of productivity at bilateral, regional and interregional
levels among developing countries and building food
security. Such cooperation can include exchange
of best practices, technologies and technicians on
agricultural production. It can be undertaken within the
framework of sub-regional or regional organizations
of developing countries through dedicated agriculture
and food sector development programmes and trade
programmes

(l) Multilateral rule-making and policy space
Policies over the past 30 years that led to the
withdrawal of governments from agricultural markets,
the dismantling of marketing boards and deregulation
of markets for agricultural inputs and outputs (in many
cases accompanied by a shift in resources from
food production for the domestic market to export
crops) have not been successful in creating dynamic
agricultural systems and strong productive capacities
by smallholder farmers in Africa. Multilateral, national
and regional technology policies must be an important
element when crafting trade rules in the WTO and
other multilateral fora. Intellectual property issues are
generally less pertinent to smallholders than larger
commercial farmers, but the issues that may arise
for them merit investigation. Adequate policy space
especially in relation to international rule-making is
necessary to address and implement some critical
policies in these areas.
