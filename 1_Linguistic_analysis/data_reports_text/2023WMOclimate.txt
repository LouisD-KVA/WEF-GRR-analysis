Key messages
2023 was the warmest year on record at 1.45 ± 0.12 °C above the pre-industrial
average.
Concentrations of the three main greenhouse gases – carbon dioxide,
methane and nitrous oxide – reached record-high observed levels in
2022. Real-time data show that levels continued to increase in 2023.
Ocean heat content reached its highest level in the 65-year
observational record.
Global mean sea level reached a record high. The rate of
sea-level rise in the past 10 years (2014–2023) has more
than doubled since the first decade of the satellite record
(1993–2002).
Antarctic sea-ice extent reached an absolute record
low in February. The annual maximum extent was
about 1 million km2 below the previous record low
maximum.
Preliminary data from the global set of reference
glaciers for the hydrological year 2022–2023 show they
experienced the largest loss of ice on record (1950–
2023), driven by extremely negative mass balance in
both western North America and Europe.
Glaciers in Switzerland have lost about 10% of their
remaining volume in the past two years.
Extreme weather continued to lead to severe socioeconomic
impacts. Extreme heat affected many parts of the world.
Wildfires in Canada, Europe and Hawaii (United States of
America) led to loss of life, the destruction of homes and
large-scale air pollution. Flooding associated with extreme
rainfall from Mediterranean Cyclone Daniel affected Greece,
Bulgaria, Türkiye and Libya, with particularly heavy loss of life
in Libya.
Food security, population displacement and impacts on vulnerable
populations continued to be of mounting concern in 2023, with weather
and climate hazards exacerbating the situation in many parts of the world.

Foreword
The climate crisis is the defining challenge that
humanity faces.
The WMO State of the Global Climate 2023 report
confirms that the year 2023 broke every single
climate indicator.
It was by far the warmest year on record.
The global average temperature in 2023 was
1.45 ± 0.12 °C above the 1850–1900 average. Never
have we been so close – albeit on a temporary
basis – to the 1.5° C lower limit of the Paris
Agreement on climate change.
Concentrations of greenhouse gases continued
to rise. Ocean heat content and sea level reached
record observed highs, and the rate of increase is
accelerating. Antarctic sea-ice extent hit record
observed lows. Key glaciers suffered record losses.
Heatwaves, floods, droughts, wildfires and intense tropical cyclones wreaked havoc on
every continent and caused huge socioeconomic losses. There were particularly devastating
consequences for vulnerable populations, who suffered disproportionate impacts.
Extreme climate conditions exacerbated humanitarian crises, with millions experiencing acute
food insecurity and hundreds of thousands displaced from their homes.
WMO is committed to increasing collaboration with the international community to confront
the enormity of this challenge.
WMO and its Members are expanding life-saving early warning services to achieve the groundbreaking Early Warnings for All initiative. A new Global Greenhouse Gas Watch (GGGW) seeks
to provide scientifically based information for climate change mitigation. The transition to
renewable energy must be supported by tailor-made weather and climate services.
To succeed, it is imperative to leverage efforts across the entire value chain – from improving
climate data and monitoring to strengthening prediction and projections and building capacity.
We must make climate information more accessible and actionable to serve society.
I hope this report will raise awareness of the vital need to scale up the urgency and ambition
of climate action.
I take this opportunity to congratulate and thank the experts and lead authors who compiled
this report. I extend my gratitude to all the contributors, particularly to WMO Member National
Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs) and Regional Climate Centres (RCCs) and
United Nations agencies.

Global climate indicators
Global climate indicators provide an overview of changes in the climate system.1 The set of
interlinked physical indicators presented here connect the changing composition of the atmosphere
with changes in energy in the climate system and the response of land, ocean and ice.
Global climate indicators are based on a wide range of datasets that comprise data from multiple
observing systems, including satellites and in situ networks (for details on the datasets used
in the present publication, see Data set and methods).
Changes to the physical climate, measured in the present publication by key indicators, can
have cascading impacts on national development and progress towards the United Nations
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 2 For example, changes in the acidity or temperature
of the ocean can affect marine life, in turn potentially affecting coastal communities that may
depend on the local catch for their livelihood or food security. Nevertheless, climate science
has a critical role to play in facilitating sustainable development. As demonstrated by the
United in Science 2023 report, weather-, climate- and water-related sciences support the
achievement of many of the SDGs. 3 Recognizing the interconnections between climate and
development can therefore lead to synergistic action – an increasing necessity as the world
strays further from achieving both the SDGs and the Paris Agreement goals.4

BASELINES
Baselines are periods of time, usually spanning three decades or more, that are used as a
fixed benchmark with which current conditions can be compared. For scientific, policy and
practical reasons, several different baselines are used in the present publication, and these
are specified in the text and figures. Where possible, the most recent WMO climatological
standard normal, 1991–2020, is used for consistent reporting.
For some indicators, however, it is not possible to use the standard normal owing to a lack
of measurements during the early part of the period. There are also two specific exceptions.
First, for the global mean temperature time series – and only for the global mean series – a
reference period of 1850–1900 is used. This is the baseline used by Working Group I in its
contribution to the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC AR6 WG I) as a reference period for pre-industrial conditions and is relevant
for understanding progress in the context of the Paris Agreement. Secondly, greenhouse gas
concentrations can be estimated much further back in time using gas bubbles trapped in ice
cores. Therefore, the year 1750 is used in the present publication to represent pre-industrial
greenhouse gas concentrations.

Greenhouse gases

2

GREENHOUSE GASES
Concentrations of the three main greenhouse gases – carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide –
reached record-high observed levels in 2022, the latest year for which consolidated global values
are available (1984–2022). Real-time data from specific locations show that levels of the three main
greenhouse gases continued to increase in 2023.

Atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases reflect a balance among emissions from
human activities, natural sources and sinks. Increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the
atmosphere owing to human activities have been the major driver of climate change since
the Industrial Revolution. Global average mole fractions of greenhouse gases – referred
to in the present publication for simplicity as the “concentration” in the atmosphere – are
calculated from in situ observations made at multiple sites through the Global Atmosphere
Watch (GAW) Programme of WMO, and partner networks.
In 2022 – the latest year for which consolidated global figures are available – atmospheric
levels of greenhouse gases reached new observed highs (see Figure 1), with globally averaged
concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) at 417.9 ± 0.2 parts per million (ppm), methane (CH4) at
1 923 ± 2 parts per billion (ppb) and nitrous oxide (N2O) at 335.8 ± 0.1 ppb, respectively 150%,
264% and 124% of pre-industrial (1750) levels. The rate of increase in CH4 was the second
highest on record, after 2021, and the rate of increase in N2O was the highest on record. The
rate of increase in CO2 at 2.2 ppm was slightly below the 10-year average of 2.46 ppm yr-1.
CO2 growth rate is typically lower in years that start with La Niña, as 2022 did, and higher in
years that start with El Niño, as 2016 did.5 Real-time data from specific locations, including
Mauna Loa6 (Hawaii, United States of America) and Kennaook/Cape Grim7 (Tasmania, Australia)
indicate that levels of CO2, CH4 and N2O continued to increase in 2023.

TEMPERATURE
The global mean near-surface temperature in 2023 was 1.45 ± 0.12 °C above the 1850–1900 average.
2023 was the warmest year in the 174-year observational record, clearly surpassing the previous
joint warmest years, 2016 at 1.29 ± 0.12 °C above the 1850–1900 average and 2020 at 1.27 ± 0.13 °C.
The past nine years, 2015–2023, were the nine warmest years on record.
Record monthly global near-surface temperatures have been observed for the ocean – from April
through December – and, starting slightly later, the land – from July through November.
The 10-year average 2014–2023 global temperature was 1.20 ± 0.12 °C above the 1850–1900 average,
making it the warmest 10-year period on record.

Global mean near-surface temperature in 2023 was 1.45 ± 0.12 °C above the 1850–1900 average8
(see Figure 2). The analysis is based on a synthesis of six global temperature datasets (see
Data set and methods). 2023 was the warmest year in the 174-year instrumental record in each
of the six datasets. The past nine years – from 2015 to 2023 – were the nine warmest years on
record. The two previous warmest years were 2016, with an anomaly of 1.29 ± 0.12 °C, and
2020, with an anomaly of 1.27 ± 0.13 °C.
Globally, every month from June to December was record warm for the respective month.
September 2023 was particularly noteworthy, surpassing the previous global record for
September by a wide margin (0.46 °C–0.54 °C) in all datasets. The second-highest margin by
which a September record was broken in the past 60 years (the period covered by all datasets)
was substantially smaller, at 0.03 °C–0.17 °C in 1983. July is typically the warmest month of
the year globally, and thus July 2023 became the warmest month on record.
The long-term increase in global temperature is due to increased concentrations of greenhouse
gases in the atmosphere. The shift from La Niña, which lasted from mid-2020 to early 2023,
to fully developed El Niño conditions by September 2023 (see Short-term climate drivers)

likely explains some of the rise in temperature from 2022 to 2023. However, some areas of
unusual warming, such as the North-East Atlantic (see Figure 3) do not correspond to typical
patterns of warming or cooling associated with El Niño. Other factors, which are still being
investigated, may also have contributed to the exceptional warming from 2022 to 2023, which
is unlikely to be due to internal variability alone.9
The average global temperature over the past 10 years, from 2014 to 2023, was 1.20 ± 0.12 °C
above the 1850–1900 average, making the past 10 years the warmest among all 10-year periods
on record in all six datasets.
Between late spring in the northern hemisphere and the end of 2023, global average sea-surface
temperatures (SSTs) were also at a record observed high. The records for July, August and
September were each broken by a large margin (between 0.21 °C and 0.27 °C). Exceptional
warmth relative to the 1991–2020 baseline was recorded in the eastern North Atlantic, the
Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean, the North Pacific extending eastward from the Sea of
Japan, the Arabian Sea and large areas of the Southern Ocean (see Figure 3; see also Marine
heatwaves and cold spells).
Observed global land temperature anomalies reached record levels in July and August,
somewhat later than for SSTs, but the September average was also a record by a large
margin of 0.53 °C–0.71 °C. The second-widest margin by which a record has been broken
in the past 60 years was 0.22 °C–0.27 °C in September 2002. In 2023, most land areas were
warmer than the 1991–2020 average (see Figure 3). Unusual warmth was reported across
large areas of northern Canada, the southern United States of America, Mexico and Central
America, as well as large areas of South America. Large areas from Central Asia to western
Europe, including parts of North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, were also unusually warm,
as were South-East Asia and Japan.

OCEAN
Increasing human emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases cause a positive
radiative imbalance at the top of the atmosphere. This imbalance leads to the accumulation
of energy in the Earth system in the form of heat, which is driving global warming.10,11 The
ocean, which covers about 70% of the Earth’s surface, absorbs heat and CO2, which can act to
slow the rate of warming in the atmosphere. However, the heat absorbed by the ocean leads
to ocean warming, which, together with the melting of ice on land, raises sea levels, while
the absorption of CO2 leads to ocean acidification. Warming waters, sea-level rise and ocean
acidification all have significant effects on the ocean, as well as on the plants and animals
that live in it and the people who rely upon it for their livelihoods.

OCEAN HEAT CONTENT
In 2023, ocean heat content reached its highest level in the 65-year observational record.

About 90% of the energy that has accumulated in the Earth system since 1971 is stored in
the ocean. As energy has accumulated in the ocean, it has warmed, and global ocean heat
content has increased (see Figure 4).
According to a consolidated analysis based on several individual datasets, the upper 2 000 m
of the ocean continued to warm in 2023.12 IIt is expected that warming will continue – a change
that is irreversible on centennial to millennial timescales.13,14 Ocean heat content in 2023 was
the highest on record, exceeding the 2022 value by 13 ± 9 ZJ (see Figure 4)15 cconsistent with
estimates published in early 2024.16
All datasets agree that ocean warming rates show a particularly strong increase in the past
two decades. The rate of ocean warming for the 0–2 000 m layer was 0.7 ± 0.1 W m -2 from
1971 to 2023 on average, but 1.0 ± 0.1 W m-2 from 2005 to 2023 (the period covered by the
Argo programme). The steady increase in ocean warming rates17,18 is seen consistently in
direct estimates from in situ observations, indirect estimates from remote sensing and direct
estimates of the net flux at the top of the atmosphere as measured by satellites.19 Different
drivers of this change are discussed in literature, including a change in anthropogenic climate
forcing20 and natural variability.21 Deep-ocean global warming below 2 000 m depth is estimated
to be 0.07 ± 0.03 W m -2 from 1992 to 2022. 22

Although ocean heat content has increased strongly through the entire water column, the
rate of warming has not been the same everywhere. 23 The strongest warming in the upper
2 000 m occurred in the Southern Ocean (60° S–35° S), North Atlantic (20° N–50° N) and South
Atlantic (60° S–0° S) (see Figure 5). The Southern Ocean domain is the largest reservoir of
heat, accounting for about 32% of the global ocean heat content increase in the upper 2 000 m
since 1958. 24 The Atlantic Ocean accounts for approximately 31% of the global 0–2 000 m
ocean heat content increase, and the Pacific Ocean for about 26%.

reflecting continued ocean warming as well as the melting of glaciers and ice sheets
The rate of global mean sea-level rise in the past 10 years (2014–2023) is more than twice the rate
of sea-level rise in the first decade of the satellite record (1993–2002).

From January to March 2023, sea levels (see Figure 7)
were higher than the long-term average (1993–2012)
in the western tropical Pacific. This is characteristic of
warm seawater in the region associated with El Niño–
Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-neutral conditions. Sea
levels in the North Atlantic and eastern tropical Pacific
were lower than the long-term average. Warming of

Sea level (mm)

Global mean sea level (GMSL) continued to rise in
2023 (see Figure 6). The La Niña conditions between
mid-2020 and early 2023 had only a small apparent
effect on GMSL, unlike the 2011 La Niña, which led to
a temporary decrease in GMSL of several millimetres.
The rapid rise observed in 2023 is likely due in part to
El Niño. The long-term rate of sea-level rise has more
than doubled since the start of the satellite record,
increasing from 2.13 mm yr-1 between 1993 and 2002
to 4.77 mm yr-1 between 2014 and 2023.

the early stages of the 2023 El Niño (see Short-term climate drivers) led to an increase in sea
levels relative to the long-term mean in the most eastern part of the tropical Pacific between
April and June. Between July and September, the El Niño signature was clearly visible, with
above-average sea levels from the mid-tropical Pacific to the coasts of Central and South
America. Above-average sea levels were also observed in the tropical and North-East Atlantic,
associated with the anomalous warming in these areas during the northern hemisphere
summer. From October to the end of the year, the El Niño pattern continued to develop.
The shift to the positive phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) led to higher-than-average
sea levels in the western Indian Ocean and lower-than-average sea levels in the East (see
Short-term climate drivers).

MARINE HEATWAVES AND COLD SPELLS
As with heatwaves and cold spells on land, marine heatwaves and cold spells are prolonged
periods of extreme high or low temperatures in the seas and ocean that can have a range
of consequences for marine life and dependent communities. 27 Marine heatwaves have
become more frequent, intense and longer lasting since the late twentieth century, while
marine cold spells have been decreasing by those same measures. Satellite retrievals of
sea-surface temperature (SST) are used to monitor marine heatwaves and cold spells globally,
categorized in the present publication as “moderate”, “strong”, “severe”, “extreme” or “ice”
(for definitions, see Data set and methods).
El Niño events tend to cause widespread marine heatwaves in the eastern tropical Pacific.
While this region did experience strong marine heatwaves in 2023 until late October (see
Figure 8a), and moderate marine heatwaves for the rest of 2023, the overall areal coverage
was smaller than in previous El Niño events.

Of note in 2023 were the persistent and widespread marine heatwaves in the North Atlantic,
which began in the northern hemisphere spring, peaked in extent in September and persisted
through the end of the year. While areal coverage diminished in December, intensity increased.
The end of 2023 saw a broad band of severe and extreme marine heatwaves across the North
Atlantic, with temperature anomalies in the open ocean of +3 °C.
The Mediterranean Sea was also unusually warm relative to the baseline period and experienced
near-complete coverage of strong and severe marine heatwaves for the twelfth consecutive
year. In the southern hemisphere, the waters surrounding New Zealand remained 1 °C–2 °C
above the long-term average from January to September (~270 days).
At the end of 2023, most of the global ocean from roughly 20° N to 20° S of the equator had
been in a marine heatwave state since early November. In contrast, there were almost no
occurrences of marine cold spells within 60° N or 60° S of the equator in 2023 (see Figure 9a).
The global ocean experienced an average daily marine heatwave coverage of 32% (see
Figure 8b), well above the previous record of 23% in 2016. In contrast, the average daily
coverage of marine cold spells (see Figure 9b) was only 4%, far below 2022 (7%).

OCEAN ACIDIFICATION
The ocean absorbs about one quarter of the annual emissions of anthropogenic carbon dioxide
(CO2) released into the atmosphere. 28,29 CO2 reacts with seawater and alters the carbonate
chemistry, resulting in a decrease in pH referred to as “ocean acidification” (see Figure 10).
Ocean acidification affects organisms and ecosystem services, including food security, by
reducing biodiversity, degrading habitats and endangering fisheries and aquaculture.30 The
Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR6)
concluded that “[t]here is very high confidence that present-day surface pH values are
unprecedented for at least 26 000 years and current rates of pH change are unprecedented
since at least that time”. 31
Although global efforts, many supported by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission
(IOC) of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and
led by the Global Ocean Acidification Observing Network (GOA-ON) and the United Nations
Ocean Decade-endorsed Ocean Acidification Research for Sustainability (OARS) Programme,
have resulted in an increase in the number of ocean acidification observations, many regions
remain under sampled. Data collected for Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Indicator
14.3.1 (Average marine acidity (pH) measured at agreed suite of representative sampling
stations) show that current coverage is inadequate (see Figure 11), with time series not long
enough to determine trends and gaps in observations in all areas. Global trends illustrating
the decrease in global ocean surface pH (see Figure 10) show the large-scale effects of CO2
emissions. However, the rate of change in ocean acidification, and its pattern and scale,
show great regional and temporal variability, and understanding these variations requires
high-resolution, long-term observation at scales relevant to the affected communities.

CRYOSPHERE
The cryosphere comprises the frozen parts of Earth, namely glaciers and ice sheets, sea ice,
snow and permafrost. The inhospitable and often remote environments in which ice forms
mean that it has sometimes been challenging to undertake long-term measurements of the
cryosphere. At the same time, the profound changes seen in the cryosphere clearly illustrate
the global scale of climate change.

SEA-ICE
Arctic sea-ice extent remained well below normal in 2023, with the annual maximum and annual
minimum extents being respectively the fifth and sixth lowest in the 45-year satellite record.
Antarctic sea-ice extent reached an absolute record low for the satellite era (from 1979 to present) in
February. Sea-ice extent was at a record low for the time of year from June until early November, and
the annual maximum in September was about 1 million km2 below the previous record low maximum.

Arctic sea-ice extent reached its annual maximum of 14.62 million km2 on 6 March, the fifth
lowest in the satellite record. 32 The annual minimum Arctic sea-ice extent was reached on
19 September (see Figure 12, left), 33 with a minimum extent of 4.23 million km2, well below
the long-term average (1991–2020) of ~5.5 million km2. This was the sixth lowest minimum
Arctic sea-ice extent in the satellite record (1979–2023), not as extreme as 2012 or 2020 but
only slightly higher than 2007, 2016 and 2019, and continuing the long-term trend of reduced
late-summer and early-autumn Arctic ice cover. Major negative anomalies were observed
in the Beaufort, Chukchi and East Siberian Seas (see Figure 12, right). The year ended with
extents close to the long-term average, but still the ninth lowest in the satellite record. 34

Antarctic sea-ice extent had declined to 1.79 million km2 on 21 February 2023 (see Figure 13,
left), an all-time minimum for the satellite era (from 1979 to present) and slightly less than
the previous record low, which was set in 2022. 36 Sea-ice extent remained below the average
as the growth season commenced, reaching a record low for the time of year in May. Slow
growth continued with exceptional record low extents between July and the annual maximum,
likely in association with the warming of the Southern Ocean. 37 The maximum Antarctic
sea-ice extent for 2023 (see Figure 13, right) was 16.96 million km2 on 10 September, roughly
1.5 million km2 below the 1991–2020 average and 1 million km2 below the previous record low
maximum set in 1986. 38 Record low sea-ice extents for the time of year continued until early
November, but a slower-than-average rate of decline in December brought sea-ice extents
closer to the long-term mean by the end of the year. 39

ICE SHEETS
It was the warmest summer on record at Summit Station, 3.4 °C warmer than the 1991–2020 average
and 1.0 °C warmer than the previous record.

An ice sheet41 is an expanse of ice originating on land that covers an area of more than 50 000
km2. There are two principal ice sheets in the present-day climate system, one in Greenland
and one in Antarctica.42 The total mass balance of an ice sheet is the sum of three components:
surface mass balance, marine mass balance and basal mass balance. Surface mass balance is
the difference between snow accumulation and meltwater runoff from the ice sheet. Marine
mass balance is the mass loss at the edge of the ice sheet from the calving of icebergs and the
melting of ice that is in contact with the ocean. Basal mass balance consists of melting at the
ice sheet bed owing to geothermal heat and friction as the ice slides over the ground beneath.
A negative mass balance indicates loss of ice mass; a positive mass balance indicates gain.

Based on estimates from an ensemble of regional climate models, the Greenland ice sheet
continued to lose mass in the hydrological year 2022/2023 (from 1 September 2022 to 31 August
2023).43 Annual snow accumulation over Greenland still exceeds surface melt in most years,
giving a positive surface mass balance. For 2022–2023 this was estimated at +317 Gt, below
the long-term average but well above the extreme melt years of 2011–2012 and 2018–2019.
Combined with the basal mass balance (−27 Gt) and the marine mass balance (−504 Gt), the
estimated 2022–2023 ice sheet total mass balance was about −217 Gt.
The summer 2023 melt season was relatively intense, punctuated by major heatwaves in
July and August.44 Satellite melt extent data indicate that the ice sheet had the third highest
cumulative melt-day area45 on record (1978–2023), after the extreme melt season of 2012
and 2010 (see Figure 14). It was the warmest summer on record (1987–present) at Summit
Station, 46 3.4 °C warmer than the 1991–2020 average and 1.0 °C warmer than the previous
record.47 Summit Station experienced melting conditions for the fifth year on record (2012,
2019, 2021, 2022 and 2023); ice core records indicate that significant melting conditions last
happened in the late nineteenth century.48
The Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise has documented the acceleration
in combined mass loss from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets over the period of the
satellite record, 1992–2020.49 The average total mass balance of the Greenland and Antarctic
ice sheets over this period were −169 Gt yr-1 and −92 Gt yr-1, 50 respectively, and −261 Gt yr-1
combined. Combining the two ice sheets, the seven highest melt years on record have all
occurred since 2010, and average rates of mass loss increased from 105 Gt yr-1 between 1992
and 1996 to 372 Gt yr-1 between 2016 and 2020. This is equivalent to ~1 mm yr-1 of global
sea-level rise attributable to the polar ice sheets in the latter period.

Data and modelled estimates of mass balance from 2023 are consistent with these recent
rates of mass loss in Greenland, but the Antarctic ice sheet gained mass owing to higherthan-normal snow accumulation in the past year and a half (see Figure 15). Gravitational mass
balance data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission
for the hydrological year 2022/2023 give an estimated mass change of −196 Gt for Greenland,
close to the long-term rate of mass loss from the ice sheet. The Antarctic ice sheet gained
122 Gt over this same period.

GLACIERS
Preliminary data indicate the annual mass balance of a global set of reference glaciers for the
hydrological year 2022/2023 was –1.2 m of water equivalent. This is nominally the largest loss of ice
on record (1950–2023), driven by extremely negative mass balance in both western North America
and Europe.
Glaciers in western North America and the European Alps experienced an extreme melt season. In
Switzerland, glaciers have lost about 10% of their remaining volume in the past two years.

Glaciers are formed from snow that has compacted to form ice, which then deforms and flows
downhill. Glaciers comprise two zones: an accumulation zone, where accumulation of mass
from snowfall exceeds ice loss, and an ablation zone, where ice loss (ablation) from melting
and other mechanisms exceeds accumulation. Where glaciers end in a lake or the ocean, ice
loss can occur through melting where the ice meets the water, and via calving, when chunks
of the glacier break off.
Glacier mass balance – the amount of mass gained or lost by the glacier – is commonly
expressed as the annual thickness change averaged over the glacier area, in turn expressed
in metres of water equivalent (m w.e.).51 Melt rates are strongly affected by glacier albedo,
the fraction of sunlight that is reflected by the glacier surface. Exposed glacier ice is darker
and therefore has a lower albedo than the seasonal snowpack; it is also sensitive to darkening
from mineral dust, black carbon, algal activity and fallout from forest fires. Reduced snow
cover, long melt seasons and wildfire activity all serve to concentrate darker material on the
glacier surface, decreasing its albedo and thereby increasing melt.

Cryosphere

Preliminary data from a set of reference glaciers monitored by the World Glacier Monitoring
Service (WGMS) indicate a global annual mass balance for the hydrological year 2022/2023
of –1.2 m w.e., which is slightly more negative than 2021/2022 for the set of about 60 WGMS
reference glaciers. Based on the available glacier data, this is nominally a record low mass
balance (1950–2023, see Figure 16). Record loss was driven by extremely negative mass balance
in both western North America and Europe, and 7 out of the 10 most negative mass-balance
years have occurred since 2010.
The annual mass loss for Swiss glaciers in 2022–2023 was the second largest on record (from
1950 to present, see Figure 17) at 4.4% of the remaining ice volume. Together with the record
mass loss in 2021–2022 of 5.9%, Swiss glaciers have lost about 10% of their remaining volume
in just two years. This has been driven by low snowpacks and warm summers each year,
with potential cumulative impacts from glacier darkening associated with longer-than-normal
periods of exposed glacier ice and loss of high-elevation firn.53

Western North America experienced record (from 1965 to present) glacier mass loss in 2023,
with glacier-averaged annual thinning of more than 3.5 m at LiDAR-monitored54 glacier sites
in the Canadian Rockies and southern Coast Mountains. Based on regional LiDAR surveys,
North American glaciers lost mass at rates that were five times higher than rates measured
for the period 2000–2019.55 Adjusting the LiDAR altimetry data for snow and ice density,
estimates of mass balance at two sites with long-term measurements, Place (see Figure 18)
and Haig Glaciers, are, respectively, 3.1 ± 0.5 m w.e. and –3.8 ± 0.6 m w.e. In situ mass balance
measurements from these two sites give estimates of –3.7 m w.e. and –4.1 m w.e., respectively;
far below the long-term mean and more than 1 m w.e. below the previous record minima.
The large negative mass balances are due to a below-average winter snowpack followed by
an intense spring heatwave that led to early exposure of bare ice across most glaciers and
icefields in south-west Canada. Seasonal snow was mostly gone in midsummer on most
glaciers, exposing darker firn or ice over an extended melt season (see Figure 17). Aboveaverage summer temperatures and record wildfire activity in western Canada56 (see Extreme
weather and climate events) contributed to the extreme melt, with particulate deposition

Cryosphere

from the wildfires further darkening the glacier surfaces. High rates of cumulative melting
over the past several years may also be a factor, as impurities are increasingly concentrated
on the glacier surfaces and the firn zone has been lost on many mountain glaciers. These
factors are becoming persistent, and glaciers in western North America lost an estimated
9% of their 2020 volume over the period 2020–2023.

SNOW COVER
Seasonal snow cover in the northern hemisphere has been experiencing a long-term decline in the
late spring and summer. Northern hemisphere snow-cover extent for May was the eighth lowest
on record (1967–2023). North American snow-cover extent for May 2023 was the lowest on record
(1967–2023).

Seasonal snow cover in the northern hemisphere has been experiencing a long-term decline
in the late spring and summer, which continued in 2023. Northern hemisphere snow-cover
extent from January through April 2023 was close to the long-term average (1991–2020),
but the spring heatwave in North-western North America drove widespread snowmelt.
North American snow-cover extent for May 2023 was the lowest on record (1967–2023) at
7.47 million km2, about 1.57 million km2 (17%) below the long-term average, while overall
northern hemisphere snow-cover extent was 16.74 million km2, the eighth lowest since 1967
and 1.47 million km2 below the long-term average (see Figure 19).

Climate Monitoring and Renewable Energy
Hamid Bastani and Roberta Boscolo
Renewable energy generation, primarily driven by the dynamic forces of solar radiation, wind and the water
cycle, has surged to the forefront of climate action for its potential to achieve decarbonization targets.
Worldwide, a substantial energy transition is already under way. In 2023, renewable capacity additions
increased by almost 50% compared with 2022, for a total of 510 GW.58 Such growth marks the highest rate
observed in the past two decades and, as the International Energy Agency (IEA) indicates, demonstrates the
potential to achieve the clean energy goal set at the twenty-eighth United Nations Climate Change Conference
(COP 28) to triple renewable energy capacity globally to reach 11 000 GW by 2030.59
In the era of this massive and fast transition to renewables, understanding the critical nexus between climate
variability and renewable energy is pivotal. A comprehensive knowledge of how the climate is going to
modulate the availability of and demand for renewable energy is essential for optimizing the operation and
planning of, and investments in, energy resources. The recent joint publication of WMO and the International
Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), 2022 Year in Review: Climate driven Global Renewable Energy Potential
Resources and Energy Demand, underscores the inherent links between renewable energy resources and
weather and climate conditions. The publication emphasizes the potential for developing countries – especially
in Africa, where energy access remains a key priority – to develop clean energy systems and urges better
accounting for climate variability for the improved operation, management and planning of energy resources.
The importance of accounting for climate variability can be seen in Figure 21, which shows monthly energy
supply and demand anomalies in Botswana, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe in 2022
relative to the average of the 1991–2020 reference period. The anomalies are measured by four defined energy
indicators, which are capacity factors60 for wind power, solar photovoltaic power, weighted total precipitation
as a proxy indicator for hydropower and energy degree days as a proxy indicator for energy demand.

To illustrate how the plots can be interpreted,
consider October, when demand in all five
countries is between 5% and 30% higher than
average, while a large portion of potential
generation is lower than average (except
for small increases in solar photovoltaic
power in Mozambique and Zimbabwe, and
wind power in Zimbabwe). In this situation,
balancing power would require careful
planning, for instance to ensure there were
enough water in hydropower dams from
the previous rainy season (typically ending
in May) ahead of the next rainy season
(typically starting in October–November).

Stratospheric ozone and ozone-depleting gases

19

STRATOSPHERIC OZONE AND OZONE-DEPLETING GASES
Following the success of the Montreal Protocol, the use of halons and chlorofluorocarbons
(CFCs) has been reported as discontinued, but their levels in the atmosphere continue to
be monitored.62 Owing to the long lifetimes of CFCs, these compounds will remain in the
atmosphere for many decades and, even if there were no new emissions, there would still
be more than enough chlorine and bromine present to cause the complete destruction of
the ozone in Antarctica from August to December. As a result, the formation of the Antarctic
ozone hole continues to be an annual spring event, with year-to-year variation in its size and
depth governed to a large degree by meteorological conditions. The “hole” is not, strictly
speaking, a hole; it is an area where the total column ozone in the stratosphere falls below
220 Dobson units.63
In 2023, the development of the ozone hole had an unusually early start, becoming the sixth
largest in the satellite era. It expanded to 26 million km2 on 21 September (see Figure 20),
comparable with the two previous years (2021 and 2022) and close to the maxima observed
in earlier years, such as 28.2 million km2 in 2015 and 29.6 million km2 in 2006, according to
analyses from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)64 and the Copernicus
Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS)65. NASA reported a minimum ozone of 99 Dobson
units on 3 October 2023. Despite the area of the ozone hole decreasing in a typical manner
through early October, it increased again towards the end of the month and remained at or
above approximately 15 million km2 until the first week of December. Although the ozone
hole was unusually long-lived in 2023, its longevity was similar to that of the ozone holes of
the past three years.
The unusual persistence of the ozone holes of the past three years was due to below-average
stratospheric temperatures and a strong polar vortex lasting until December. Several potential
drivers for the observed stronger polar vortex have been identified, including water vapour
injected into the stratosphere by the eruption of Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha’apai, wind patterns
in the southern hemisphere and climate change.

Short-term climate drivers

20

SHORT-TERM CLIMATE DRIVERS
A prolonged period of La Niña from mid-2020 to early 2023 gave way to El Niño conditions, which were
well established by September 2023, contributing to the observed rise in global mean sea-surface
temperatures during 2023.

There are many different natural phenomena, often referred to as climate patterns or climate
modes, that affect weather and climate at timescales ranging from days to several months or
even years. In 2023, the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)
and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), highlighted here, contributed to major weather and
climate events across large areas of the world.

ENSO – EL NIÑO SOUTHERN OSCILLATION
ENSO is one of the most important climate drivers of year-to-year variability in weather patterns
worldwide. It is linked to hazards such as heavy rains, floods, droughts, heatwaves and cold
spells. El Niño, characterized by higher-than-average sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) in the
eastern tropical Pacific and a weakening of the trade winds, typically has a warming influence
on global temperatures. La Niña, which is characterized by below-average SSTs in the central
and eastern tropical Pacific and a strengthening of the trade winds, has the opposite effect.
A multi-year La Niña event began in mid-2020 and ended in early 2023. Subsequently, SSTs in
the eastern tropical Pacific increased, crossing typical El Niño thresholds (0.5 °C in Figure 22
(see below)) by June. However, the atmosphere was slower to respond, and it was not until
early September that El Niño conditions were well established in both the atmosphere and
ocean. By the end of the year, a strong El Niño had developed, with the Oceanic Niño Index
reaching 2.0 °C for the November–January period, the highest value since the 2015/2016 El Niño.
El Niño has an influence on regional rainfall patterns. Precipitation anomalies were typical of
El Niño in some regions, including drier-than-usual conditions in maritime South-East Asia
and from southern Mexico to northern South America, and wetter-than-normal conditions
in parts of Chile (see Figure 23 below).
Decreased monsoon rainfall in South-East Asia is associated with El Niño. The onset of the
monsoon over Kerala, India, occurred on 8 June, seven days later than normal. By the end of
September, India had received 94% of its typical monsoon rainfall.66 Higher-than-normal rainfall
totals, however, were observed along the lower course of the Indus River and in central India.

Short-term climate drivers

In Australia, La Niña is associated with wetter-than-normal conditions, and El Niño with
drier-than-normal conditions. In January, rainfall for the country was 35% above normal
as La Niña drew gradually towards an end, but in August it was 50% below normal with a
strengthening El Niño. The dryness was also accompanied by the highest July-to-September
national mean temperatures in the country’s 114-year record. September was the driest on
record in Australia, and August–October was the driest three-month period in the 124-year
observational record. However, somewhat atypically for an El Niño event, November and
December were wetter than average in much of eastern Australia.
As average global temperature anomalies increased during the transition from La Niña to El
Niño, many regions also experienced heatwaves, including parts of China, Europe, Mexico,
North Africa and the Middle East, Siberia, South America and the United States of America. A
United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Frontiers report67 hhighlighted that variability
associated with El Niño has implications for biomass and fire weather,68 which increases the
risk of large and intense wildfires in some places. Please refer to Extreme weather and climate
events for more details on extreme events.

INDIAN OCEAN DIPOLE
The positive phase of the IOD is characterized by below-average SSTs (and sea level) in the
eastern Indian Ocean and above-average SSTs (and sea level) in the west. The negative phase
has the opposite pattern. The resulting change in the gradient of SST across the ocean basin
affects the weather of the surrounding continents, primarily in equatorial regions and the
southern hemisphere. Positive IOD events are often, but not always, associated with El Niño,
and negative events with La Niña.
In conjunction with the emergence of El Niño, the first positive IOD since 2019 developed in
early austral spring and peaked during October 2023. The positive IOD helped to intensify the
anomalously dry and warm conditions over parts of Australia during this time. Conversely,
rainfall totals in the Horn of Africa during the October–December rainy season were much
higher than normal, leading to flooding in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia; this follows the
prolonged drought in the region from 2020 to early 2023, when La Niña conditions and a
neutral to negative IOD were largely present.

NORTH ATLANTIC OSCILLATION
Average sea-level pressure in the North Atlantic is characterized by an area of lower pressure
close to Iceland, known as the Icelandic low, and an area of higher pressure centred over the
Azores, known as the Azores high. The NAO is based on the sea-level pressure difference
between the Icelandic low and the Azores high. It is mainly associated with driving weather
conditions in the North Atlantic basin, Europe and the Mediterranean. The positive phase
is characterized by below-normal pressure over the North Atlantic and high latitudes, and
above-normal pressure over the central Atlantic, the eastern United States and western
Europe. The negative phase has the opposite pattern. As the phases are determined by
pressure changes in the atmosphere, they can fluctuate more rapidly, from days to weeks,
compared with other climate drivers such as ENSO, which are driven by slower changes in
ocean temperature and fluctuate from months to years.
High pressure associated with the negative NAO in late June and July 2023 contributed to a
heatwave that caused significant snowmelt and ice melt across southern Greenland. Several
widespread melting events occurred during this period. Ireland reported its warmest June
on record (124 years), as did the long-running Uccle station in Belgium (191 years). In eastern
Canada, many locations reported record warmth for July.

PRECIPITATION
Accumulated precipitation totals in 2023 were above the long-term average (see Figure 23) in
East and Central Asia and parts of northern Asia; the western Indian summer monsoon region;
parts of the Maritime Continent; northern New Zealand; parts of West, Central, southern and
East Africa; western, Central and South-East Europe; southern Scandinavia; the western Middle
East; North-West, South-West and South-East North America; the Greater Antilles; and parts of
South-East South America.
Regions with a marked rainfall deficit included South-East South America, the Amazon basin
and much of Central America; southern Canada; the western Mediterranean region and
South-West Europe; parts of North-West, Central and southern Africa; parts of Central Asia;
the eastern Indian monsoon region; parts of South-East Asia and the Maritime Continent;
south-west and coastal north Australia; and many of the Pacific Islands.
The onset of the West African monsoon was around normal. The Greater Horn of Africa
region, which had been experiencing long-term drought, suffered substantial flooding in
2023, particularly later in the year as heavy rains associated with El Niño and the positive
IOD became established (see Extreme weather and climate events).

Extreme weather and
climate events
Extreme weather continues to lead to severe socioeconomic impacts.
Extreme heat affected many parts of the world.
Wildfires in Canada, Europe and Hawaii (United States of America) led to loss of life, the destruction
of homes and large-scale air pollution.
Flooding associated with extreme rainfall from Mediterranean Cyclone Daniel affected Greece,
Bulgaria, Türkiye and Libya, with particularly heavy loss of life in Libyaa.

Extreme weather and climate events had major impacts on all inhabited continents in 2023.
These included major floods (some of them associated with tropical cyclones), extreme
heat and droughts, and associated wildfires, which presented challenges to water and food
security as well as to human welfare.69,70 Some of the most significant events are described
below, with a broader range of events described in the online supplement.
One of the most significant single weather-related events in terms of loss of life was the
Mediterranean cyclone (or “medicane”), referred to locally as Storm Daniel, in September.
In its initial stages, the storm produced extreme rainfall in southern Bulgaria, Greece and
parts of Türkiye, while at the same time another storm system produced significant flash
flooding in Spain, with adverse effects on cereal production.71 The heaviest falls were in the
Thessaly region of Greece, to the north of Athens, where Zagora, Pelion, received 760 mm
on 5 September and a five-day total of 1 096 mm from 4 to 8 September, while in Bulgaria
329 mm fell in 16 hours at Kosti on 4–5 September. The storm then remained slow-moving in
the eastern Mediterranean for several days before its major rainbands impacted north-eastern
Libya on 10 and 11 September. Extreme rainfalls affected the coast and nearby mountains,
with 414 mm falling in 24 hours at Al-Bayda on 10–11 September. The intense rainfalls resulted
in extreme flooding in the region. The most extreme impacts were in the city of Derna (about
50 km east of Al-Bayda), where much of the central city was destroyed by flooding that was
exacerbated by the failure of two dams. At least 4 700 confirmed deaths in Libya have been
attributed to the flooding,72 with 8 000 people still missing (as at 15 December). There were
19 additional deaths in Bulgaria and Greece.73
Tropical Cyclone Freddy in February and March was one of the world’s longest-lived tropical
cyclones. It formed on 6 February off the western coast of Australia and, after earlier landfalls
in Madagascar and Mozambique, made its final landfall in Mozambique on 11 March before
moving inland as a remnant low. The major impacts of Freddy came because of flooding during
the final landfall, both in Malawi and Mozambique, as extremely heavy rain fell (up to 672 mm
during the storm in Mozambique). Parts of Malawi and Mozambique had not yet recovered
from storms in 2022. Malawi was especially hard hit, with at least 679 deaths reported and
over 659 000 internal displacements,74 and there were a further 165 deaths in Mozambique.75
Casualties were also reported in Madagascar and Zimbabwe, and at sea near Mauritius.
Tropical Cyclone Mocha, in May, was one of the most intense cyclones ever observed in the
Bay of Bengal, reaching peak 10-minute sustained winds of 115 kt. It formed on 11 May and
made landfall near the Bangladesh–Myanmar border on 14 May. Cyclone Mocha triggered
1.7 million displacements across the subregion, from Sri Lanka to Myanmar and through
India and Bangladesh.76 In Bangladesh, displacement was reported in Cox’s Bazar, the
world’s largest refugee settlement, which is home to over 900 000 Rohingya refugees from
Myanmar.77 More than 29 000 people were temporarily relocated.78 In total, at least 156 lives
were lost in Myanmar,79 and over 270 000 buildings were damaged or destroyed.80 At least
63 000 displacements took place in camps sheltering people already displaced by conflict
and violence.81 The effects of Cyclone Mocha, together with an intensification of conflict and
record-high food prices, severely aggravated acute food insecurity, especially among the
3.4 million vulnerable people assessed as in need of humanitarian assistance.82

Extreme weather and climate events

The largest reported economic loss from a single event in 2023 was from Hurricane Otis,
which hit the Pacific coast of Mexico in late October. Otis reached hurricane intensity at 1200
Universal Time Coordinated (UTC) on 24 October, and within 15 hours had intensified to a
category 5 system, 83 one of the most rapid rates of intensification observed in the satellite
era. Shortly afterwards, it made landfall just west of Acapulco at near peak intensity, with
maximum sustained winds of 260 km hr-1, which might be the first known category 5 landfall
on the Pacific coast of Mexico. The hurricane caused widespread destruction in Acapulco and
surrounding areas, with economic losses estimated at 12 billion US dollars (USD). 84 At least
48 deaths were attributed to the hurricane, 85 with a further 32 people missing, mostly at sea.
The North Island of New Zealand suffered repeated extreme rainfall and flooding events in
January and February. The most significant was on 13–14 February, when Cyclone Gabrielle
passed just east of North Island as a post-tropical system. Daily rainfalls exceeded 500 mm
in parts of eastern North Island, and Auckland had its lowest air pressure (971.5 hPa) on
record. Eleven deaths were reported because of Gabrielle, and four by more localized floods
in Auckland on 27–28 January. Total economic losses from the two events were estimated
at USD 5.3–USD 8.6 billion,86 by far the costliest non-earthquake disaster recorded in New
Zealand.
Many significant heatwaves occurred in various parts of the world during 2023. Some of the
most significant were in southern Europe and North Africa, especially in the second half of
July, when severe and exceptionally persistent heat occurred. Italy was particularly affected,
with temperatures reaching 48.2 °C on 24 July at Lotzorai and Jerzu, Sardinia; only 0.6 °C
below the European record set in Sicily in 2021.87 On 23 August, a mean daily temperature
of 32.98 °C was reported at the Brera Observatory in Milan, the highest in a record dating
back to 1763. Among the other locations experiencing record-high temperatures were Tunis
(49.0 °C on 24 July), Tirana (43.0 °C on 25 July), Agadir (Morocco) (50.4 °C on 11 August)
and Algiers (49.2 °C on 23 July). The extreme heat shifted to South-East Europe in late July,
and further heatwaves affected West-Central Europe in late August and early September.
Numerous locations in southern France, northern Spain and western Switzerland set records
during these events, including Toulouse (France) (42.4 °C on 23 August 88). There was also
extensive wildfire activity during the summer, particularly in Greece (both on the mainland
and islands). A fire in north-eastern Greece in late August and early September that burned
96 000 ha was the largest fire ever observed in the European Union.89
The 2023 wildfire season in Canada was well beyond any previously recorded. Significant
fire activity began in late April, expanded during a very warm, dry May, and continued
throughout the summer and into early autumn. The total area burned nationally for the year
was 14.9 million ha, more than seven times the long-term average (1986–2022) and far above
the previous record seasonal total of 6.7 million ha in 1989 (see Figure 24). Altogether 297
evacuation orders were issued for over 235 000 people.90 The fires also resulted in significant
and widespread smoke pollution, particularly in the heavily populated areas of eastern Canada
and the north-eastern United States of America in the first half of June. Four deaths were
directly attributed to fires, although the broader health impacts of the smoke are yet to be
fully assessed.
The deadliest single wildfire of the year occurred in Hawaii (United States), on the western
side of the island of Maui. Extreme fire weather conditions, with low humidity and strong,
gusty winds driven by a pressure gradient between strong high pressure to the North and the
circulation of Hurricane Dora well to the South, combined with pre-existing drought to favour
the development and rapid spread of intense fires. The most affected region was around the
town of Lahaina, which was largely destroyed with over 2 200 structures lost. Mandatory

evacuation notices were issued for 7 500 people across the area. 91 At least 100 deaths were
reported, 92 the most in a wildfire in the United States for more than 100 years, with 400 homes
destroyed93 and estimated economic losses of USD 5.6 billion. Wildfires of such intensity and
speed of movement are extremely rare in the tropics.

Long-term drought persisted in North-western Africa and parts of the Iberian Peninsula,
as well as in parts of Central and South-West Asia, and intensified in many parts of Central
America, northern South America and the southern United States. Among the most
significant areas of drought was an area of subtropical South America, focused on northern
Argentina and Uruguay. Rainfall from January to August was 20%–50% below average
over much of northern and central Argentina, with some regions experiencing their fourth
successive year of significantly below-average rainfall. In Uruguay, water storages reached
critically low levels, badly affecting the quality of supplies to major centres, including
Montevideo, although there was some improvement in the situation from August.
Although there was some easing of drought conditions in subtropical South America later
in the year, they intensified in many parts of the continent’s interior, including in large parts
of the Amazon basin. Eight Brazilian states recorded their lowest July–September rainfall in
over 40 years. The Rio Negro at Manaus reached a record low level (observations started in
1902) on 26 October, 0.93 m below the previous record set in 2010.95
The Greater Horn of Africa region, which had been experiencing long-term drought, suffered
substantial flooding in 2023, particularly later in the year following heavy rains associated
with El Niño and the positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) (see Short-term climate drivers).
The most badly affected area was the region encompassing south-eastern Ethiopia, northeastern Kenya and the southern half of Somalia. During the Deyr rainy season (October and
November), monthly rainfall in this region was widely 100–200 mm and locally exceeded
200 mm, several times the long-term averages. There were at least 352 deaths reported across
the three countries.96 Throughout Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Uganda
and the United Republic of Tanzania, widespread and severe flooding displaced 1.8 million
people, 97 in addition to the 3 million people already displaced internally or across borders
by five consecutive seasons of drought 98 in Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia. The wet
conditions did lead to some recovery in pasture and crop conditions after the extended
drought. Landslides and flooding in early December also resulted in at least 89 deaths in
northern parts of the United Republic of Tanzania.99 Pastoralist communities continued to be
affected by asset losses after two consecutive years of drought, which continued to adversely
affect agricultural production and reduced cereal production in 2023 compared with 2022.100

Socio-economic impacts
Food security, population displacements and impacts on vulnerable populations continued to be
of mounting concern in 2023, with weather and climate hazards exacerbating the situation in many
parts of the world.
Extreme weather and climate conditions continued to trigger new, prolonged and secondary
displacement in 2023 and increased the vulnerability of many who had already been uprooted by
complex multi-causal situations of conflict and violence.
The development and implementation of local disaster risk reduction strategies has increased since
the adoption of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.
One of the essential components for reducing the impact of disasters is to have effective multi-hazard
early warning systems.

The events described above, and many others besides, occur in a broader context. Extreme
weather and climate events interact with, and in some cases trigger or exacerbate, situations
concerning water and food security, population mobility and environmental degradation.101,102

FOOD SECURITY
The number of people who are acutely food insecure worldwide has more than doubled,
from 149 million people before the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic to 333 million
people in 2023 (in 78 countries monitored by the World Food Programme (WFP)).103 Although
global hunger levels remained unchanged from 2021 to 2022, they are still far above preCOVID 19 pandemic levels: in 2022, 9.2% of the global population (735.1 million people) were
undernourished, compared with 7.9% (612.8 million people) in 2019 (see Figure 25).104 The
current global food and nutrition crisis is the largest in modern human history.105 Protracted
conflicts, economic downturns and high food prices are at the root of high global food insecurity
levels. High food prices are exacerbated by the high costs of agricultural inputs, driven by
ongoing and widespread conflict around the world, and high global food insecurity levels are
aggravated by the effects of climate and weather extremes. In southern Africa, for example,
weather extremes, including the passage of Cyclone Freddy in February 2023, have affected
areas of Madagascar, southern Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. Flooding associated
with the cyclone submerged extensive agricultural areas and inflicted severe damage on
crops, which has exacerbated a slow economic recovery.106

Food security

Globally, annual economic losses from climate- and weather-related disasters have increased
since the 2000s.108 Between 2007 and 2022, 88 post-disaster needs assessment surveys
conducted in 60 countries worldwide showed that over 65% of losses caused by droughts occur
in the agriculture sector, including crop and livestock production losses. For floods, storms and
cyclones, about 20% of losses are in agriculture.109
In early 2023, South Sudan continued to experience exceptional flooding, with water levels
remaining high even during the dry season. Despite relatively dry conditions locally, flooding
persisted owing to high flows from further upstream in the Nile basin and very slow drainage
from earlier floods. The prolonged flooding made it difficult for people to access basic needs such
as food, clean water and health care, and contributed to the near collapse of local livelihoods.
Between April and July 2023, 7.8 million people, almost two thirds of the total population of
South Sudan, were expected to experience severe acute food insecurity.110
Afghanistan experienced a substantial reduction in snowmelt and rainfall, resulting in another
poor crop season. This led to widespread acute food insecurity, particularly in the north and
north-eastern regions. Between May and October 2023, 15.3 million Afghans were estimated
to face severe acute food insecurity.111 In Yemen, 53% of the population were already classified
as in a crisis level of acute food insecurity or worse between October and December 2022.
High food and fuel prices, together with floods from March to September 2023, and protracted
conflict, further aggravated food insecurity.
In Indonesia, a meteorological drought linked to El Niño and the positive phase of the Indian
Ocean Dipole (IOD) (see Short-term climate drivers) occurred during the dry season, affecting 23
450 ha of paddy cultivation and causing 6 964 ha of crop failure as of August 2023. A decrease
of 645 000 t of rice production was predicted by October 2023,112 and crop planting in late 2023
was delayed.
In 2023, record maize production in Brazil compensated for below-average harvests due to
prolonged dry spells elsewhere in South America, especially in Argentina, where drought
conditions were expected to result in a 15% decrease in cereal production compared with the
five-year average. The return of El Niño in 2023 led to adverse consequences through the entire
crop cycle of maize in Central America and northern parts of South America, where water deficits
and high temperature curtailed both planting area and yields with compounding negative
impacts on final production, particularly for smallholders and more vulnerable households in
the Dry Corridor. During the second part of the season, tropical storms and unexpected heavy
rain events disrupted the normal growth of crops in certain areas near the Central America
Pacific coast. In Haiti, irregular seasonal rainfall, including periods of high-intensity precipitation,
contributed to decrease the production of primary crops In 2023, record maize production in
Brazil compensated for below-average harvests due to prolonged dry spells elsewhere in South
America, especially in Argentina, where drought conditions were expected to result in a 15%
decrease in cereal production compared with the five-year average. The return of El Niño in
2023 led to adverse consequences through the entire crop cycle of maize in Central America

of the season, tropical storms and unexpected heavy rain events disrupted the normal growth
of crops in certain areas near the Central America Pacific coast. In Haiti, irregular seasonal
rainfall, including periods of high-intensity precipitation, contributed to decrease the production
of primary crops.113
Oceania is expected to experience the sharpest annual reduction rate in cereal production
worldwide, with a 31.1% decline in 2023 compared with 2022, although this largely reflects a
reversion to near-average conditions after exceptionally high production in 2022, with 2023
only slightly below five-year averages.114
In September, Storm Daniel brought heavy rainfall to coastal and north-eastern Libya, flooding
nearly 3 000 ha of cropland, particularly in the Al Marj and Derna regions. These constitute the
main cropland areas in the eastern part of the country and are key sources of livelihoods. The
collapse of dams in Derna affected the irrigation system, and the floods affected many parts of
the agrifood value chain, damaging roads, cereal storage and overall market channels. According
to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) Global Information and
Early Warning System (GIEWS), Libya was already in a state of food crisis and in need of external
assistance in July 2023 before the floods.115

Displacement

DISPLACEMENT
Across the globe, millions of people, including internally displaced persons, refugees and
migrants, are on the move or have been forced to flee their homes and communities because
of disasters exacerbated by climate stresses and shocks. Weather hazards continued to trigger
new, prolonged and secondary displacement in 2023 and increased the vulnerability of many
who had already been uprooted by complex multi-causal situations of conflict and violence.
These trends are a clear indication of how vulnerability to climate shocks and stresses is
undermining resilience and creating new protection risks, which threatens the achievements
of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
An estimated 3.4 million refugees and internally displaced people in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan,
Lebanon and the Syrian Arab Republic were in need of critical assistance to cope with extreme
winter conditions in 2023.116 In the north-west of the Syrian Arab Republic, snowstorms and
floods triggered displacements between January and March, many of which were repeated
movements of people already displaced by the country’s long-running conflict. Similarly,
in Yemen, heavy rains hit the country in April. Some sites for internally displaced people in
Marib were damaged, leaving dozens of people dead and injured.117
Many migrants entering Somalia found themselves stranded in June and July 2023, mostly
in the city of Bossaso, the main coastal crossing location to Yemen, as they were waiting
for more favourable weather conditions to cross the Gulf of Aden. In Hargeisa, a group of
migrants in transit suffered from extreme heat, and some died from dehydration.118
In addition to new displacements caused by high-impact disasters in 2023, many people
are still enduring the prolonged effects of climate-related displacements that took place in
previous years. In Pakistan, the 2022 monsoon floods, which triggered the largest disaster
displacement event in a decade, continued to have long-standing impacts in 2023. Displaced
communities were still recovering when heavy rains hit some districts in June 2023, causing
waterborne and vector-borne diseases.119
Displacement in the context of climate change and environmental degradation is often multicausal. Most people move owing to a combination of social, political, economic, environmental
and demographic drivers, all of which are and will continue to be affected by climate and
environmental change. In Somalia alone, some 531 000 displacements were recorded related
to the ongoing drought in 2023, in addition to 653 000 displacements primarily caused by
conflict.120 Subsequent flooding during the October–December rainy season affected more
than 2.4 million individuals, displacing over 1 million people.121 Estimates for Storm Daniel
indicate close to 45 000 individuals displaced in north-eastern Libya.122 Additionally, a
substantial number of migrants were reported to be living in a low-lying area adjacent to
Wadi Derna, raising concerns that the floods may have destroyed many of their settlements
with significant loss of life.123
Climate-related shocks and stresses in migration and displacement contexts affect people’s
livelihoods, which entrenches poverty (SDG) 1124 and hunger (SDG 2);125 pose direct threats to
lives and well-being (SDG 3);126 widen inequality gaps (SDG 10);127 and limit access to quality
education (SDG 4),128 water and sanitation (SDG 6),129 as well as to clean energy (SDG 7).130
Women and girls are among the worst affected (SDG 5)131 owing to pre-existing gender and
socioeconomic inequalities compounding their vulnerabilities.132

28

Displacement

To better prepare for these contexts, governments, communities, civil society and the United
Nations are engaged at all levels to strengthen climate resilience and effective disaster risk
reduction. A main priority is the community level, where preparedness efforts, including early
warning systems and emergency preparedness, are accelerating.133 A total of 126 countries are
in possession of disaster risk management strategies, with 99 countries reporting to have local
governments with disaster risk reduction strategies. The development and implementation
of local disaster risk reduction strategies has increased since the adoption of the Sendai
Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction in 2015.134
One of the essential components for reducing the impact of disasters is to have effective
multi-hazard early warning systems (MHEWSs), and systems in place for generating disaster
risk information and creating and disseminating early warnings, as well as having plans to
act on the warnings. As at 2023, 102 countries reported having MHEWSs in place – more
than half the countries in the world. The Early Warnings for All initiative was launched by the
Secretary-General of the United Nations in March 2022 with the aim of ensuring that everyone
on Earth is protected from hazardous weather, water or climate events through life-saving
early warning systems by the end of 2027.

The State of Climate Finance
Climate Policy Initiative
In 2021–2022,1 global climate flows reached almost 1.3 trillion US dollars (USD), nearly
doubling compared with 2019–2020 levels (see Figure 26). TThis increase was primarily
driven by a significant acceleration in mitigation finance, up by USD 439 billion compared with
2019–2020. The remainder of the observed growth in 2021–2022 stemmed from methodological
improvements to, and additional data sources used in, the Global Landscape of Climate
Finance. Despite this growing momentum in climate finance, tracked flows represented only
approximately 1% of global gross domestic product (GDP).
Comparing tracked climate finance flows with estimated climate finance needs exposes
a large financing gap. In an average scenario, 2 for a 1.5 °C pathway, annual climate finance
investments need to grow by more than six times, reaching almost USD 9 trillion by 2030
and a further USD 10 trillion through 2050.
Despite the large financing gap, the cost of inaction is even higher. 3 Aggregating over the
period 2025–2100, the total cost of inaction is estimated at USD 1 266 trillion; that is, the
difference in losses under a business-as-usual scenario 4 and those incurred within a 1.5 °C
pathway. This figure is, however, likely to be a dramatic underestimate of the true cost of
inaction, since it does not capture losses to nature and biodiversity, and those induced by
conflict and migration, among others. Indeed, the cost of inaction only promises to rise with
insufficient mitigation and inadequate adaptation.
Disaggregating global climate finance flows reveals that growth is neither sufficient nor
consistent across sectors and regions. The growth in global climate finance in 2021–2022
largely stemmed from significant increases in clean energy investments in only a handful of
geographies; China, Brazil, Europe, India, Japan and the United States of America together
received 90% of the increase in funds. Other regions, including many climate-vulnerable
countries, and other important sectors – for example, agriculture and industry – are being left
behind, receiving disproportionately little finance given their significant mitigation potential.
In addition, emerging mitigation technologies, including battery storage and hydrogen, are
only beginning to attract private finance and are yet to be scaled up.

Climate finance needs are estimated as a range, including lower-bound, upper-bound and average needs, based on direct
investments in climate-specific physical assets and excluding transition-related unabated fossil fuel finance..

A business-as-usual scenario is understood here as equivalent to a 3 °C pathway.

31

Of particular concern, adaptation finance continues to lag. Though adaptation finance
reached an all-time high of USD 63 billion in 2021–2022, the global adaptation financing gap
is widening, falling well short of the estimated USD 212 billion per year needed up to 2030 in
developing countries alone. Tracked adaptation finance remains dominated by public actors
(98%), while tracking challenges continue to impede a clear picture of adaptation action by
the private sector. The majority of adaptation finance is directed to the water and wastewater
sector, reflecting efforts to build resilience to water stress, while other sectors with wideranging adaptation potential – for example, agriculture – continue to receive only minimal
finance. Mainstreaming adaptation and resilience into development pathways is imperative,
particularly in highly vulnerable developing countries.
Moving forward, all actors must urgently work to scale the quantity and quality of climate
finance. Key priorities for ensuring more and better climate finance include transforming the
financial system with an emphasis on concessional financing and de-risking; bridging climate
and development needs; harnessing synergies to deliver co-benefits for both people and
nature; mobilizing domestic capital, with an emphasis on enabling policies and regulatory
frameworks; and improving the availability and accessibility of quality, granular data to
measure and manage progress.

GLOBAL TEMPERATURES DATA
GLOBAL MEAN TEMPERATURE SERIES
The method for calculating global mean temperature anomalies relative to an 1850–1900
baseline is based on the assessment of long-term change and its uncertainty made by
Working Group I in its contribution to the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR6 WG I). In 2021, the IPCC AR6 WG I assessed change from
1850–1900 to other periods based on an average of four datasets – HadCRUT5, Berkeley Earth,
NOAA Interim, and Kadow et al., 2020 – which start in 1850 and are globally or near-globally
complete in the modern period.
To include shorter datasets, which can help to better understand recent temperature changes,
in the present publication, the estimate made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) for the temperature change between 1850–1900 and 1981–2010 is combined
with estimated changes between 1981–2010 and the current year from six datasets to calculate
anomalies for 2023 relative to 1850–1900. There is good agreement among the datasets on
changes from 1981–2010 to the present, as this is a period with good observational coverage.
The additional uncertainty from the spread of the datasets is combined with that of the
estimate of the IPCC of the uncertainty in the change from 1850–1900 to 1981–2010. Global
mean temperature anomalies were calculated relative to an 1850–1900 baseline using the
following steps, starting from the time series of global monthly mean temperatures for each
dataset:
1. For each dataset, anomalies were calculated relative to the 1981–2010 average by subtracting
the mean for the period 1981–2010 for each month separately.
2. An annual mean anomaly was calculated from the monthly mean anomalies.
3. The amount of 0.69 °C was added to each series, based on the estimated difference
between 1850–1900 and 1981–2010, calculated using the method from IPCC AR6 WG I
(see the caption for Figure 1.12 in the corresponding publication).
4. The mean and standard deviation of the estimates were calculated.
5. The uncertainty in the IPCC estimate was combined with the standard deviation, assuming
the two are independent and assuming the IPCC uncertainty range (0.54 °C–0.79 °C) is
representative of a 90% confidence range (1.645 standard deviations).

Data sets and methods

33

The number quoted in the present publication for 2023 (1.45 ± 0.12 °C) was calculated in this
way, with 1.45 °C being the mean of the seven estimates, and 0.03 °C the standard deviation.

ANNUAL TEMPERATURE MAPS
For the map of temperature anomalies for 2023, a median of six datasets was used, re-gridded
to the spatial grid of the lowest resolution datasets (NOAAGlobalTemp and HadCRUT5), which
are presented on a 5° latitude by 5° longitude grid. The median is used in preference to the
mean to minimize the effect of potential outliers in individual grid cells. The half-range of the
datasets provides an indication of the uncertainty. The spread between the datasets is largest
at high latitudes and in Central Africa, both regions with sparse data coverage.

GLOBAL MEAN TEMPERATURE ANOMALIES FOR 2023 RELATIVE TO OTHER PERIODS
Table 1 (see below) shows global mean temperature anomalies for individual datasets for 2023
relative to four different baselines. The uncertainty indicated for the three modern baselines
(1981–2010, 1991–2020 and 1961–1990) is the standard deviation of the available estimates
multiplied by 1.645 to represent the 90% uncertainty range.

OCEAN HEAT CONTENT
The ensemble mean is an update of the outcome of a concerted international effort,135 and
all products used are referenced here. Note that global ocean heat content values are given
for the ocean surface area between 60° S and 60° N and limited to areas deeper than 300 m
in each product. The value for 2022 is based on a subset of the products for which updates
are available. A baseline of 2005–2021 is used for the ocean heat content time series (see
Figure 4), as near-global coverage is available for this period thanks to the network of Argo
subsurface floats.
The 2023 value is based on the estimate from Minière et al., 2023 and Cheng et al., 2017 (see

MARINE HEATWAVE AND MARINE COLD SPELL
Marine heatwaves are categorized as moderate when the sea-surface temperature (SST) is
above the ninetieth percentile of the climatological distribution for five days or longer. The
subsequent categories are defined in respect of the difference between the SST and the
climatological distribution average: “strong”, “severe” or “extreme”, if that difference is,
respectively, more than two, three or four times the difference between the ninetieth percentile
and the climatological distribution average.136
Marine cold spell categories are analogous but counting days below the tenth percentile, except
for the “ice” category. This category is given to any marine cold spell when the threshold
for the occurrence on any given day of the event is below –1.7 °C.137 These are therefore
considered to be conditions related to sea ice, and not extreme temperature fluctuations.
The baseline used for marine heatwaves and cold spells is 1982–2011, which is shifted by one
year from the standard normal period of 1981–2010 because the first full year of the satellite
SST series on which it is based is 1982. This period has not been updated to the current
standard normal period of 1991–2020 because the shifting of the baseline has a significant
effect on the results and would not allow for comparison of marine heatwaves/marine cold
spells statistics with previous versions of the present publication.
All marine heatwaves and cold spells are detected using the NOAA 1/4° Daily Optimum
Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (OISST) v2.1 dataset (Huang et al., 2021).

Data sets and methods

Gravimetric (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE)) ice mass time series for the
Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are calculated using spherical harmonics from JPL RL06v1,
following Velicogna et al., 2020. The degree-1 geocentre terms are calculated using Sutterley
and Velicogna, 2019 using C2,0 and C3,0 coefficients from Loomis et al., 2019. The GRACE/
GRACE Follow-on (GRACE-FO) data are corrected for the long-term trend of glacial isostatic
adjustment (GIA) from the solid earth using the regional IJ05-R2 GIA model (Ivins et al., 2013)
over Antarctica and the regional GIA model over Greenland (Simpson et al., 2009). These
regional GIA models do not include realistic GIA signal outside the ice sheets. For this reason,
outside Greenland and Antarctica, GIA corrections are based on Geruo et al., 2013 with the
ICE6G ice history (Peltier et al., 2015).

Data are from the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites
(EUMETSAT) Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility Sea Ice Index v2p2138 and the
National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) v3 Sea Ice Index.139 Sea-ice concentrations are
estimated from microwave radiances measured from satellites. Extent is the area of ocean
grid cells where the sea-ice concentration exceeds 15%. There are modest differences in the
absolute extent among datasets, but they agree well on year-to-year changes and trends.
In the main text of the present publication, NSIDC values are reported for absolute extents,
and rankings. Comparison figures for the Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility are

In Figure 22, Iceland is shown as being much drier than the long-term average and parts of
China as much wetter. This is owing to a change in the way that real-time data are processed
and is not reflective of actual conditions.
