TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2023

OPENING GREEN WINDOWS
Technological opportunities for a low-carbon world

NOTE
Within the UNCTAD Division on Technology and Logistics, the Technology and Innovation Policy Research
Section carries out policy-oriented analytical work on the impact of innovation and new and emerging
technologies on sustainable development, with a particular focus on the opportunities and challenges for
developing countries. It is responsible for the Technology and Innovation Report, which seeks to address
issues in science, technology and innovation that are topical and important for developing countries, and
to do so in a comprehensive way with an emphasis on policy-relevant analysis and conclusions. The
Technology and Innovation Policy Research Section supports the integration of STI in national development
strategies and in building up STI policy-making capacity in developing countries; a major instrument in this
area is the programme of Science, Technology and Innovation Policy Reviews.
In this report, the terms country/economy refer, as appropriate, to territories or areas. The designations
of country groups are intended solely for statistical or analytical convenience and do not necessarily
express a judgement about the stage of development reached by a particular country or area in the
development process. Unless otherwise indicated, the major country groupings used in this report follow
the classification of the United Nations Statistical Office. These are:
Developed countries: the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) (other than Chile, Mexico, the Republic of Korea and Turkey), plus the European
Union member countries that are not OECD members (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Lithuania, Malta and
Romania), plus Andorra, Liechtenstein, Monaco and San Marino. Countries with economies in transition
refers to those of South-East Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States. Developing
economies, in general, are all the economies that are not specified above. For statistical purposes, the
data for China do not include those for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China (Hong
Kong, China), Macao Special Administrative Region of China (Macao, China) or Taiwan Province of China.

OPENING GREEN WINDOWS
Technological opportunities for a low-carbon world

FOREWORD
The world finds itself trapped in the grip of cascading crises — from global poverty and inequality, to
hunger and conflicts — that require collective action to address.
In particular, climate change is a global challenge that calls for global solutions. The battle to keep the
1.5-degree limit alive will be won or lost this decade. We need to act together to close the emissions
gap, and transform our energy systems to secure the liveable future required by people and planet alike.
The theme of this year’s report – Opening green windows: Technological opportunities for a low-carbon
world – reminds us that innovation and frontier technologies can drive the transformative solutions we
need.
We need a revolution in renewable energy innovation and technology. Supported by adequate regulations,
incentives and investment, renewables provide a clear path to real energy security, affordable power
prices and sustainable employment opportunities.
Above all, we must support developing countries as they make the transition to renewable energy.
A renewables revolution means sharing knowledge and technologies with all countries, equally. Currently,
the majority of global renewable energy capacity, technology and expertise is housed within a handful
of countries. As the world transitions to a net-zero, resilient and just future, we cannot allow developing
countries to fall behind.
A renewables revolution also means ensuring that policies and processes are in place to reduce market
risk and attract investments to the renewable energy transition across developing countries. Together
with international financial institutions and the private sector, developed countries must level the playing
field to fast-track renewable energy projects in developing countries.
The fight against climate change is everybody’s fight.
By working in solidarity and creating the conditions for the renewables revolution, we can harness the
full potential of a just transition for all countries, and pass on a greener, prosperous and more sustainable
world to our children and grandchildren.

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2023

OPENING GREEN WINDOWS
Technological opportunities for a low-carbon world

PREFACE
Developing countries are facing a series of interconnected and cascading crises, including war in Ukraine,
the COVID-19 pandemic, the impacts of climate change, and disruptions in geopolitics. To address these
challenges, the Technology and Innovation Report (TIR) 2023 focuses on the opportunities presented by
the renewable energy revolution in the Global South. These opportunities not only offer the chance to
build resilience and mitigate climate disaster, but also to spur economic and technological development,
allowing developing countries to “leap” out of the cascade of crisis and move forward.
The report provides a comprehensive picture of green and frontier technologies today, including analyses
of their market size, potential for employment creation, and most promising sectors. We cover 17 frontier
technologies such as artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, green hydrogen, and electric vehicles. The
report estimates that these technologies already represented a $1.5 trillion market in 2020. Thanks to their
rapid growth, by 2030 their market value could reach over $9.5 trillion –about three times the current size
of the Indian economy.
The report presents a critical assessment of the potential catch-up trajectories in renewable energy
technologies in the Global South, sharing lessons from various developing countries in Latin America, Asia,
and Africa. The report also presents very original methodology that identifies which are the most complex
sectors (requiring more technological capacities) with the lowest carbon footprints. This methodology can
help various stakeholders in developing countries in designing a roadmap that selects the greenest paths
for economic diversification, while taking advantage of Industry 4.0 to get into specific global value chain
(GVC) niches. This TIR’s novel research directly addresses one of the four major transformation of the
Bridgetown Covenant - Transforming economies through diversification.
This report leaves us with three key messages:
First, developing countries must strategically position themselves to catch the green technological
revolution early. Access to technologies and knowhow is not enough – timing is especially crucial. Without
it, the green revolution will not close but widen global inequalities.
Second, international business-as-usual conditions mean that developing countries cannot on their
own take advantage of these green windows of opportunity. Immediate support from the international
community is needed to gather enough resources and build the required knowhow. It is also critical that
we improve the consistency of the trading system with the Paris Agreement, so that green technology can
be effectively transferred to developing nations.
Third, lastly: to address the current technological challenge we need two key things – agency and urgency.
The fight against climate change and inequalities is everybody’s fight – if we all share the same problem,
then we must also share the same tools to solve it. But time is running out. And if this window of opportunity
closes, it may well be the last one.

OPENING GREEN WINDOWS
Technological opportunities for a low-carbon world

OVERVIEW
1. GREEN WINDOWS OF OPPORTUNITY
In 2023, the world faces severe social and economic challenges. While trying to recover from the COVID-19
pandemic, many countries are now coping with the repercussions of the war in Ukraine, which has not
only caused immense suffering but has also heightened geopolitical tensions and created threats to global
trade and energy and food security.
The most difficult choices are in developing countries where this conjuncture of crises threatens hardwon development gains. To eliminate poverty, they need diversified and more productive economies to
create more and better jobs and boost household incomes. But faster economic growth will demand far
more energy which, if sourced from fossil fuels, would send millions of tons of carbon billowing into the
atmosphere.
Developing countries need not, however, follow the historical pathways of carbon-fuelled growth – if the
global community is committed to equitable social, economic and technological transformations guided
by the Sustainable Development Goals.
The 2023 edition of the Technology and Innovation Report focuses specifically on what can be achieved
by technological innovation, by opening ‘green windows of opportunity’. It does not suggest that these
problems will be solved by technology alone, nor that new technology is necessarily beneficial – since
the gains for one group can be detrimental for others. But it does argue that innovation and advances in
science and technology, if guided by the Sustainable Development Goals, can be used to drive the world
along more sustainable and equitable pathways, particularly in the generation and use of energy.
The report is built around the concept of green innovation – creating or introducing new or improved goods
and services that leave lighter carbon footprints and open up green windows of opportunity. Developing
countries now have opportunities to catch up, reduce poverty, and at the same time help tackle climate
change and set the world on a more sustainable course.
For countries aiming to catch up with the more technologically advanced countries, switching green
requires more than simple imitation; it demands creative adaptation and innovation. The pathways
are likely to differ substantially from those taken by advanced economies. The figure below sets out
the four main components of green innovation. The starting point is experimenting with new ideas
and technologies and adapting these to local circumstances, values and priorities (Figure 1). To take
advantage of these ideas, countries will need the appropriate infrastructure and in the form of public
goods – through direct government intervention, supporting the establishment of new green sectors, for
example, or introducing regulations such as on air or water pollution. Green innovation is also influenced
by global agreements and agendas, rules, and mechanisms, especially those related to climate change,
such as the Paris Agreement.

2. MOVING FAST WITH FRONTIER TECHNOLOGIES
At the leading edge of green innovation are new and rapidly developing technologies that take advantage
of digitalization and connectivity. The Report examines 17 of these ‘frontier technologies’ – from artificial
intelligence (AI) to green hydrogen to biofuels – highlighting their potential economic benefits and
assessing country capabilities to use, adopt, and adapt these innovations.
These technologies have experienced tremendous growth in the last two decades: in 2020 the total
market value was $1.5 trillion and by 2030 could reach $9.5 trillion. Around half of the latter is for
the Internet of things (IoT) which embraces a vast range of devices across multiple sectors. These
technologies are supplied primarily by a few countries, notably the United States, China and countries
in Western Europe.
As with previous waves of automation, frontier technologies are both destroying old jobs and creating
new ones. Current job expectations may be more pessimistic because of the increasing capacity of
AI to mimic human intelligence. Nevertheless, most alarmist scenarios often fail to take into account
that not all tasks in a job are automated, and, most importantly, that technology also creates new
products, tasks, professions, and economic activities throughout the economy. The net impact on jobs
will depend on the final balance between creation and extinction.
For these new technologies, the knowledge landscape is dominated by the United States and China, with
a combined 30 per cent share of global publications and almost 70 per cent of patents (Figure 2). Other
countries compete in specific categories, notably France, Germany, India, Japan, the Republic of Korea,
and the United Kingdom.

All these technologies are at the frontiers of change, but some are more mature than others, as is
evident by the record of patents and publications. On the basis of the years in which patents were
first sought and the period over which the original patents were subsequently cited, the most mature
technology is AI. Most patents for this technology were applied for in 2014 and cite patents on
average from 2005, producing a difference of around 9 years. This may seem counterintuitive. But
today’s AI patents, such as those for autonomous vehicles and the metaverse, are technologically
closer to those for search engines and digital maps, and many of the underlying principles patented
in 2005 are still valid.

Note:
For each technology, the number in the bar graph shows the patent maturity, which is the difference between the
weighted average patent application year and the weighted average year of the 20 most cited patents between
2000 and 2021.

IoT, on the other hand, is relatively immature, with an average patent application year of 2017 and an
average citation date of 2016. This suggests that the dominant design behind IoT innovation is being
updated almost yearly, reflecting a technology that is still evolving fast.
For developing countries that need to catch up, the more mature technologies may seem simpler and
more affordable options since they demand less research and development. Biomass and solar PV, for
example, have well- tested technologies that latecomers can absorb and use with imported machinery
from the outside. For solar PV, for example, China initially imported foreign production machinery and
benefited from economies of scale. However, these markets may now be more difficult to enter since
the incumbents will have developed strong and efficient production processes and are able to trade
internationally at more competitive prices.

3. LAYING THE FOUNDATIONS
If developing countries are to capture the economic gains associated with new technologies, their
firms must have the required capabilities. This includes not just scientific or technical skill, but also the
necessary policies, regulations, and infrastructure. To assess national preparedness to equitably use,
adopt and adapt frontier technologies, this report presents the 2023 results of the ‘readiness index’ that
combines indicators for ICT, skills, R&D, industrial capacity and finance. This ranking for 166 countries
is dominated by high-income economies, notably the United States, Sweden, Singapore, Switzerland,
and the Netherlands. The second quarter of the list includes emerging economies – notably Brazil, which

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2023

xvii

OPENING GREEN WINDOWS
Technological opportunities for a low-carbon world

is ranked at 40, China at 35, India at 46, the Russian Federation at 31, and South Africa at 56. China’s
lower-than-expected position in the ranking, when compared with its productive and innovative capacities
in frontier technologies, is due to urban- rural disparities in Internet coverage and broadband speed.
Further behind are countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, and Sub-Saharan Africa, which are the
least prepared to use, adopt and adapt frontier technologies and are at risk of missing current windows
of opportunity.
Data on individual components of the index highlights areas that need to be improved. Overall, developing
countries as a group have lower rankings for their indicators on ICT connectivity and skills. The LDCs,
LLDCs, and SIDS rank lower than 100 for all the indicators, with particular weaknesses in ICT infrastructure
and research & development.
The countries best placed to move to smart production are those with higher levels of skill and stronger
manufacturing industries. The figure below shows the balance between workforce skills and market
opportunities – based on high-skill and technology-intensive manufacturing exports as a percentage of
total exports, and high-skill employment as a percentage of the working population.

Windows opening and closing
For developing countries and specific renewable energy products, the rapidly changing technological
scene offers green windows of opportunity. Countries should take advantage of these now, if possible,
since they are likely to close as other countries take over the markets. Otherwise, they may be firmly
locked into fossil-fuel pathways, leaving the markets entirely to foreign investors. Much depends on the
national preconditions and capacities and willingness to take opportunities and respond strategically as
they arise.

OPENING GREEN WINDOWS
Technological opportunities for a low-carbon world

Looking at renewable energy technologies, there is significant variability in catch-up trajectories at the
sector and country level. The table below considers four scenarios – illustrating which windows have been
open, or are within reach, and countries and technologies that have taken advantage of them.

The best scenario is the one in which strong preconditions are combined with strong responses.
For green hydrogen in Chile, for example, the country has adequate preconditions and can show a
strong response in development of the technology. Brazil, on the other hand, is in a strong position for
biofuel. It has a long history of sugarcane cultivation and from the 1970s started to make significant
investments in the technologies, while creating demand, and establishing a supportive framework.
With that, the country has managed to catch up and become a global leader both in terms of
technology, usage of ethanol, and fuel exports.
However, the lack of strong preconditions does not mean that the window of opportunity is closed.
Much depends on the responses at different levels of government and the involvement of various public
and private stakeholders. For example, the Thai government addressed weak initial preconditions for
biofuel through strong policy responses.
Countries should surpass their initial constraints if they want to reap economic gains. While the
opportunities differ greatly from one renewable energy technology to another, there are two main
stages for countries switching green. The first is to identify and open windows of opportunity, based
on the availability of natural resources, such as favourable wind conditions, and using policies to
boost demand and national capacity to use or build the necessary technology. The second is to
assess what is needed to sustain the processes. There are also likely to be feedback loops requiring
regular adjustments.

OPENING GREEN WINDOWS
Technological opportunities for a low-carbon world

Pathways to more complex and sustainable production
The best direction for developing countries is to switch to products that are more complex,1 have
greater value added and lower carbon footprints.
In most low-income developing countries, economic diversification involves emulating industries in
more developed countries – a steady progression that builds on existing industries – it is thus ‘pathdependent.’ If a country already has the capacity for manufacturing medium and high technology
products, it is in a stronger position and can move in a number of directions. But if it is largely
producing primary products, it has fewer starting points. If basic technologies need to be learned or
transferred from abroad, then innovation is likely to require greater government support. But whatever
path they choose for switching green, governments in low and lower-middle-income developing
countries have to act fast and decisively; otherwise, they will be left further behind.
Generally, as countries move from agriculture to industry, and to medium and high-tech manufacturing,
complexity increases. But this does not necessarily lead to greener production. The less-complex
sectors that also have lower carbon footprint include textiles, vegetable products, foodstuffs and
footwear. The sectors that are more complex and have higher carbon footprints include chemicals
and allied industries, metals and mineral products. However, much will depend on the product mix,
because within each industry, one can find products in a range of carbon emissions - from below to
above the global average.
To help countries choose greener pathways UNCTAD has produced indices of economic complexity
and carbon footprints for 43,000 products exported in international markets. As the product mix
becomes more complex and more sophisticated, carbon emissions can fall per unit of GDP, though if
more products are being produced for more people total emissions will rise (Figure 5).

For selecting more complex and greener directions, governments should strengthen national
capacities for analysing new sectors (Figure 6). This will mean taking stock of the country’s existing
technological and productive capacities and the availability of natural resource such as wind or
agricultural waste. The evaluation can also take advantage of international tools, such as UNCTAD’s
Catalogue of Diversification Opportunities 2022. They also need to consider how they can fit into
global value chains. And as the windows of opportunity open, policymakers should be prepared to
adjust their institutional frameworks.

Twin transitions for global value chains – green and digital
For most countries their capacity for moving to complex and greener products will depend on trade –
on how they can fit into global value chains (GVCs). By participating in GVCs, countries can diversify
by producing and exporting parts and components of final products or by upgrading existing output
to have greater value added.
The greening of GVCs in manufacturing industries is driven by 1) national environmental legislation and
trade agreements including environmental provisions, 2) new patterns of demand preferences and
consumer behaviours, and 3) new technologies inducing efficiency gains to meet greener demand
requirements. These drivers can open green windows of opportunities for firms in latecomer countries
involved in GVCs, but seizing these opportunities is not automatic and the failure to do so may leave
enterprises worse off than before.
GVCs can become greener through two main routes. The first is by manufacturing the goods used for
green production, such as solar PV panels and wind turbines. The second is by greening traditional
manufacturing industries, such as food, garments and textiles, leather and shoes, and furniture.
Greening of traditional GVCs can be achieved by switching to digital frontier technologies associated
with smart manufacturing – often referred to as Industry 4.0. For example, data collected from onlineconnected sensors, and from GPS tracking systems, can optimize logistics and significantly reduce
carbon emissions.
So far, digital technologies have only diffused slowly in most of developing economies. Manufacturing
companies more likely to use Industry 4.0 technologies are found in the more advanced economies.
Countries with largely lower-skilled labour are less likely to benefit. There are also differences between
companies – in many developing countries, only a minority of larger companies tend to adopt
digital technologies; while the majority are still confined to analogue production. To promote the
twin transition of green and digital, latecomer countries will need to build digital competency along
with the necessary infrastructure and institutions, while building innovation capacity and overcoming
financial barriers.

OPENING GREEN WINDOWS
Technological opportunities for a low-carbon world

Within value chains, governments can consider targeted policies, such as support for small and
medium-size enterprises with finance for new machinery and other requirements for upgrading. They
can also create training or technology demonstration centres as well as industrial institutes.
As they upgrade, companies and countries should embed strong social and environmental values.
Social upgrading refers to improving the rights and entitlements of workers and their employment.
Environmental upgrading refers to a firm’s ecological footprint, including its use of natural resources,
its emission of greenhouse gases and its impact on biodiversity. These ideals are increasingly being
demanded by consumers who are seeking more ethical products, as well as by governments and
others who now have more exacting social and environmental standards.
Upgrading value chains can be based on voluntary sustainability standards (VSS) which have emerged
mainly through collaboration among NGOs, industry groups or multi-stakeholder groups. By 2020
there were 150 VSS in agriculture, and around 30 for mining and industrial products.

4. PRIORITIES FOR OPENING GREEN WINDOWS
For opening green windows, governments need to assess the current conditions and then strengthen
sectoral innovation systems. Much of this happens within ‘green industrial policy,’ which mainly
involves mobilizing the necessary actors and resources and directing how knowledge capacities are
upgraded – often amid considerable technological, economic, and political uncertainties.
The report identifies a set of priorities for latecomer countries. They can build digital competency
along with the necessary infrastructure and institutions, while strengthening innovation capacity
and overcoming financial barriers. This requires collaboration between the private sector and other
stakeholders.
A lead agency within government should mobilize resources and convene stakeholders to assess
overall state capacity in the areas related to the new technology, as well as the strengths of relevant
public agencies, particularly for regulation, extension support systems, and for providing required
public services. Overall policy should be mission-oriented – going beyond levelling the playing field
to fixing market failures and involving broader programmes of market co-creation and shaping.
In industries where the technology is more mature, as with wind and solar, it may be difficult
for latecomers to produce core components. But there can be opportunities further down the
value chain related to deployment, such as project development, engineering, procurement and
construction.
Governments need to assess at various stages where and how production and innovation should be
strengthened and changed. To do so, they can take advantage of UNCTAD’s Science, Technology
and Innovation Policy reviews which cover the activities of national and local governments, private
companies, universities, research institutes, financial institutions, and civil society organizations.
While the options differ from one country and company to another, there are some common priority
areas.

Set the direction
Align environmental and industrial policies
Governments need transformational agendas to mitigate climate change, commit to renewable energy
production and consumption, electrify rural communities, and increase energy security. Policies that
might previously have been developed in separate domains need to be co-created across the energyenvironmental and industrial spheres. This requires a whole-of-government approach involving
ministries of education, industry, trade, to cultivate design and engineering capabilities and prepare
the economy and businesses for responding.

xxii

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2023

OPENING GREEN WINDOWS
Technological opportunities for a low-carbon world

Invest in more complex and greener sectors
The government, the private sector and other stakeholders should develop the capacities and build the
institutions to continuously and strategically identify new technologies and sectors for diversification
that are more complex and greener. The priority sectors should be supported through vertical policy
instruments such as clusters, smart specialization initiatives, pilot and demonstration projects and
areas, and the associated finance.
The government and the private sector should also expand financing opportunities for developing
and commercializing green technologies. These can include Investment funds for green technology,
technical assistance in innovation and technology, and advisory services. To encourage the private
sector, both government and donor agencies should come forward as early investors. These activities
can be complemented by foreign direct investment.

Build consumer demand
Governments can offer the incentives and infrastructure that help shift consumer demand to encourage
recycling and the circular economy. This can be supported by green procurement to create a ripple effect
across the rest of the economy.

Build green productive and innovative capacities
Invest in R&D
Nascent green technologies usually require significant investments in R&D. Governments can offer
subsidies to build up research, with the collaboration of universities and industry, both domestic
and foreign. Public R&D investments are also needed in process improvements and complementary
technologies. And when technologies are rapidly evolving, as in the wind industry, this investment will
need to be continuous. In the early stages, when the domestic market cannot support a competitive
industry, governments can set up technology demonstration projects.

Raise awareness of green technologies
The government, private sector and other stakeholders should create greater awareness of the
potential of green technologies. This should start within basic education, along with campaigns to
inform the private sector and consumers of the benefits of these technologies and their capacity
to reduce carbon footprints. Within firms, technical education and skills development upskill and
prepare the manufacturing sector to adopt green technology.
Organized civil society is also important for sensitizing the public about the significance of green
technology. Civil society organization can support transfer of knowledge and capacity development
activities for farmers and other small businesses. They can also start pilot projects that can be
scaled- up by governments. Civil society organizations and the academia can serve as incubators
or accelerators for young entrepreneurs interested in starting businesses in green agricultural
technologies.

Develop digital infrastructure and skills
As these technologies progress, all countries will need stronger digital infrastructure, in particular
high-speed and high-quality Internet connections. This will mean public and private investments
in ICT infrastructure along with regulations to foster competition in the telecommunications sector.
Governments should also address the connectivity gaps between small and large firms and between
urban and rural regions. Some technologies, such as drones, may also need specific regulations.
Skills are needed for adopting existing technologies, for basic use, for adapting these technologies, and
finally for creating new ones. For developing countries, it is particularly important to have the capacity to
adapt and modify technologies since these are likely to be used in circumstances different from those
in which they were originally developed.

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2023

OPENING GREEN WINDOWS
Technological opportunities for a low-carbon world

Governments should support businesses, including SMEs, to help them build digital skills in areas such
as market research, product development, sourcing, production, sales, and after-sales services. Special
consideration should be given to women in informal and artisanal small and microenterprises, particularly
for entrepreneurs. Countries also need to reduce brain drain, retain skilled professionals, and attract skilled
expatriates.

5. INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION FOR MORE SUSTAINABLE
PRODUCTION
In developing countries, opening green windows is unlikely to happen naturally as a result of businesses
seeking greater efficiency and profits; it has to be the consequence of deliberate government action.
The least technologically able countries cannot seize green opportunities without the support of the
international community and official development assistance. This should be based on equitable
partnerships – to build local innovation capabilities and marshal the necessary technologies.
Collaboration on innovation not only transfers capital goods and equipment, it also enables people to
develop the skills needed to operate and maintain the equipment (know-how) and understand why it
is running (know-why). Green technologies typically need more adaptation to local conditions.
Empowering developing countries for switching green thus requires broad and comprehensive
development strategies that can deal with multiple tensions and develop partnerships for common
public goods.

Cooperation through international trade
Given the extent to which the production and consumption of products related to green technology
are traded internationally, much will depend on the conditions on which this trade takes place. Trade
rules should, for example, permit developing countries to protect infant green industries through
tariffs, subsidies and public procurement – so that they not only meet local demand but reach the
economies of scale that make exports more competitive. There should also be requirements for
local content though these need to be carefully managed and deliberately sequenced so as to
avoid the pitfalls that earlier industrial policies faced in most developing countries.
To support these efforts, the World Trade Organization can review trade rules to make them more
consistent with the Paris Agreement. However, member countries can also take steps within existing
WTO rules. Countries with larger domestic markets, for example, can subsidize nascent sectors
for components for domestic solar and wind energy products. They can thus start producing for
import replacement while strengthening capacity for exports, by improving trade facilitation, and
ensuring a stable and competitive exchange rates that would have effects similar to those of export
subsidies.
The international community should also be innovative and propose new and bold trade mechanisms
to support the development of innovation and technological capacity in developing countries for
cleaner and more productive production. Developed countries can use development assistance
to help countries to emulate the production of more advanced countries. On the demand side,
developed countries should open their markets to production from latecomer economies. Identifying
the products and countries that should benefit from such a proposal would, however, probably need
a new institutional structure. A pilot could be an international programme of guaranteed purchase
of tradable green items – such as products, parts and components used for renewable energy.

Reform of intellectual property rights
When the developed economies were producing new products and catching up with Britain after the
Industrial revolution, or when a few Asian countries started upgrading their productive and innovative
capacities – they were often copying production processes with or without permission. Now the

xxiv

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2023

OPENING GREEN WINDOWS
Technological opportunities for a low-carbon world

intellectual property rights (IPR) regime is tighter, making it harder for new producers to break in.
The international IPR system should be reformed to enable governments in developing countries to
manage their systems to support climate action, based on the needs of different sectors and different
stages of development. Manufacturers in technologically weak and less diversified countries should
be allowed to imitate the production of more technologically advanced economies.
The principle that sustainable development should take precedence over commercial objectives was
demonstrated during the COVID-19 crisis. In 2022, the WTO allowed eligible Members until 2027 to
produce and supply vaccines without the consent of the patent holder to the extent necessary to
address the COVID-19 pandemic. Similarly, flexibilities in the TRIPS Agreement should be given for
environmentally-sound technologies to make the trade regime more consistent with climate change
agreements.

Partners for green technology
Global efforts should be put in place to accelerate the development and deployment of green
technologies under the philosophy of common contributions to common goods. One groundbreaking model for this approach is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Others
are the Paris Agreement of 2015 and the agreements for the Sustainable Development Goals. Even
under such an approach, governance mechanisms should be put in place to avoid the North-South
divide in knowledge management and ensure that developing countries’ views and priorities are fully
considered.
There are also successful examples of collective research whose results belong to all participating
countries, particularly in natural sciences, including the European Organization for Nuclear Research
(CERN), the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) and the Square Kilometre Array
(SKAO) project. Similar collaborations can also shape international cooperation for green innovations
that equitably incorporate the views and priorities of developing countries.

Multilateral and open innovation
Most science, technology and innovation efforts are governed at the national level and generally
reflect the priorities of developed countries. The international community can offset this bias by
shifting research from the national to the multinational level. Such research should be based on open
innovation – with all the results available to international experts and knowledge communities. A
useful model is the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research.
Multilateral research can cover the whole value chain, or just a part of it. Research institutions could,
for example, bring products or processes close to technology maturity and invite private companies
to take care of rapid deployment. Or they might take concepts only to the laboratory stage or to early
demonstration projects.

Assessing technologies
Most technologies can have both positive and negative consequences depending on the local context
and on how they are used. Each country needs to be able to assess the benefits and dangers of each
technology according to their own needs, priorities and concerns. To date, technologies have largely
been assessed either from the perspective of the developed countries or emerging economies.
UNCTAD is currently carrying out pilot projects involving three African countries to build capacity for
technology assessment. What is needed however is a more general multilateral system for assessing
new technologies – such as AI and gene editing – based on the opportunities and risks they offer
to different types of country. It could also consider how developing countries can be systematically
supported to use such technologies.

Regional and South-South cooperation in science, technology and
innovation
Technological innovations to address the global climate crisis should increasingly be generated at
transnational or even global levels. However, cooperation has been limited, even in issues in which
countries in the same region often face similar problems. Researchers and investors in the poorer
countries have little incentive to cooperate with their regional peers and are more likely to enter
research projects with developed countries and emerging economies which can offer access worldclass research and laboratories as well as computing power. Moreover, small and vulnerable countries
also have limited domestic markets to attract local or international investment in the manufacture of
goods related to green innovation. More technologically advanced developing countries should step
up and strengthen efforts to promote regional and South-South cooperation for green innovation.
Developed countries can support regional centres of excellence for green technologies and innovation
– such as the Southern African Science Service Centre for Climate Change and Adaptive Land
Management (SASSCAL) and West African Science Service Centre on Climate Change and Adapted
Land Use (WASCAL).

A multilateral challenge fund “Innovations for Our Common Future”
Successful innovation systems create multiple incentives for companies and entrepreneurs to develop
their own ideas and transfer them to practice. However, most developing countries lack the financial
or management capacities to develop similar incentives. This Report proposes therefore a multilateral
challenge fund “Innovations for our common future.” Funded by international organizations, donors
and international philanthropy the fund would mobilize creative thinking and stimulate innovations that
could respond to many global challenges. The next step would be to design a global green innovation
competition. The criteria for assessing projects would be the extent to which they incorporate NorthSouth and South-South STI cooperation for green innovation.

Green windows of opportunity

In 2023, the world faces severe social and economic challenges. While trying to recover from the COVID-19
pandemic, many countries are now coping with the repercussions of the war in Ukraine, which has not
only caused immense suffering but has also heightened geopolitical tensions and created threats to global
trade, and to energy and food security.
Hovering over this sombre conjuncture is the climate crisis. As indicated in Figure I1, rises in per capita
incomes have historically been accompanied by higher CO2 emissions. Now, governments need to raise
the incomes of the poor while also limiting carbon emissions. They must therefore make complex tradeoffs between competing policy priorities – between promoting inclusive economic growth and protecting
the planet.

Notes:

The most difficult choices are in developing countries where this conjuncture of crises threatens hardwon development gains. They need more diverse and more productive economies to create more and
better jobs, boost household incomes and reduce poverty. But faster economic growth will demand far
more energy which, if sourced from fossil fuels, would send millions of tons of carbon billowing into the
atmosphere.
Moreover, repeating the historical patterns of growth would further widen inequality. Before the industrial
revolution, average incomes at the national level were similar across the world. Subsequently, as
highlighted in the 2021 Technology and Innovation Report, national incomes started to diverge, widening
the gap between the developed countries at the core of the world economy and the developing countries
at the periphery.1 A hotter climate will affect everyone – rich and poor. And rising poverty and inequality will
further heighten tensions within and between countries.

OPENING GREEN WINDOWS
Technological opportunities for a low-carbon world

Developing countries need not, however, follow the historical pathways of carbon-fuelled growth – if
the global community is committed to equitable social, economic and technological transformations
guided by the Sustainable Development Goals.
This report focuses specifically on technological innovation. It does not suggest that these problems
will be solved by technology alone, nor that new technology is necessarily beneficial – since the gains
for one group can be detrimental for others. New technologies can destroy habitats, for example,
or polarize societies, leaving many people further behind. But it does argue that innovation and
advances in science and technology, if guided by the Sustainable Development Goals, can be used
to drive the world along more sustainable and equitable pathways, particularly in the generation
and use of energy. Developing countries need to open green windows now, at the beginning of the
technological transformation, so that they can benefit from technological innovation and have a
voice on the direction and pace of change, otherwise they will be once again left behind.
The report is built around the concept of green innovation – creating or introducing new or improved
goods and services that leave lighter carbon footprints and open up green windows of opportunity
that can help developing countries to catch up, achieve the SDGs, reduce poverty, tackle climate
change and set the world on a more sustainable course. In terms of technology, developing countries
typically lag behind richer countries. But as latecomers they can profit from earlier experiences,
skipping some intermediate stages, and following their own trajectories and paths.2
For these transformations, developing countries should also rely on support from the more
technologically advanced countries. In the past such assistance has been considered “technology
transfer.” In practice however, often firms have transferred manufacturing equipment with just
enough training to operate it. Technology now needs to be transferred more through innovation
cooperation – through equitable partnerships that evolve with changing technological needs and
capabilities and with shifts in international political and economic landscapes. This will require new
policies for innovation, along with new business models and approaches to financing.3
A report on these issues could be very wide in scope. It could, for example, consider how frontier
technologies can affect climate change mitigation and adaptation, and how to balance the positive
and negative sides of this transformation. Or it could address the impacts of greener products on
inequality and elaborate on the important principals of the circular economy.
In the interests of brevity, however, the report focusses primarily on three topics, building on
the recommendation of the Technology and Innovation Report 2021 for developing countries to
“adopt frontier technologies while continuing to diversify their production bases by mastering many
existing technologies.” First, developing renewable energy technologies. Second, applying frontier
technologies to greener global value chains. Third, diversifying towards sectors that have lower
carbon footprints. These topics are addressed across six chapters:
Chapter I – Green windows of opportunity – Describes the process of catch-up using green
windows.
Chapter II – Moving fast with frontier technologies – With a special focus on green technologies and
the preparations needed.
Chapter III – Growth powered by renewable energy - Examines the production of renewable energy
in developing countries and provides insights on the opportunities for these countries to forge
ahead in green sectors and related value chains.
Chapter IV – Twin transitions for global value chains – green and digital – How developing countries
can use frontier technologies to go digital and go green.
Chapter V – Pathways to more complex and sustainable production – How developing countries
can diversify their economies towards sectors with lower carbon emissions.

Green windows of opportunity

Chapter VI – International collaboration for more sustainable production – How international
cooperation can transfer technology to and foster innovation in developing countries.

A. GREEN INNOVATION
Green innovation has its roots in the idea of a ‘green techno-economic paradigm’ first presented 25 years
ago by economist Christopher Freeman. A techno-economic paradigm can be defined as a set of
“common-sense guidelines for technological and investment decisions as pervasive new technologies
mature.”4 A sustainable new techno-economic paradigm involves switching to greener technologies and
modes of production.
Typically, each new techno-economic paradigm arises within the existing paradigm and may take 30 to
60 years to fully diffuse.5 The current information and communications technologies (ICT) paradigm was
born the early 1970s. The embryonic green paradigm is also benefitting from advances in ICT but more
fully embraces digital technologies.6
Once a technological revolution matures, financial capital will explore the opportunities for higher
profits, either by extending the paradigm to other countries or by investing in the development of further
technologies, creating fresh technological waves.
Typically, these waves reach developing countries after a delay – arriving initially in the form of consumer
goods as, for example, with the introduction of smartphones and e-commerce. Only later have developing
countries applied new technologies to their own production, through investment by multinational
companies and later by domestic firms. The outcome is a patchwork of elements of different paradigms
at different stages of diffusion in various sectors of the economy.7
Developing countries need not, however, wait for new technologies to arrive. They can start to ride the
waves of technology in their earlier stages, using these advances to restructure their economies and to
grow more rapidly (Box I-1). If they miss the earlier stages of a technological wave there is always the risk
of falling irretrievably behind.8
Catching up requires more than simple imitation; it demands creative adaptation and innovation.
As a result, current catch-up pathways differ substantially from those taken by technologically advanced
economies.
Figure I2 illustrates four main components of catch-up based on green innovation. The starting point is
experimenting with new ideas and technologies and adapting these to local circumstances, values and
priorities (Figure I2). To take advantage of these ideas, they will need the appropriate infrastructure in the
form of public goods which often require direct government intervention, supporting the establishment
of new green sectors, for example, or introducing regulations such as on air or water pollution.9 These
public goods are freely available to all – they are non-excludable. Green innovation is also influenced by
global agendas, rules, and mechanisms, especially, those related to climate change such as the Paris
Agreement.

Box I 1
Overlapping technological waves
Technological changes can be very uneven and often arrive in overlapping waves. In the chart below, technological
paradigm A reaches peripherical countries only when it has already matured in core countries. It first affects infrastructure
and consumption patterns and only later is deployed in the production sectors. The pattern is similar for technological
revolution B, which has yet to reach the production sectors of peripherical countries.
This pattern can be broken if developing countries take advantage of the emergence of a new technological revolution
at its beginning. In technological revolution C, they actively take part in the installation phase – strategically and actively
promoting:
a) Changes in domestic consumption pattern towards products related to the new paradigm
b) Installation and diffusion of the required infrastructure, and
c) Diffusion of the new technologies and related innovation in their domestic productive sectors.

B. CREATING GREEN WINDOWS
Green windows are time-bounded opportunities that arise from changes in public institutions and policy
interventions, markets, and technologies.10 Previous opportunities have depended largely on external
technology11 or market changes,12 but green windows of opportunity arise mainly within countries.
Created by public institutions – Green windows of opportunities are often institutional – promoted by
public actions and related adjustments to the institutional framework conditions (rules, regulations,
policies, etc). In Brazil, for example, the 1973 oil crisis triggered industrial policies to promote the use
of biofuels. Similarly, in China in 2006 a renewable energy law stimulated the initial development of the

6

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2023

CHAPTER I
Green windows of opportunity

biomass industry,13 which was supported by solar energy ‘missions’ such as the Rooftop Subsidy and
the Golden Sun Demonstration Programs.14 In Egypt, the 2014 Renewable Energy Law encouraged the
private sector to produce more electricity from renewable resources. In the Philippines, the Renewable
Energy Act of 2008 provided incentives for adopting new technologies.15
Created by domestic markets – Governments have been stimulating local demand for green products, for
example, by feed-in tariffs aimed at creating competitive parity between green energies and fossil fuels.
In India, the "Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles" plan stimulates the purchase and
the deployment of charging infrastructure.16 In the Philippines, the Green Public Procurement Roadmap
aims to integrate the sustainability criteria in the public procurement process.17 In China in 2013, the
““Guiding Opinions on Accelerating the Promotion of the Application of New Energy Vehicles” provided
purchase subsidies for electric vehicles, supported by the 2015 “Guidelines for Accelerating the Plug-in
Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Deployment”.18 Local producers can also consider exports, but
many green energy products are not readily tradable.
Created by research and development – Governments can also invest in public R&D programmes.
Some examples are the wind offshore demonstration projects in China,19 the demonstration project on
the deployment of solar energy systems in rural health units in the Philippines,20 and the governmental
support for R&D, experimental proof and technology demonstration projects on Clean Energy in India. 21
Throughout these processes, policymakers have to strike balances. They need to encourage local
enterprises by subsidizing products, but if these capabilities are not to remain dormant, they must also
stimulate market demand. At the same they must avoid the trap of stimulating green domestic sectors
without corresponding investment in technical change, such that firms in developing countries may
become market leaders but remain as technology followers.22 Such institutional-cum-demand windows
have been most effective for energy generation as with the use of solar PV in Brazil, China, and India
which have large internal markets.

C. ALERT AND READY FOR CHANGE
If developing countries are to catch up, they should be alert to opportunities. This applies both to
the policymakers and to firms and supporting institutions, such as universities, research centres, and
standards organizations.23 The firms most likely to be ready and alert are those operating in the same
or closely related sectors.24
Readiness to seize opportunities has enabled some companies to become national champions. In
China for example, this includes Dragon Power in the production of biomass, Suntec for solar PV,
and Goldwind for wind technologies. Such firms can then expand to international markets – whether
through licensing production overseas or establishing overseas subsidiaries. Goldwin’s and Envisions’
R&D subsidiaries in Europe, for example, established links with foreign universities and benefited
from the recruitment of very experienced engineers.25 These enterprises also expanded by buying
companies in developed countries. For example, Dragon Power’s acquisition of a Danish company
was crucial for its leadership in the international biomass sector.26
In mature sectors, it is relatively easy for firms to acquire world-class technologies, and market success
depends more on capital investment in organizational capabilities. In China, for example, following
the 2006 renewable energy law, companies licensed core technologies and production plant designs
for biomass and wind, mainly from European firms.27 Similarly, for solar PV production capability they
used foreign technologies to manufacture solar panels using globally dominant designs.28
In the domestic industry, innovation diffuses from first-movers to followers. In China, a relatively weak
intellectual property regime has allowed knowledge to spill over from the leading companies to other
domestic firms in related industries.29

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2023

OPENING GREEN WINDOWS
Technological opportunities for a low-carbon world

Within specific sectors there can be intense interactions among lead firms, suppliers, technology
providers, and financial institutions.30 During the more demanding stages of technological upgrading,
these contribute to technological deepening, as happened in the Chinese solar PV industry.31
Firm-level initiatives need to be supported by national institutions, particular in government and
in universities – for example, through public R&D investments in process improvements and the
application of complementary technologies.32 In China, for wind power, university-industry collaboration
facilitated the shift from onshore to offshore turbine technologies.33
For each of these sectors, the innovation system must continuously adapt to changing market and
technological opportunities and take into account the different impacts and influences on men and
women.
A key to all of this is smart sequencing. Typically, environmental and energy policies create demand
which is then filled through industrial and innovation policies. For instance, the strategy may aim
to create a demand through subsidies and price incentives for renewable energy, followed by a
subsequent law allocating a share of domestic content for components in wind turbines.34 Or
conversely, in the case of the global shift from combustion engines to electric vehicles, innovation
and industrial policies can support domestic design and manufacturing. Transportation policy then
encourages domestic diffusion, followed by preparation for exports.35

D. CATCH-UP TRAJECTORIES
Catch-up refers to shifts in the balance of economic power between incumbents and latecomers, and
can be driven by markets or technologies.
Market catch-up – This can start with government policies that stimulate a domestic market that
can be satisfied by local products.36 In renewable energy this may be quantified and measured as
the share of energy generation capacity (in megawatts) sold and installed by domestic producers
in the domestic and global markets. In other sectors, such as EV, it can be measured by domestic
producers' number of units sold in domestic and global markets. Global market catch-up means
achieving internationally competitive quality and prices for green products, such as wind turbines
and solar PV panels, and related services. Marketplaces are small for certain pre-competitive, still
immature technologies, such as concentrated solar power and green hydrogen.
Technological catch-up – To a significant degree, this relies on capabilities based on pre-existing
knowledge and routines and strengthened by user-producer interactions.37 There is however a
distinction between technology that is new-to-the-country and world-class technology at the global
knowledge frontier.38 Both types interact during the latecomer development process since a closer
connection to larger and more sophisticated markets may provide critical knowledge for technology
improvements.39 In addition, more robust technological capabilities may increase the competitiveness
of national firms in the home and export markets.40 However, this outcome is not automatic. A certain
degree of technological capability attainment may enable domestic market development but may
be insufficient for export competitiveness. Conversely, demand-led domestic development may
help catch up in production capability, but not technological catch-up, which depends on firm-level
advantages provided by access to lead markets.41
The next chapter assesses the current state of countries’ technological capabilities in Industry 4.0
and green technologies.

Although the current ICT paradigm and the digital
economy was very much spurred by public
sector programmes and benefited from large
investments in the military sector, much less
deliberate direction was given by public policies.
In fact, the digital economy is to a large extent an
unintentional by-product, or positive externality, of
investments in the military-industrial complex in the
US, even if the state also sought to commercialise
the outcomes of these investments. See also

Moving fast with frontier technologies

This chapter examines frontier technologies – new and rapidly developing technologies that take
advantage of digitalization and connectivity – highlighting their potential economic benefits. It also
assesses country capabilities to use, adopt, and adapt these innovations.
As indicated in Figure II-1, the chapter focuses on 17 technologies divided into three broad categories:
Industry 4.0, green and renewable energy technologies, and other frontier technologies. Nevertheless,
these categories also intersect and overlap. For instance, drones are not classified here as a green
frontier technology, though delivery by drone can cut GHG emissions due to their lower energy
consumption per package when compared to vehicles.1 Similarly, nanotechnology can improve the
use of renewable sources, for example, by enabling lighter rotor blades for wind turbines.2

These technologies have experienced tremendous growth in the last two decades and will continue to
affect economic and social structures, offering possibilities for market growth and a chance for economies
to develop their labour markets. In addition, countries that have the required capabilities can enter and
develop new sectors like renewable energy sources or EVs, opening green windows to drive their economic
growth. Nonetheless, developing economies have to optimize their preparedness and close the gaps for
the use, adoption, and adaptation of frontier technologies. The readiness index included in this chapter
can help countries do so using an evidence-based approach.

A. TECHNOLOGIES IN THE FAST LANE
Frontier technologies have experienced tremendous growth in the last two decades.3 In 2020 their
market value was $1.5 trillion and by 2030 could reach $9.5 trillion (Figure II-2). For comparison, over this
period the global market for smartphones is expected only to double, from $508 billion to $983 billion.4
But it is important to note that these estimates may be inflated by double counting – for instance, many
IoT technologies also involve the deployment of AI and big data.

Around half the market value of these technologies is for the Intern of things (IoT) which embraces a vast
range of devices that are ubiquitous across multiple sectors. Industry 4.0 has accelerated the use of
these multiple interconnected devices – from Tesla’s automotive factories to Amazon’s warehouses to IoT
devices in sustainable aquaculture.6 By 2030, IoT revenues could reach $4.4 trillion.7
There is also a rapidly expanding market for AI, which by 2030 might be contributing between $13 trillion
and $16 trillion to the global economy.8 Growth is driven by continued technical improvements in multiple
sectors, such as AI-enabled self-programming robots for manufacturing, and AI-based software in
financial investment, trading, and loan screening. AI is also improving urban service delivery in smart cities
and drone delivery – by directing semi-autonomous vehicles, cars, trucks, and buses, in which drivers are
assisted by cameras, radar, and navigation systems.9
Between 2020 and 2030, the market revenues for electric vehicles (EVs) could increase from $163 billion
to $824 billion. This growth is being driven primarily by demands from consumers who wish to reduce
their carbon footprints but are also responding to rising prices for gasoline and diesel that have arisen from
geopolitical instability. This demand is now being met by many more suppliers, including companies who
previously only produced vehicles with internal combustion engines. Greater competition has reduced
prices, encouraging better charging infrastructure, and supportive government regulations and incentives.
The numbers in Figure II-2 are significantly higher than those given in the previous Technology and Innovation
Report. This is partly because this report adds six more green technologies but also because the use of
several technologies accelerated after the COVID-19 pandemic and triggered more rapid digitalization.10 For
the global investment promotion agencies, ICT is now reported as the second most important industry, with
technologies like blockchain, big data, 5G, and IoT as the main choices for online activities.11
Frontier technologies are supplied primarily from a few countries, notably the United States, China, and
countries in Western Europe (Table II-1). The biggest providers of Industry 4.0 technologies are from the
United States which is home to major computing platforms that offer a wide range of one-stop, pay-asyou-go services.12 Companies from China are particularly active in 5G, drone technology, and solar PV.
Robotics and green frontier technologies suppliers, on the other hand are more evenly spread among
developed economies in Western Europe and East Asia, where companies have benefitted from favourable
regulation and rising demand for renewable energy. Only two of the top frontier technology providers are
from developing economies, and both are in the renewables sector. Firms in these countries urgently need
more government support if they are to operate more effectively close to technological frontiers.

OPENING GREEN WINDOWS
Technological opportunities for a low-carbon world

Given the multiple overlaps between various technologies, it is difficult to arrive at market sizes.
A more accurate way of evaluating each is to project the value they add to the global economy.
Some estimates for 5G, for example, suggest that between 2022 and 2030 its economic contribution
will increase from $150 billion to $1.3 trillion.13 Similarly, by 2030 AI could be adding $13 trillion to
global economic output – 1.2 per cent of global GDP, while IoT could be adding between $5.5 trillion
and $12.6 trillion.14 Finally, blockchain is estimated to generate $176 billion of value by 2025 and
$3.1 trillion by 2030.15

1. CREATION AND EXTINCTION OF JOBS
As with previous waves of automation, frontier technologies have both destroyed old jobs and created
new ones.16 Current job expectations may be more pessimistic because of the increasing capacity of AI to
mimic human intelligence and recent job cuts by some big technology companies, nevertheless the alarmist
scenarios often fail to take fully into account that not all tasks in a job are automated, and, most importantly,
that technology also creates new products, tasks, professions, and economic activities throughout the
economy.17 The net impact on jobs will depend on the final balance between creation and extinction.18

Industry 4.0 frontier technologies
AI – A study in the United States using data on online job vacancies found that between 2010 and 2019
demand for AI skills rose sharply across most industries and occupations. The highest demand was in
IT occupations, followed by architecture, engineering, scientific and management occupations.19
Big data – There is a booming demand for data scientists in the United States. Between 2020 and
2030 there are expected to be 7,100 job openings, with annual job growth projected at 15 per cent or
higher.20
Blockchain – Between 2020 and 2021, on Indeed.com the number of postings for blockchain jobs
doubled.21 Blockchain developers continue to be remunerated well, with an estimated annual income
in the United States of $136,000, in Asia of $87,500 and in Europe of $73,300. The five biggest
blockchain employers are Deloitte, IBM, Accenture, Cisco, and Collins Aerospace.22
Drones – Between 2020 and 2040, in Australia, on average drones are expected to support 5,500 fulltime job equivalents per annum.23 Meanwhile between 2013 and 2025 the United States should add
more than 100,000 drone-related jobs. The top three drone job locations are the United States, China,
and France.24
5G – Between 2022 and 2034, around 4.6 million 5G-related jobs will be created in the United States,
driven largely by employment in agriculture, construction, utilities, manufacturing, transportation and
warehousing, education, healthcare, and government.25 By 2035, the global 5G value chain is expected
to support 22 million jobs.26
3D printing – Additive manufacturing is demanding more skilled professionals, such as engineers,
software developers, material scientists and a wide range of business support functions including sales,
marketing, and other specialists. In the United States, it is estimated that 3D printing will add between
three and five million new skilled jobs in the next decade.27
IoT – The growth of IoT has led to skills shortages. According to one study, between July 2021 and April
2022 the number of online job ads that included IoT increased by one-third.28 LinkedIn data suggest
more than 13,000 IoT-related job openings in the United States.29
Robotics – Job growth in robotics is more modest. In the United States, in 2016 there were
132,500 robotics engineers and the job market for this professional type is expected to grow by 6.4 per
cent between 2016 and 2026.30 Robotics careers include robotics engineers, software developers,
technicians, sales engineers, and operators.31

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2023

CHAPTER II
Moving fast with frontier technologies

Green frontier technologies
Biofuels – Worldwide, the liquid biofuel market employs an estimated 2,411,000 people.32 Although
biofuel jobs declined between 4 and 5 per cent in the United States in 2020 because of the Covid-19
pandemic, the demand for workers is projected to rebound.33
Biogas and biomass – Job markets will keep growing. Biomass is estimated to create 73 permanent fulltime direct jobs per 100MW of installation capacity. Solid biomass employs around 765,000 individuals
worldwide, while biogas employs approximately 339,000 people.34
Solar PV – Solar PV is the largest contributor to employment among the renewable energy industries,
accounting for almost four million jobs worldwide.35 Solar energy jobs are set to grow rapidly but
there is little evidence of solar hiring boom. Growth in the solar energy sector has been slowed by
political and industry turbulence due to regulatory uncertainty and the bankruptcy and layoffs of big
companies due to lower prices and shifts in the technology, making old ones obsolete.36
Concentrated solar power – Worldwide, the concentrated solar power industry has created
an estimated 32,000 jobs.37 In the best-case scenario, concentrated solar projects could create
100,000 to 130,000 new jobs by 2025. Of these, 45,000 would be permanent roles in operations
and maintenance.38
Wind energy – The job market is expected to experience rapid growth. Wind energy currently employs
an estimated 1,254,000 people worldwide,39 and another 3.3 million direct jobs are expected to be
created by 2025 as a result of additional 470GW of wind capacity.40
Green hydrogen – Between 2030 and 2050, green hydrogen is expected to create as many as
two million jobs, through investments in electrolysers and other green hydrogen infrastructure.41
Electric vehicles – Electrifying the transportation industry is expected to result in net job growth. In
Europe by 2030 around 200,000 permanent jobs could be created to provide EV infrastructure – for
battery manufacturing, charger manufacturing, installation of the chargers, grid connections, and
charge point operations.42 Likewise, by 2035 globally there could be more than two million net jobs.43

Other frontier technologies
Nanotechnology – The nanotechnology job market is expected to expand at a modest rate. In the
United States, the nanotechnology engineer job market is set to grow by 6.4 per cent between 2016
and 2026.44
Gene editing – Labour demand in gene editing is expected to soar, especially in developed countries. In
the United Kingdom, an estimated 18,000 new jobs will be added between 2017 and 2035,45 while in the
United States, medical scientists and biomedical engineers together are expected to add 22,500 jobs
between 2021 and 2031.46

2. KNOWLEDGE ON FRONTIER TECHNOLOGIES
Over the past two decades, frontier technologies have generated increasing interest amongst
academics and innovators. The number of associated publications and patents has soared (Figure II-3
and Figure II-4). Particularly high volumes are evident in Industry 4.0 – for AI, 438,619 publications
and 214,365 patents; for robotics, 276,027 publications and 122,940 patents; and for IoT,
139,805 publications and 147,906 patents. In green frontier technologies in 2000-2021: for electric
vehicles 79,732 publications and 206,049 patents; and for wind energy 37,514 publications and
58,134 patents.
The knowledge landscape is dominated by the United States and China with a combined 30 per
cent share of global publications and almost 70 per cent of patents (Figure II-5, Figure II-6, and
Box II-1). Other countries compete in specific categories, notably India, the Republic of Korea,
Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and Japan.

Box II 1
China and the United States dominate patents on frontier technologies
For 14 of the 17 categories of frontier technology, the United States and China are the two largest sources of
published research and are always in the top three. They are also the top sources of patent assignees in nine and
make up two of the top three in seven categories. China is absent only in concentrated solar power – which is
the smallest of the categories.
Over the period 2000-2021, China has been particularly dominant in Industry 4.0 and green frontier technologies,
accounting for approximately half of all patents. China produced a total of 536,115 patented technologies, which
included IoT (100,958 patents), AI (71,055 patents) and big data (62,063 patents). Over the same period, the
United States, generated 169,447 patents, which includes robotics (49,318 patents), AI (43,193 patents) and
electric vehicles (19,523 patents).
China places technological development as a priority. In the 14th five-year plan, for example, it aims to reach
an average annual growth rate of 20 per cent of the number of robots, form a group of leading enterprises that
are internationally competitive, build industrial clusters, and double the intensity of robots in manufacturing.47
According to a study, the country is the leader in granted patents in robotics considering the period between
2005 and 2019, accounting for 35 per cent of the total. Others in the top of this ranking are Japan, the Republic
of Korea and the United States.48
The gap between China and the United States in patent is even wider in green frontier technologies. China has
56 per cent of overall patents for these innovations, and the United States only 9 per cent. Over the past two
decades, firms in China created 33,066 patents for wind energy while firms in the United States generated just
2,963 patents. In solar panels, China created 31,365 patents, while the United States generated 1,586. China’s
domination reflects the priority status given since 2012 to green technologies in its patent examination system, as
well as the determination of policymakers to create a hospitable environment for green innovation.

The data shown here highlights the concentration of knowledge creation for these frontier technologies.
The accumulated knowledge in countries such as the United States, China, India, and United Kingdom
needs to be shared with countries in the Global South, especially LDCs, LLDCs, and SIDS, through
international cooperation and multilateral forums and initiatives. Key indicators for the frontier technologies
covered in this report are shown in Table II-2. Detailed information is presented in Annex A.

3. TRADE EXPANSION
One of the main channels for innovation transfer is trade. This can happen through the imports of capital
goods as well as contact with export markets which favours learning-by doing and increases the scope
for imitation.49 Figure II-7 illustrates the increases in trade for solar PV and electric vehicles. For example,
the exports of electric vehicles of the top 15 exporter countries jumped from $ 28 billion in 2018 to
$ 105 billion in 2021. Considering green technologies, total exports of developed economies jumped
from around $ 60 billion in 2018 to over $ 156 billion in 2021, while imports went from $ 89 billion
to $ 188 billion. In the same period, exports of developing countries increased from $ 57 billion to
$ 75 billion, while imports jumped from $ 48 billion to 63 billion.

CHAPTER II
Moving fast with frontier technologies

Among the developing countries, trade is greater for solar PV, following the drop in prices between 2010
and 2015, with an average reduction of 65 per cent in the expense of employing utility-scale solar PV.50
Market expansion has translated into further efficiency-led cost reductions, opening up more options for
developing countries.
Developing countries have less trade in EVs than in solar PV. This could reflect the fact that the former is
a less mature technology, as explored in greater levels of detail in Chapter 3. In general, more immature
technologies require greater efforts in terms of science and R&D, which tends to be lower in developing
economies, as shown previously. There are also cost and infrastructure-related barriers to the broader EV
adoption in developing economies. In addition, for oil-reliant countries, EV trade has been limited by the
political economy of fossil fuels and the transition to renewables needs a nuanced approach that balances
sustainability with economic stability and poverty alleviation.51

B. THE EXPANSION OF GREEN FRONTIER TECHNOLOGIES
Economies that depend on fossil fuel imports will need to move towards renewable energy sources that
allow for greater energy autonomy and self-sufficiency, especially given the recent increase in energy
prices due to geopolitical events. These same forces also push the faster adoption of electrified transport
than previously anticipated.
As indicated in Figure II-8, installed capacity of renewable energy is dominated by wind and solar.52

and 2020, the installed capacity for all three sources increased in middle- and low-income countries which
now host over 50 per cent of total installed capacity – with a notable growth in the share for solar energy,
which grew from 3 to 51 per cent.

These expansions are mainly driven by China, which is now the leading country globally, and is being
joined by lower-middle-income countries such as Viet Nam and India, and upper-middle-income countries
like Brazil and Thailand. With Africa possessing the world’s greatest renewable energy capacity potential,
estimated to reach 310GW by 2030, there is scope for significant progress if encouraged by public policy.
Figure II-10 shows the distribution of installed capacity for bioenergy, solar and wind, indicating the
increasing participation of developing economies. Given political will, there is scope for significant progress,
with the prospect of greater energy security and many new jobs.54

OPENING GREEN WINDOWS
Technological opportunities for a low-carbon world

As EV and green hydrogen are the most recent markets, they are examined in greater detail in the following
sections.

1. GREEN HYDROGEN
Green hydrogen, also called clean hydrogen, refers to hydrogen produced through the electrolysis of
water, using energy sourced from renewables. When used as a fuel, hydrogen releases nearly three times
as much energy as the same weight of gasoline and nearly seven times than the same weight of coal.55
Green hydrogen has a number of advantages and is gaining momentum. It can be stored for long periods
and unlike solar or wind can be provided more easily and flexibly to meet consumer demand. Nonetheless,
the market is still incipient, and represents only four per cent of global hydrogen production.56
Green hydrogen can be used for vehicle fuel, petroleum refining, metal processing, fertilizer production,
and food processing. Hydrogen also represents the ‘missing piece’ in the energy transition because it
can be employed in hard-to-abate sectors such as cement and steel that cannot use electricity from
intermittent supplies from solar or wind. Moreover, green hydrogen can be converted to feedstock and
to chemicals such as ammonia and methanol, which are easier to store and transport than regular
electricity (Figure II-11).57

Moving fast with frontier technologies

Nevertheless, green hydrogen faces a number of barriers, notably cost and the immaturity of the
technologies, many of which are not ready for widescale commercialization, as for example with gas
turbines. There is also significant energy loss along the production chain, making the process more
energy intensive. There are fears regarding the availability of renewable energy to meet the needs
of increasing green hydrogen production as this sector’s demand for renewable energy could reach
21,000 MW by 2050, which is almost as much electricity as is produced globally today. There are also
uncertainties about regulation and infrastructure.58 Most of these barriers are not structural, and could
in principle be mitigated by innovation, which might, for instance, improve the energy efficiency of
green hydrogen. At the same time, increasing prices for fossil fuels could make green hydrogen more
competitive for certain uses. Furthermore, much of the world’s existing natural gas infrastructure can
be converted for use with hydrogen,59 and there are efforts to establish regulations and standards
(Box II-2).60 Carbon pricing will also have an effect.
Developing economies could become net exporters of green hydrogen. Europe is expected to be
unable to satisfy its own demand as it will exceed the ceiling of its renewable energy production capacity
and may thus become a net importer, mainly from Africa and the Middle East which have the highest
technical potential (Table II-3).61 Nonetheless, this potential is no guarantee of successful production,
and countries must foster the necessary framework and infrastructure.

OPENING GREEN WINDOWS
Technological opportunities for a low-carbon world

Box II 2
Green hydrogen standards and regulations
A global certification system is an important step to the commercialization of green hydrogen, signalling compliance
with regulation and production criteria, and allowing consumers to differentiate green hydrogen from grey hydrogen
(produced with fossil fuels) and blue hydrogen (produced with natural gas). This opens the possibility of companies
acquiring this hydrogen and willing to pay a premium for clean sources. There are several green hydrogen standards
already in place:62
•

TÜV Süd – Has a green hydrogen standard for the transport and the industrial sectors (CMS 70), basing it on
European legislation.

•

ISCC PLUS – ICC is a multistakeholder initiative recognized by the EU, which offers voluntary certification, ISCC
PLUS, for bio-based and recycled raw materials for all markets and sectors not regulated as transportation
fuels under the European Renewable Energy Directive or Fuel Quality Directive.

•

Zero Carbon Certification Scheme – Launched in 2020 for hydrogen and its derivatives by the Smart Energy
Council, an Australian NGO.

However, the criteria in these standards vary substantially, which creates difficulties in harmonising them to constitute
a global certification system.63
Governments have also been enacting regulations and strategies and plans. Examples include:
•

Renewable Energy Directive II – Launched in 2022 by the EU, this considers renewable fuels of non-biological
origin as those produced based on renewable energy (wind, solar, geothermal, ambient energy tide, wave or
other ocean energy, hydropower, biomass, landfill gas, sewage treatment plant gas, and biogas) as electricity
sources for production. It adds that the renewable energy source has to come in operation after or at the
same time as the unit generating the fuel and is either not connected to the grid or connected but providing
evidence that the electricity was supplied without decreasing the electricity in the grid.64

•

Low Carbon Fuel Standard – Launched in 2011 by the state of California, in the United States, this allows
three possible ways to produce renewable hydrogen: (i) through electrolysis using renewable energy, (ii) via
catalytic cracking or steam methane reforming based on biomethane, or (iii) through the thermochemical
conversion of biomass.65

•

Inflation Reduction Act – Implemented in 2022 by the United States, this seeks to stimulate the production
of clean hydrogen through tax credits – increasing the benefits as emissions decrease – and considering
GHG emissions throughout the lifecycle. Clean hydrogen is defined according to emissions thresholds,
with the highest benefit being for production that emits less than 0.45 kg of CO2 per kg of hydrogen.66

2. ELECTRIC VEHICLES
The technology employed in EVs present different benefits. EVs use one or more electric motors for
propulsion. They can be powered by a collector system, with electricity from extra-vehicular sources, or
autonomously from a battery, and will have an electric motor, inverter, boost converter, and an on-board
charger (Figure II-12).

As energy-consuming technologies, EVs create new demands for electricity that can be supplied by
renewables. In addition to the benefits of this shift, such as reducing carbon dioxide emissions and air
pollution, electric mobility also creates significant efficiency gains and could emerge as an important
source of storage for variable sources of renewable electricity. However, the market expansion for this
technology might require infrastructure adaptations to enable sufficient power stations. For example,
in Europe, the current system is considered to be able to cope with the complete replacement of the
car fleet for EVs.67 But this is not necessarily the case in other regions. In terms of diffusion, electric
cars are less common in developing than in developed economies. In 2010, only two developing
economies were among the top ten countries in terms of EV stock.
By 2015, China had managed to reach first position in this ranking, but India had dropped out. India,
Indonesia, and Brazil have demonstrated that while low- and middle-income countries can support
two-wheeler EVs, they may not yet have policies for a full-scale transition to electricity-powered
transportation.68 This is a missed opportunity to generate growth in other sectors. Electric mobility
offers great opportunities to create synergies with other technologies particularly by increasing the
demand for renewable energy. EVs can also provide decentralized storage for variable sources of
renewable electricity through their batteries.

C. READY TO ACT
If developing countries are to capture the economic gains associated with new technologies, their firms
must have the required capabilities to enter new and growing sectors while their governments need
to establish the necessary policies, regulations, and infrastructure to support them. To assess national
preparedness to equitably use, adopt and adapt frontier technologies, this report presents the 2022
readiness index that combines indicators for ICT, skills, R&D, industrial capacity and finance (Table II-4).
The readiness index ranking is dominated by high-income economies, notably the United States, Sweden,
Singapore, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. Emerging economies are primarily found in the second
quarter of the list – notably Brazil is ranked at 40, China at 35, India at 46, the Russian Federation at 31,
and South Africa at 56.

Countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, and Sub-Saharan Africa are the least ready to use, adopt, or
adapt to frontier technologies and are at risk of missing current technological opportunities.
Compared to the initial index in 2021, there are several economies with notable changes in their 2023 rank.
Finland and China, Hong Kong SAR, for example, increased their position significantly due to increases in
their human capital, notably the increase of high-skill employment.
Furthermore, among the emerging economies, Brazil was able to improve its position despite slower
industrial activities, due to increase in ICT development. Meanwhile, China’s lower-than-expected position
in the ranking when compared with its productive and innovative capacity in frontier technologies is due
to urban-rural disparities in Internet coverage and broadband speeds (Box II-3).

OPENING GREEN WINDOWS
Technological opportunities for a low-carbon world

Box II 3
Download speeds in China
China’s position in the 2022 Index can be partially explained by its changing position in the ICT ranking. In the 2022
Index, China had an ICT rank of 117, compared to its ICT rank of 99 in the 2021 Index. This change was largely driven
by China’s mean download speed (Mbps), which was slower relative to its peers according to data collected from
M-Lab. Some reasons for this might include:
•

The wide urban-rural disparities in Internet access, with Internet coverage comparable to Portugal and Poland
in urban areas and similar to Cambodia and Côte d’Ivoire in rural areas.69 There are also stark differences in
broadband penetration and Internet speed across the different provinces in China. According to a 2021 report by
the Chinese organization Broadband Development Alliance, provinces in the West continue to experience much
lower Internet speeds than Eastern provinces. This might drive down average broadband speeds in China.

•

China’s system of Internet firewalls decreases the network performance and download speed of content from
many non-Chinese sites.70 Internet speed is negatively affected as incoming and outgoing traffic is routed
through a limited number of access points which increases latency, while Deep Packet Inspection is used to
monitor the Internet which might cause packet loss.71 As a result, while Internet speeds might be significantly
higher for accessing content hosted on in-country servers, poorer performance might be reported if downloads
were attempted from sites behind firewalls.

•

Internet speeds decreased during lockdowns globally, with China experiencing the highest percentage loss in
speed (52 per cent) of all the countries studied.72 One explanation for this is that lockdowns generate Internet
congestion due to higher online traffic as people increasingly work and study from home.73 If this were the case,
given that lockdowns persisted in China through 2021 while they were lifted in other parts of the world,74 China
might have experienced relatively lower Internet speeds in 2021. However, it should be noted that a variety of
Internet speed rankings exist apart from M-Lab, including Ookla, SpeedTestNet.io, and BandwidthPlace.com.
These rankings adopt different methodologies and assumptions in calculating broadband speed, leading to a
range of estimations of the Internet speed of any given country.

Since 2021, the overall value of the index has increased by 14 per cent, from 0.44 to 0.50 points. For
developed economies the average is 0.80 points; for developing economies 0.50 points; for LDCs, LLDCs,
and SIDS 0.28 points; and for commodity-dependent economies 0.32 points. The gaps between these
groups are wide, but they are starting to narrow.

CHAPTER II
Moving fast with frontier technologies

Having low index scores suggests a lack of the foundational capacity to take full advantage of green
windows. Countries with a lower readiness index will face greater challenges as they seek to revitalize their
transport systems, shifting away from fossil fuels and reducing CO2 emissions in line with Paris Agreement
Nationally Determined Contributions. The EVs market, for instance, shows a strong correlation between
a country’s readiness index and the total value of imports of electric vehicles (Figure II-15). Developed
economies with very high index values have advanced infrastructure and highly skilled populations, as well
as access to the finance to purchase EVs (Figure II-16).
It is important to note that there is no causal relationship between the index and trade activities. In other words,
achieving a higher index does not necessarily lead to an increase in trade activities as measured by import,
or vice versa. Robotics that are commonly used in industry 4.0, for instance, have a positive and significant
correlation between the index value and imports of the goods (see Figure II-15). However, for the last five years,
the imports of this industrial robots have been constantly higher in developing than in the developed economies
(see Figure II-16). It is interesting to note that the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the global distribution which
caused a slowing down of the import of industrial robots in 2020 before picking up again in 2021.

The index highlights areas that need to be improved to enable greater use, adoption, and adaptation of
frontier technologies. Overall, developing countries as a group, and even the top five developing countries,
have lower rankings for ICT connectivity and skills (Figure II-17). LDCs, LLDCs, and SIDS rank lower
than 100 in all the building blocks, with particular deficiencies in ICT infrastructure and in research &
development.

The readiness index highlights areas in which countries need to improve – to place themselves better
in the race to develop new sectors and establish themselves as leaders. However, a high value for the
readiness index does not necessarily mean the country will be able to open the green windows for frontier
technologies, as this also requires appropriate policies and investments.75 The following chapter shows
how this has been working out in practice for green industries in developing countries.

Annex C shows that renewable hydropower
represents an important share of the total installed
capacity. The industry is not included in the present
study for several reasons. There is an ongoing
discussion about how “green” the hydropower
sector really is. The proponents of the hydropower
sector argue that it is a renewable, low carbon
energy technology that is crucial for mitigating
climate change. However, hydropower opponents
argue that large hydropower has large-scale
and irreversible environmental impacts including
ecosystem destruction, geomorphological changes,
hydrological changes, impacts on aquatic species,
habitat, and biodiversity loss. Besides, it is an
industry characterized by large economies of scale

CHAPTER III
Growth powered by renewable energy

This chapter examines developing country experiences in producing, distributing, and using renewable
energy technologies – bioenergy, solar and wind energy, and green hydrogen. The depth and speed
of latecomer development vary according to sector. Mature sectors such as biomass or solar PV have
readily available technologies and can provide a relatively fast track to boosting economic activities.
But new technologies such as green hydrogen, concentrated solar power (CSP), or electric vehicles
are more demanding in terms of developing new technological capabilities and require significant
investment in innovation systems.
In most countries the speed of development is driven by national ambitions to generate economic
growth, mitigate climate change, transform energy production and consumption, electrify rural
communities, or increase energy security. As the same time, there are international and global
pressures to diffuse green investments and establish promising new markets.
Each country needs to identify opportunities in specific stages of the value chain and orient research
and development as well as education and training to build domestic capacity; even the more mature
technologies that are easily imported can be adapted to the local context. Some countries start with
natural advantages such high levels solar radiation, but these do not automatically offer opportunities
for latecomer development. The key to generating growth through the green transition is to foster the
necessary capabilities and respond to opportunities as they arise.1, 2

A. OPENING GREEN WINDOWS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
The presence of Green Windows of Opportunity – favourable but time-bounded conditions for latecomer
development associated with sustainable transformation (Chapter 1) – is specific of each technology and
its characteristics depends on the related institutional, market, or technological changes. The following
sections examine the experiences of some developing countries in producing, distributing, and using
renewable energy technologies: bioenergy, solar and wind energy, green hydrogen, and electric mobility.
Additional cases, in bioenergy, concentrated solar power, wind energy, and electric vehicles are presented
in Annex C.

1. SOLAR PV
China
China has 254 GW of installed capacity in solar PV.3 It has established this world-leading position by
supporting a domestic production and innovation system that combines public and private business
actors as well as by supporting and regulating research institutions (Box III-1). The 2006 Renewable
Energy Law encouraged Chinese firms and research institutes to collaborate with foreign partners
which enabled them to enter international markets. A key programme was the Thousand Talents Plan
aimed at recruiting global experts and attracting the return of prominent Chinese researchers in PV cell
technologies.4, 5
Local firms, universities, and industry associations6 engaged in a progressive catch-up across the whole
PV industry, starting from portable lightning devices, then moving to solar PV panels and ultimately
creating a domestic cell and wafer industry with the technological capabilities to produce polysilicon,
previously imported from the United States. China also started producing power devices such as
inverters.7
Overseas sales suffered a setback with the 2008 financial crisis. Germany and several other
countries reduced their PV subsidy programmes, which caused a considerable drop in demand and,
consequently, prices. In reaction, the Chinese Government boosted domestic demand, through for
example, the Concession Programme for Large-Scale Solar PV Power Plants, the Solar Rooftop Subsidy
Programme, and the Golden Sun Demonstration Programme, offering subsidies of up to 70 per cent of
total investment.8 In this period the sector also benefited from intense interactions among leading firms.

Technological opportunities for a low-carbon world

Box III 1
How China came to dominate the global PV market
The 2008 financial crisis was a blow to China’s overseas PV exports. After that, the State sought to transform local
demand and supply of its PV sector. Supported by national policies, the PV industry promoted cooperation across
the value chain and intensified technological innovation. In 2013, two leading enterprises agreed to procure each
other’s products. Yingli agreed to purchase silicon materials and wafers from GCL-Poly Energy while GCL-Poly Energy
procured components and modules from Yingli to construct solar PV stations.
Later, five state-owned enterprises collaborated on attracting investment, project management, integrated construction,
R&D, training, hardware maintenance, and setting the standards. With the support of the Central Bank, the industry
partnership gained collective advantages globally along the whole value chain.
In the Talatan area of Gonghe county in northwestern China, thanks to the Concession Program for Large Scale Solar
PV Power Plants, herds of sheep scamper through the blue ‘forest’ of solar PV panels and graze in the pasture below.
The solar panels not only collect sunshine they bring water to the soil underneath from monthly washing, producing
quality forage for livestock farming.
Meanwhile Qiejuntai, a villager in Gonghe county, now makes a living from both the solar industry and husbandry,
obtaining an income of over 10,000 euros each year.9 According to China Global Television Network, as of the end of
2020, 100,000 villages across China had installed PV power stations, generating 18.65 million KW of electricity and
bringing an annual income of about 27,000 euros to each village.10

Mexico
To build local demand for solar PV, the Government carried out a national auction, through which successful
bidders were awarded contracts, or power-purchasing agreements that guaranteed the price per unit of
electricity generated.11, 12 In the Mexican approach, these clean energy auctions are technology-neutral,
meaning that all clean energy sources compete. The competition is based on offered price and is driven
by free-market cost competition, with no explicit aim of developing a domestic renewable energy industry.
This auction design attracted large foreign developers and specialized vertically integrated renewable
energy companies, but it offered limited scope for developing domestic capabilities across the value chain.

South Africa
South Africa has developed the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program.
As in Mexico, this is market-based with government purchasing renewable energy through a reverse
auction system. In this case, however, the auctions are technology-specific and there are additional
regulatory requirements to foster black economic empowerment, create jobs, include local content, and
have 70 per cent community ownership.
This produced a different outcome.13 The auction attracted a diverse set of international and local
project developers, and the local content requirements engaged national engineering, procurement, and
construction companies. However, technological upgrade was restricted by an initial shortage of semiand skilled workers, combined with local content requirements.14 In addition, the regulations were not well
enforced, and loopholes enabled foreign developers simply to use warehouses in South Africa rather than
set up production plants.

India
Instead of building up a domestic manufacturing capacity, the Indian national programme prioritized
cheaper prices that would maximize installed capacity. It attracted large projects offering low tariffs and
incentivised energy developers to rely on cheaper imports of solar cells and panels. In general, limited
emphasis has been devoted to R&D and building up domestic and production capabilities. When local
content requirements were introduced, there was insufficient domestic capacity to fulfil the supply15.

40

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2023

CHAPTER III
Growth powered by renewable energy

In 2018, under pressure from domestic manufacturers, the Government introduced a safeguard duty
against solar cell imports from China and Malaysia. However, this forced developers to buy more expensive
panels and slowed down the bidding process – while offering few benefits to domestic manufacturers. If
the manufacture of cells and panels is now out of reach, there are still opportunities in the service stages
of the value chain and for manufacturing other components.16

Viet Nam
Viet Nam has rapidly expanded its solar energy installed capacity and is considered more successful
than other ASEAN countries like Malaysia and Indonesia.17 In 2015, the Government launched the
National Strategy on Renewable Energy Development and followed this in 2020 by a Party’s Resolution
on the Orientation for National Energy Development. Measures included a feed-in-tariff, temporary tax
exemptions for solar developers, and tariff exemptions for imported equipment. Viet Nam also has a
favourable environment for foreign direct investment, and no local content requirements. These measures
attracted foreign developers and created a large domestic market. In 2020, Viet Nam was the world’s
eighth largest market in terms of installed capacity. However, this did not build domestic production or
technological capacity (Box III-2).

Box III 2
The Mekong ‘power delta’ with the sun
Countries in the Mekong Delta have relied in the past for electricity on hydropower. However, output has been affected
by lower rainfall and less runoff,18 as well as unsustainable upstream dam construction and farming patterns. Solar
power is a promising alternative that takes advantage of the natural conditions. Solar power stations are being built in
barren land, on farmlands, or on the river in Viet Nam, Thailand, and Cambodia.
Viet Nam – In southwestern Viet Nam, at the foot of Cam Mountain, in 275 hectares of barren land the domestic private
sector has invested heavily in solar electricity and is expected to produce 400 million kWh. Together with eco-tourism,
the solar business drives the local economy by creating jobs.19 Because the existing publicly managed grid network
has been unable to keep pace, the local provincial government has invested in a 500kV transmission line connecting
An Giang with O Mon in Can Tho, the largest city along the Mekong Delta, in the 2021-2025 period.20
On farmlands in north-western Viet Nam in Sơn La Province, for example, a 100-square-metre solar-powered
dry-house processes 1.5 tons of fresh bamboo shoots every three days and produces 120-150kg of dried product.21
The availability of rooftop solar power avoids the need to burn firewood and thus enables farmers to receive higher
incomes with less time, energy, forest degradation, and air pollution.
Viet Nam also has South-East Asia’s first floating solar power generating system. Floating solar power projects
(i.e., solar panels installed on the surface of reservoirs, industrial ponds, lakes or near-coastal areas), can reuse reservoirs built originally for hydro power and existing transmission infrastructure, increasing supply with almost
no marginal costs.22 The Da Mi project is operated by a national power company, Vietnam Electricity, using a
feed-in-tariff of $9.35 per kilowatt-hour.
Cambodia –After failures in a few solar power projects,23 the Government is nevertheless determined to exploit the
solar potential.24 It has recently approved a 60 MW solar farm in Kampong Chhnang Province, the first part of a
100-MW National Solar Park, as well as a 60-MW farm in Pursat.25
Thailand – In 2021, At Sirindhorn Dam in Ubon Ratchathani province, Thailand, the world’s largest hydro floating solar
farm went online in November 2021.26

Kenya
In Sub-Saharan Africa, there is a rapidly growing solar PV market. More recently, the initiative has been
taken by private companies facilitated by international finance. Domestic solar PV firms have been able
to face up to international competition and have established themselves in different market segments,
having moved from standalone installations to larger-scale plants; from distribution to installation; and from

government tenders and donor projects to commercial contracts.27 This could make Kenya a global hub
for clean energy companies, particularly in small-scale decentralized energy generation and consumption.
In some cases, upgrading has been the result of strategic networking with international actors and of
investments in national capacities and skills.
Nevertheless, domestic companies continue to face significant challenges in the areas of finance, skills
and policy, which prevent them gaining larger shares of the growing domestic market. To develop a wellfunctioning and coordinated domestic solar PV industry, they will need closer collaboration between the
industry players and supporting institutions, such as the commercial banks, the training and academic
institutions, the ministries and various public bodies.28

Ethiopia
The country has enormous potential in solar energy which could be used to privatize and decentralize the
electric power sector through off-grid and mini-grid technologies.

Iran
Thanks to government commitment, solar PV is taking an increasing share of renewable energy
production, but local industrial capacity remains very limited. Some factories are assembling the modules
using imported raw materials – though there are plans to exploit the country’s silica resources. At present
the country does not have clear and implemented regulations and incentives to attract investment and
encourage R&D.29

2. BIOFUELS
A wide range of biomaterials can be combusted to produce heat, converted to electricity, or processed
into biofuels – ranging from agricultural and forestry residues, solid and liquid organic wastes – including
municipal solid waste, sewage, and animal manure. Some crops can also be cultivated specially for
energy, such as corn and soybeans (Figure III-1).
Liquid biofuels are convenient renewable substitutes for internal combustion engines running on gasoline,
diesel or kerosene for use in road, sea and air transport. Apart from direct combustion, adequate energy
utilization of biomaterials is also possible through high-temperature and pressure gasification, hydrothermal
liquefaction converting biomass into crude-like oil, biochemical digestion, fermentation, and extraction
(Figure III-1).
Bioethanol and biodiesel have opened opportunities within climate change strategies in a range of
developing countries. This switch is particularly significant in countries with the potential for sugarcane
production and other crops that do not compete directly with food production.30
While Brazil and other countries, such as Australia, developed biofuel industries based on sugar
cane, many developing countries during the 2010s experimented with oil from palm or from the
seed of the jatropha tree which can produce biodiesel or jet fuel. Jatropha has several favourable
properties such as high yield and low water and fertilizer requirements, as well as high resistance
to pests and the ability to thrive on marginal land without competing with food crops. After the turn
of the millennium, many investors, governments, and NGOs highlighted jatropha as a promising
opportunity.
According to multiple authors,31 jatropha strategies have largely feel short from expected results.
Countries like Mexico, India, China, Ethiopia, Mozambique, the United Republic of Tanzania, and
Ghana did not meet their expectations regarding investments in this crop to use it as biofuel input
to reap economic benefits consequent social gains like reduced poverty.32 Governments and private
investors adopted a “wait-and-see” stance, expecting that technological and land-use problems
could be resolved but there were unexpected complexities, and most investment projects fell far
short of initial prospects.33

Brazil
Brazil’s success with bioethanol largely stems from government policy.34 Experimentation with bioethanol
started in the 1930s, but the current programme was largely a response to the oil crisis of the 1970s when
OPEC placed an embargo on petroleum. The government has taken institutional efforts to increase the
attractivity of the industry and develop the sector. Such efforts include for example the Sugarcane-based
ethanol fuel program and the RenovaBio - Green Certificates for the production.
Brazil gradually developed its production system and knowledge base. The government also incentivised
investments through programmes like BNDES’ Climate Fund. As such, the country developed what
became the most successful biofuel industry in the world so far. Since 1980, Brazil has reduced the far,
cost of producing bioethanol by 88 per cent.35 For comparison the United States has a long history of
bioethanol production based on corn. But over the same period has reduced the cost by 60 per cent.
Today, Brazil is the world leader both in terms of technology and usage of ethanol. Moreover, there
is significant, yet unrealised, export potential36 and Brazil has become the leading supplier of biofuels
technology for the developed world.37 There are also potential forward linkages. Brazil has for example,
invented a flex-fuel engine for cars, enabling alternation between traditional and bioethanol-based fuels.38
Through its wide-ranging biofuel policy frameworks, Brazil has successfully stimulated both demand
and supply,39 and promoted learning by building productive and technological capacities of the private
sector, research and development institutions and other related stakeholders.40 Technologically it is now
a leader in first-generation liquid biofuels and is pioneering new technology – drawing on first-generation
capabilities to compete in the second-generation arena.
Today Brazil has around 30 per cent of the global market for ethanol. It has the largest fleet of flexible-fuel
vehicles and fully supplies local gas stations where unblended fuel ethanol competes directly with gasoline.
In addition, the country exports to a number of countries including the United States, the Republic of
Korea, and the Netherlands.
In future, however, without a change in its innovation system Brazil may be unable upgrade to secondgeneration bioethanol based on food waste and crop residues which do not compete with food production.41
The focus is still largely on sugarcane and Brazil’s federal institutions are less committed to future technologies.
At the federal level this is linked with the discovery of offshore petroleum reserves. If it does not respond to
global technology changes, Brazil may thus experience a ‘technological discontinuity trap’.42

OPENING GREEN WINDOWS
Technological opportunities for a low-carbon world

Ghana
Ghana has focused on producing biofuels using jatropha. In 2006, to increase domestic demand the
Strategic National Energy Plan and National Biofuel Strategy in 2006 enforced blends of gasoline and
biodiesel at 5 per cent by 2010, and 10 per cent by 2015.43 The National Jatropha Plantation Initiative has
established 53 districts across the country to start pilot plantations on low-fertility agricultural land where
they would not compete with food production.44 The projects were strongly supported by NGOs and local
‘jatropha champions.’ Supported by GTZ, UNIDO, and UNDP, key firms and individuals made efforts to
show-case jatropha biodiesel. Production also offered carbon credits through the clean development
mechanism.45
However, the results fell far short of expectations. This was due to low yields and difficulties in ramping
up production. Public R&D support was weak, with relatively little sharing of learning and a lack of the
technical and managerial information needed to enter international markets.46

Ethiopia
The increasing number of sugar factories and the vast land suitable for growing feedstocks offer considerable
potential for biofuels which could serve as alternative fuels for transport and cooking services. The country
has been producing bioethanol from biomass for decades, but it supplies less than one per cent of
power through this source.47 Taking advantage of its potential for biofuel production would allow Ethiopia
to decrease its dependence on fuel imports, and the country could explore difference sources such as
sugarcane and jatropha. Nonetheless, there is a need to reform policies to provide greater support.48

The United Republic of Tanzania
Tanzania’s sectoral system of innovation is unresolved.49 By 2005 the system comprised a few loosely
connected ‘experiments’ involving around 30 different actors in a grassroots-based organizational model.
The system then evolved to a profit-driven model through which thousands of smallholder out-growers
supplied jatropha seeds to a firm owning a centralized oil-processing facility.50 In addition, transnational
corporations established large plantations to export jatropha seeds to the West for processing. As in
Ghana, initiatives were linked to foreign commercial investors or aid donors.51

India
India had an ambitious jatropha biodiesel development programme but many policy changes were not
implemented, and production fell short of capacity. Public institutes did not carry out sufficient research on
increasing yields, resulting in short-duration crops. A better approach would be to shift from jatropha to an
approach using multiple types of feedstocks or inputs instead of jatropha alone, with a better system of
incentives both at the feedstock and biodiesel production stages, and augmenting the efforts in research
and development for increasing the yield from the feedstock. 52

3. GREEN HYDROGEN
Hydrogen for energy can be produced in a number of ways, typically classified as black, brown, grey or
green depending on the source of energy employed in its production. Black hydrogen uses coal or lignite
as a source of energy, while grey hydrogen is created from natural gas, or methane, using steam methane
reformation.53 Green hydrogen, on the other hand, is made by electrolyzing water using electricity from
renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind power (see Chapter 2 for a discussion of the status of
green hydrogen).
Green hydrogen can reduce dependence on oil price volatility and supply disruptions, as well as lowering
energy costs.54 Since 2019, a number of European states have developed hydrogen strategies, including
Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the United Kingdome and
Spain, as well as in Australia and Canada.

44

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2023

CHAPTER III
Growth powered by renewable energy

However, the most attractive sites for producing green hydrogen are in countries with abundant solar and
wind resources – particularly in Africa, Southern Asia and the Western regions of South America.55 There
have been a number of initiatives in Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, Viet Nam, Türkiye, Morocco, Namibia and
South Africa.56 Most have relatively small domestic markets, but since green hydrogen can be transported
over long distances by boat these countries can become significant exporters. For this, however they will
need to improve their techno-institutional capacity and invest in electrolysers and infrastructure for storage
and transportation.

Chile
Chile has ambitious climate targets with the expectation that, by 2030, 70 per cent of the power grid will
use energy from renewable sources – capitalizing on solar in the north of Chile and wind in the south.
In 2020 the Government published a three-phase Green Hydrogen Strategy. The first phase, starting
from 2025, will mainly target the domestic market, replacing grey hydrogen for heavy and long-distance
transportation. The second stage from 2030 extends local use along with exports. The third, long-term
stage after 2035 anticipates opening new markets both domestic well and international.57 However, Chile
is a long way from markets in Asia and Europe. To overcome shipping costs exporters will need to
produce hydrogen at a low-cost.58
Most of the impetus and coordination has come from the State which has helped lower barriers and
reduced regulatory, financial, and technical risks. Private actors, academia and business associations can
collaborate with the Government to invest in capabilities, technologies, businesses, and projects for both
domestic and export markets. The plan includes:
• Funds – For supporting companies, and national and international consortiums to invest in scalable
and replicable green projects.
• Pricing – A roadmap for pricing of fossil fuel emissions to level the playing field.
• Regulations and standards – To be clear and stable throughout the value chain to ensure safety and
give certainty to investors.
• Community participation – Early and transparent involvement of local communities in green
hydrogen-related projects.
• Innovation system – An R&D system involving industry, academia and technological centres.
Since 2017, Chile has had micro-grids powered by green hydrogen, providing 24-hour clean energy
without requiring diesel-based power backup systems. Developed by the Italian company, Enel, these
systems can be on-grid or off-grid and moved to locations such as small community camps.59 The
Chilean National Development Agency (CORFO) has six new pilot projects selected with the involvement
of international investors.

Brazil
In 2021, the Ministry of Mining and Energy presented a baseline Hydrogen Strategy, which called for
national stakeholders to “embrace the opportunities for the development of various technologies for the
production and use of hydrogen, including green hydrogen, in which it can be very competitive.”60 Several
states have initiatives to kickstart production – taking advantage of their renewable energy capacity and
port infrastructure. The state of Ceará for example, is developing a green hydrogen hub at the port of
Pecém which connects solar and wind energy parks and an export processing zone. Pecém port is a
joint venture between the State of Ceará and the Port of Rotterdam Authority – a link that could facilitate
entry to European markets.61 By October 2022, the State Government had signed 22 memoranda of
understanding with companies from several countries: two of these, from Australia and United States,
have moved to the pre-contract phase. Other initiatives are in the states of Bahia and Pernambuco.

Technological opportunities for a low-carbon world

China
China is the world’s largest producer of hydrogen, but most of this is from coal. For green hydrogen,
China lags behind advanced countries in key technologies for storage and transport, though these can be
expected to emerge in the future.62 China’s policies for developing hydrogen date back to the 10th Five
Year Plan (2001-2005).
In 2021, China launched a mega-project in Inner Mongolia to build a cluster of plants that will use solar
and wind energy to produce 66,900 tons of green hydrogen a year.63 A further project is the Renewable
Hydrogen 100 Initiative, launched by the China Hydrogen Alliance which includes China Energy Corporation
and several companies from the energy, transportation and metallurgical industries, along with universities
and research centres. The aim is to install electrolysers to produce100 GW of hydrogen by 2030.64
China is also at the centre of the UNIDO Global Programme for Green Energy in Industry, through the
International Hydrogen Energy Centre in Beijing which will operate as a knowledge partner by supporting
research and development.65

South Africa
In September 2021, South Africa approved a Hydrogen Society Roadmap aiming to achieve competitive
domestic production by 2030 (Box III-3). Three green hydrogen hubs have been identified in South Africa’s
‘hydrogen valley’.66 The Johannesburg hub will primarily produce for industry. The Durban hub will produce
for vehicles, as well as for port activities and oil refining. The Limpopo hub will produce for the mining
sector. South Africa’s Department of Science and Innovation points out that the country needs to identify
the potential for green hydrogen in different sectors, scale up the number of electrolyzers and invest in the
necessary transportation and storage systems.67

Box III 3
Green hydrogen is a game-changer in South Africa
Since 2007, people in South Africa have become accustomed to blackouts due to load shedding,68 when the electricity
demand exceeds the available supply.69 In 2020, according to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research of
South Africa, the country spent 859 hours load shedding. During the decade from 2009 to 2019, the total economic
cost of load shedding was estimated at ZAR338 billion (around 20 billion euros).70 Demand for electricity has continued
to outgrow supply. The state-owned Eskom is also heavily reliant on coal-power plants.
Green hydrogen could be a game-changer. The national Government is seeking a just transition by intensifying publicprivate cooperation through its Hydrogen Society Roadmap. The initial project, CoalCO2-X, is in the eastern province
of Mpumalanga, where flue gas in coal-fired power stations is stripped of pollutants and mixed with green ammonia
to be converted into fertilizer.
To embark on the project, the Department of Science and Innovation of the national Government granted ZAR50 million
(around €3 million).71 In June 2021, the private-equity-owned energy producer Sasol and the state-owned financier
Industrial Development Corporation, secured joint funding for the feasibility study.72 More private- and public-sector
investment is expected to follow.
In the local private sector, Mitochondria Energy Systems is developing bespoke fuel-cell technology in cooperation
with the Austrian engineering consortium AVL, Co-funded by two state-owned financial institutions, the Industrial
Development Corporation of South Africa and the Development Bank of Southern Africa Fuel cell systems could be a
source of cleaner energy in industry and for combined heat and power.73

Namibia
Namibia could produce low-cost renewable energy on a large scale and, given the limited national demand,
most of this can be exported.74 The Harambee Prosperity Plan Green identifies green hydrogen as a
transformative strategic industry.75 The Government has launched the Southern Corridor Development

46

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2023

CHAPTER III
Growth powered by renewable energy

Initiative and established a Green Hydrogen Council supported by a Technical Committee to collect and
coordinate projects and infrastructures. These will include plans for both green hydrogen and ammonia,
with wind, solar electrolysis and desalination assets, a wind blade manufacturing plant and adequate port
facilities.
The Namibia Green Hydrogen Association provides a platform for public-private interactions. In January
2022 the President announced that the first bid to produce 300,000 tons of green hydrogen and ammonia
per year had been won by Hyphen Hydrogen Energy.76
Namibia has established international cooperations to support hydrogen production. It established
a partnership with Germany to identify suitable sites for green hydrogen production. This is part of
the H2Atlas-Africa project, which will carry out research on green hydrogen production in arid areas
using desalinated water. 77 To build domestic knowledge this also includes exchange programmes for
researchers and experts, and scholarships for Namibian students. The country also signed agreements
with Belgium and Rotterdam (Netherlands). These international agreements encompass funding, but
Namibia is also considering options like green or sustainable bonds to achieve the necessary value for
the projects.78

Morocco
The Middle East and North Africa region has an abundance of solar and wind power and has considerable
potential for supplying green hydrogen demand to countries in the European Union – transporting it
through existing gas pipelines.79 In Morocco, the German Moroccan Energy Partnership will include
technical support for the elaboration of a roadmap for local production and for exports to Europe and
elsewhere.80

Oman
Oman has the advantages of consistent daytime sunlight and strong winds at night, so is starting to invest
in green hydrogen. One of the world’s largest plants is being planned by a consortium which includes the
state-owned oil and gas company OQ, the Hong Kong SAR China-based renewable hydrogen developer
InterContinental Energy, and the Kuwait-based energy investor Enertech. Most of the output will be
exported as hydrogen or as ammonia, which is easier to store and ship, to Europe.81

Africa
The Africa Hydrogen Partnership Trade Association (AHP) is a non-profit company incorporated in
Mauritius, which enables member companies to exchange knowledge on economic, technical, and
other relevant social topics, including the treatment of political, legal and tax issues, as well as to lobby
with governments and administrative bodies with one voice.82 One of the AHP projects is the issuing of
Green African Hydrogen Bonds to collect low-cost, long-term financial capital, creating mutually beneficial
opportunities for African governments and financial institutions.83

B. GREEN WINDOWS OF OPPORTUNITY
This section considers the extent to which countries are in a position to take advantage of green
windows of opportunity and how they have responded. Some countries may have the conditions
to develop such technologies but unless they respond strategically to seize these opportunities,
they may be firmly locked into fossil-fuel pathways, leaving foreign investors to capture the arising
markets. Other countries may wish to take these opportunities but lack the necessary conditions,
especially in terms of industrial capacity and sectoral system capabilities that are relevant to a given
green technology.
Table III-1 considers four scenarios in terms of preconditions and responses – though is this necessarily
a simplification. There are many grey areas and overlaps between weak and strong conditions.

1. SCENARIO 1 – WINDOWS OPEN
China – The best scenario for seizing these economic opportunities is where strong preconditions are
combined with strong responses. This is evidently the case for China which has large internal markets
for green technologies and a diverse industrial structure. It also has design and engineering capabilities
for biomass plant construction84 and scientific knowledge in solar PV as well as R&D in nascent
technologies such as CSP.85, 86 Regarding responses, there have been efforts in several sectors to codesign environmental and industrial policies. Many initiatives have been put in place to diffuse knowledge
among firms and knowledge institutions such as government stimulation of knowledge spillovers, with
loose enforcement of property rights and diffusion through state-owned design institutes.
Brazil – Over many years, Brazil has built the preconditions to take up opportunities in green sectors.
It has extensive sugar and ethanol processing plants and the technological learning linked to these
sectors. Technology suppliers and research institutions have cooperated in sugarcane-related technology
development. Private firms also responded to these opportunities by establishing collaborative consortia
to develop cars with flex-fuel systems (i.e., engines that run on a combination of gasoline and methanol
or ethanol).87 Although driven initially by the local market, Brazil has been moving to a leadership position
in the global market.88
Chile – Another case that can combine of adequate preconditions with strong responses is the development
of the green hydrogen industry in Chile. The country has a relatively well-developed production system,
and a tradition of public investments in sustainable industrial development.

2. SCENARIO 2 – WINDOWS TO BE OPEN
A combination of strong preconditions with insufficient responses translates into possible opportunities
that have not be taken up yet. This is the scenario in which many developing economies find themselves:
India – The National Solar Mission prioritized low-cost deployment above stimulating local manufacturing.
This has resulted in a high dependency on imports. Insufficient attention was paid to training, promotion
of linkages to relevant stages of the value chain and to R&D to boost competitiveness. This illustrates the
importance of carefully designing and complementing domestic market stimulation to avoid insufficient
protection of domestic investments.89
Bangladesh – An existing system of R&D organizations involving biomass energy has not been
complemented with appropriate incentives to encourage biogas plant installations. Also, very little has
been done to increase awareness among farmers about the potential of waste management.90
Morocco – Concentrated solar power has been promoted through strong political commitment towards
solar energy. Thanks to an initial productive base, a few domestic companies have begun displaying some
capabilities.91 Nonetheless, by 2015, the practical opportunities for local manufacturing of solar energy
inputs and components were still restricted because of a limited capacity in promoting technology and
knowledge transfer.92
China – China had the heavy industry capabilities needed to manufacture and install wind turbines and
strong university-industry linkages.93 However, compared with its success in solar PV, China has been
unable to achieve market leadership. Green windows develop over time, and strategies and initiatives
need to adapt to continue to be effective. Those based on building basic production capacity may
be insufficient for subsequently upgrading and deepening technological capabilities, especially when
technologies are evolving. In the Chinese wind sector, there were good preconditions. However, it was
unable to follow the successful pathway of other green sectors, such as solar PV. This would have
required the integration of ‘smart systems’ for turbine and wind farm management which the Chinese
wind industry could not deliver.94

3. SCENARIO 3 – WINDOWS WITHIN REACH
Some countries have weak preconditions but are nevertheless taking active steps to reach for the windows:
Thailand – For biogas, the Government has offered subsidies, tax incentives, and mandatory purchasing
of electricity generated. This has encouraged private investors and a co-evolutionary pattern with shifts
within and across learning mechanisms.95
Viet Nam – Viet Nam has the opportunity to generate biomass energy from rice husks. Private actors,
including some foreign investors such as Decathlon, and public actors, including domestic research and
development institutions, are developing a dynamic sectoral system.96
Ethiopia – Despite little experience in this area, the wind industry has grown through major projects. The
Government is building key elements to ensure more local learning in and around projects. While still with
several shortcomings, the Ethiopian Government has taken an active role in designing projects to ensure
maximum local learning, by ensuring that professional users are more involved in project execution.97
Namibia – The Namibia Green Hydrogen Association has been created to provide a platform for private
actors and government-business interactions. Namibia has also established a critical partnership with
Germany, characterized by intense R&D interactions and collaborations to identify suitable sites for
producing and training professionals specialized in this new industry.

4. SCENARIO 4 – WINDOWS IN THE DISTANCE
Weak preconditions and responses provide a meagre scenario for seizing green windows as shown in the
examples here.
Kenya – Relatively weak starting points have impeded large-scale wind development. Insufficient
strategies to ensure local embeddedness and to learn from projects resulted in a lack of success to seize
opportunities for learning and supply chain development.98, 99 Projects such as the Lake Turkana Wind
Power Project should be more deeply integrated, with strategies for strengthening sectoral systems of
production and innovation.100 These could include initiatives regarding the training and certification of
engineers and technicians and research programmes in universities.
Mexico – The country has vast potential for bioenergy but has weak regulations and a lack of technical
competencies limits awareness of the potential.101 As a result there has not been sufficient public and
private investment to upgrade bioenergy technology.
Pakistan – The story in the bioenergy industry is similar to that of Mexico, with a lack of capabilities and
effort.102

C. MATURITY AND TRADABILITY OF GREEN TECHNOLOGIES
As in Table III-6, Green technologies can be analysed in terms of their maturity and tradability.
The distinction between mature versus immature technologies is explained by the existence and
development of different socio-technical configurations, including infrastructure, regulations, market and
technical standards, maintenance networks and user practices. The development of low-maturity (or
immature) technologies requires significant policymaking efforts, including large R&D investments, market
creation support, and technical standards.103
Tradability varies with the energy source. Electricity is difficult to trade over very long distances, whereas
liquid fuels such as bioethanol or green hydrogen in the form of ammonia are easier to transport. More
importantly, the underlying energy production technology also has variable tradability. At one end of the
spectrum, hydropower technology needs to be almost fully produced at the point of energy generation
and consumption. At the other end of the spectrum, electric vehicles are highly tradeable and can be
produced far from the point of consumption.

1. TECHNOLOGICAL MATURITY
Mature technologies are fully developed with stable, dominant designs – along with the infrastructure,
regulations, market and technical standards, maintenance networks and user practices.104 The automobile
sector, for example, has high maturity for one dominant design of petrol and diesel cars, and is now
arriving at medium maturity for the design of electric or hydrogen vehicles. Wind also has medium maturity
– for onshore wind turbines and second-generation offshore turbines.
There is not, however, a unique and straightforward way of measuring technological maturity. One way is
through considering the year the patent was applied for, and also the dates of other patents that it cites –
which is here is termed the average ‘citation date’. 105 Mature technologies are likely to have patents dating
back many years. Thus, the gap between these applications can be taken as a measure of maturity in
years. For example, a patent for a new technology in 2016 might cite patents from 2014, 2010, and 2006.
The average year of citation would be (2014+2010+2006)/3= 2010. The maturity of the patent would be
2016 minus 2010, and thus six years.106
This report has calculated the average year of patent for each major technology, and for the top-20 most
cited patents the average citation date. For AI, for example, on average, most patents were applied for in
2014 and cite patents on average from 2005, producing a difference of 8.72 years. The same calculations
have been carried out for 15 frontier technologies (Figure III-2).
By this measurement, AI is a mature technology as, on average, most patents were applied for in 2014 but
cited patents from 2005 (and thus a difference of 8.72 years between average applications and forward
citations). This may seem counter intuitive. But today’s AI patents, such as those for autonomous vehicles
and the metaverse, are technologically close to those for search engines and digital maps, and many of
the underlying principles patented in 2005 are still valid.107
IoT, on the other hand is relatively immature, with an average patent application year of 2017 and an
average citation date of 2016. This suggests that the dominant design behind IoT innovation is being
updated every 1.4 years, reflecting a technology that is still evolving fast.
However, this methodology does create anomalies. Not all technologies are as mature as suggested by
this measure. For green hydrogen, for example, progress over this period has been slowed by a lack of
research in the past. Nonetheless, its pace is now picking up. Between 2020 and 2021 the number of
applications jumped from 6 to 31.
Developing countries should take into consideration the level of maturity when deciding which frontier
technologies to switch to. Immature sectors offer open opportunities that latecomers can use to disrupt
the industry. However, these sectors are also more difficult to operate in since they require greater initial
efforts in science and R&D that are only within the capacity of strong domestic systems, such as China
for CSP and in Brazil for bioethanol. Mature technologies may demand less R&D, but they also present

potential barriers in terms of strong and efficient production processes and tradability that may deter new
competitors.108 Moreover, in such a setting, countries must be able to acquire technologies and adapt
them to local circumstances.
Biomass and solar PV have mature technologies that latecomers can absorb and use with machinery
from the outside. For example, in the case of solar PV, China was able to take advantage of the green
window as it could import foreign production machinery and benefit from economies of scale. It required
entrepreneurial dynamism in the private sector and state support on the supply side. In India, on the
other hand, with weaker manufacturing capability, the sector did not develop as expected because of the
inability to manage localization issues.

2. TRADABILITY
Like technological maturity, tradability is not easy to assess in a rapid appraisal. This is because tradability
relates to at least three aspects of innovation – of capital equipment; of the technology itself and the
processes needed to use it; and of energy being produced. An indication of the extent of the tradability of
green technologies is indicated in Table III-7.
Tradability influences competitive dynamics as well as modes of learning. Sectors with high tradability
may need a degree of market protection, and careful design and implementation strategies to boost
demand.109 Taking advantage of high tradability in capital equipment, however, requires strong capacities
in related production domains. In the case of low tradability, learning may initially occur through FDI.

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2023

OPENING GREEN WINDOWS
Technological opportunities for a low-carbon world

For example, for wind, where turbines can be traded, although at high transportation costs, Kenya was
able to use FDI to import turbine technology. However, combined with the relatively small market size,
the lack of preconditions in the private sector – in particular the capacity in heavy-industry and electrical
engineering – have meant that the opportunity is still distant. In China, such preconditions were in place and
enabled the catching up for required domestic deployment. Through dynamic localization, FDI was replaced
or took on a new role over time. Low tradability offers a degree of natural protection in the home market. For
technologies with low tradability and low maturity, countries can take advantage if they have the necessary
R&D capabilities and the capacity to supply components. For CSP, China was able to open the window,
while Morocco with a relatively weak supply base and limited R&D capability missed this opportunity.

D. REQUIREMENTS FOR OPENING GREEN WINDOWS
Opening green windows in developing countries requires government activities at different levels – national
and local – and the involvement of various public and private stakeholders. Overall policies to open and
take advantage of these windows should be mission-oriented – going beyond levelling the playing field to
fixing market failures and involving broader programmes of market co-creation and shaping (Box III-4).110
While the opportunities differ from one technology to another, benefitting from them involves two main
stages.111 The first to identify and open windows of opportunity. The second is to assess what is needed
and to sustain the processes. However, the stages will often overlap. Some assessment must be done
before the decision to invest otherwise the window may be missed. There are also likely to be feedback
loops requiring regular adjustments.

54

Box III 4
Mission-oriented policymaking
Mission-oriented policies require foresight to identify future opportunities, recognize the conditions needed to take
advantage of these opportunities, and how to overcome possible weaknesses and challenges in the national systems
of innovation. This diagnosis should be the basis for new strategies, establishing organizations and institutions, and
facilitating linkages in the innovation system. Mission-oriented policy making for a greener economy should:
a) Be well defined with clear intermediate goals and deliverables as well as embedded processes of monitoring
and accountability.
b) Include R&D projects to account for possible failures which should be accepted as learning experiences.
c) Ensure investment across different sectors and involving different private and public actors.
d) Engage a wide range of public institutions, with a clear division of labour and well-defined responsibilities for
coordinating and monitoring.

1. IDENTIFY AND SWITCH
This can be a complex task since policymakers often have to make decisions over long time periods
based on incomplete information and in the face of emerging developments. They need to identify the
potential of particular windows in terms of the availability of natural resources, such as favourable wind
conditions or the availability of agricultural waste, and also the national capacity to use or build the
necessary technology.

Align environmental and energy, STI and industrial policies
For this purpose, policies that would previously have been developed in separate domains need to be
co-created across the energy-environmental and industrial spheres. For example, initiatives to facilitate
a green energy system, such as auctions or feed-in tariffs, should be aligned with industrial policy and
measures to build local capacity for production and innovation.112 This, however, is not always an easy
endeavour, so it might require active effort to avoid conflicts (Box III-5).
In Thailand, for example, the Ministry of Energy developed environmental legislation but also encouraged
factories to invest in biogas production and combined this with policies to strengthen the sectoral innovation
system. At the same time, a network of other actors such as the Ministry of Science and Technology, was
researching and developing biogas technology and setting up demonstration programmes. Also, the
Board of Investment under the office of the Prime Minister, introduced tax incentives to attract private
investors. Various research centres and universities established training programmes to build domestic
capacity for setting up and maintaining the installed systems.113

OPENING GREEN WINDOWS
Technological opportunities for a low-carbon world

Box III 5
Political economy challenges of renewable energy sectors
The development of green sectors entails political economy challenges. First, managing the incentives created is
key to achieving the desired results. Due to market and coordination failures, governments must deploy incentive
measures to stimulate investments in these sectors. However, adequate state-business relations (SBRs) are required
to establish the necessary information exchange to implement and succeed with such incentive policies. Second,
policies enacted by different governmental bodies influence the industrial development of green sectors – especially,
renewable energy sources. However, different governmental bodies often have different priorities, which might create
tensions between policies. Therefore, ensuring their alignment through intragovernmental coordination is necessary.
Links between the state and the private sector are important channels to improve information flows114 so that the
government manages to get the relevant information and the transfer of publicly produced knowledge.115 However, this
cannot occur in state capture by the private sector. The state bureaucracy must be able to retain its independence to
adapt and withdraw incentive measures if they are not achieving its goals or are no longer necessary.116 In Germany,
for example, the institutionalization pattern of SBRs in the automotive industry created barriers for new firms and
groups to engage with the State. Consequently, incumbent firms that invested in carbon-intensive vehicle technologies
successfully delayed the introduction of further policies to incentivize EVs in the 2000s. Meanwhile, in the United
States, the mode of SBR in this sector allowed for the participation of different stakeholders, including those with
environmental-friendly agendas, which favoured the enactment of regulations incentivizing EVs.117
A second political economy challenge comes from the intersection of different policy domains. Sustainable development
is a cross-cutting issue and relevant policies are spread across a wide range of government organizations. For
example, energy, industrial118, environmental119, trade and competition120 policies influence innovation in the renewable
energy sector, as well as their interaction.121 So, promoting the coordination of different governmental bodies is key to
mitigating the risks of contradicting policies and facilitating the exploration of synergies between them. For example,
policies to improve the competitiveness and capabilities of renewable energy producers and their inputs suppliers
favour the deployment of renewable energies if they have a decreasing effect on prices, while energy policies can
stabilize and expand the domestic market for these sources, reducing the uncertainties and risks that investors face.122
In the opposite case, a lack of alignment between policies undermines their effect. For instance, in Germany, the wind
energy sector faced financial issues created by the lack of coordination between incentive policies and the adaptation
of the infrastructure,123 while in Brazil the development bank attached national content requirements to the offer of
interest rates lower than the market rate for solar energy projects and promoted the construction of domestic industry,
but the trade policy made it cheaper to import the final panels than their separate parts to assemble it in the country.124
Notwithstanding the need for policy alignment, different government organisations often have distinct priorities. In the
renewable energy sector, there might be a trade-off between ensuring faster and cheaper deployment of projects and
developing a national industry since the latter entails additional costs (at least temporarily).125 This trade-off reflects a
contradiction inherent to industrial policies targeting green sectors. One way of measuring its success is to analyse
the amount of clean energy produced; another way focuses on traditional industrial policy measures, like jobs created
and the international competitiveness of supported industries, among others. However, the fastest way of expanding
renewable energy production is to rely on imported goods and suppliers, which conflicts with the creation of domestic
industries.126 Consequently, the priority level given to each of these goals leads to different policy designs and, thus,
different industrial outcomes.127 In South Africa, for example, while the National Treasury prioritises energy deployment
at a low cost, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) emphasises the development of local manufacturing and
job creation. The DTI is responsible for drafting local content requirements, but the National Treasury governs the
Renewable Energy Independent Power Producers’ Procurement Programme (RE IPPPP). This results in some missed
opportunities to push forward the national industry. The fourth round of RE IPPPP did not, for instance, include any
requirement for the local lamination of solar PV modules as a bidding requirement, which could have resulted in job
creation and spin-off activities that benefited local industries.128

Select and adapt to local circumstances
Policy instruments need to be selected according to the intended goal. In sectors characterized by
domestic market opportunities, the selection of policy instruments for market stimulation, for example,
through feed-in tariffs or national auction systems, needs to be carefully designed and implemented.

56

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2023

CHAPTER III
Growth powered by renewable energy

Policies also need to be adapted to local needs. Box III-6 describes two renewable energy support
mechanisms: feed-in-tariffs and auctions, showing their advantages and disadvantages.
The Mexican and South African national auctions for renewable energy show how they can work differently
in diverse contexts. In Mexico, for example, the priority was low-cost deployment, while in South Africa
the objective was to establish a domestic renewable energy value chain. This led to different micro level
policies and produced different outcomes.129

Box III 6
Renewable energy support mechanisms
Feed-in tariffs
These are fixed electricity prices paid to renewable energy (RE) producers for each unit of energy produced and
injected into the electricity grid. The feed-in-tariff (FIT) usually varies between technologies to reflect the differences in
generation costs as well as between the size of installed capacity, reflecting the higher generation costs of small- and
medium-scale RE projects. A third differentiation is according RE resource quality, such as the average wind speed at
different project locations. The FIT for is higher for sites with lower RE potential.
FITs are relatively simple policy instruments that can be fine-tuned to different policy objectives – such as innovation,
climate protection, and regional development. For investors, FITs combined with long-term contracts guaranteed by
the government, provide transparency, predictability and security, and therefore contribute to reducing investment
risks and financing costs.
The main challenge with FITs is to define levels of remuneration that are neither too low to be attractive for investors
nor too high as to result in over-paying. This requires good information on project costs along with effective monitoring.
Auctions and tendering schemes
These are competitive mechanisms for allocating financial support to RE projects, usually based on the cost of
electricity production. Public authorities are responsible for preparing the tender documents, the publication of the
tender, the evaluation of the bids and the selection of the winning bids. They specify the capacity (kW) or the electricity
generation (kWh). They can also specify the technology such as solar PV or wind energy, or they can be technologically
neutral. Sometimes they indicate the location. Project developers can then submit a bid, outlining their proposal and
stating the price per unit of electricity they will be able to realize.
Auctions and tendering schemes stimulate competition between different operators, locations and technologies,
reveal the actual costs of RE technologies, and prevent overcompensation.
Auctions can help control the development of renewable energy projects because they require public authorities to define
the required additions to capacity. This enables central planning and coordination of renewable energy development.
However, for the bidders, there are certain costs and risks – which also tend to discourage the involvement of small
and medium investors and can lead to more expensive offers.
The main difference between FITs and auctions is the mechanism for price discovery. In FITs, the price is fixed by the
policymakers. In auctions, the industry determines the price through competitive bidding. If a country lacks experience
and does not have cost data available, auctions are a useful way of discovering the true cost of the technology.
However, for auctions to be successful, they need to be competitive, which means there needs to be enough interest
amongst project developers.

Combine policy instruments
Policymakers will need to use a combination of measures. In China, for example, creating the domestic
market for solar energy was combined with subsidies for developers of off-grid and grid-connected
projects, covering up to 70 per cent of the costs of installations as part of the Golden Sun Demonstration
Program. There were also public investments in grid infrastructure and in poverty alleviation programs of
installation of solar PV panels for poor households.130 There was also mandatory purchasing of electricity
generated from renewable energy.

OPENING GREEN WINDOWS
Technological opportunities for a low-carbon world

Find the finance
For building up solar PV production the China Development Bank and other state and commercial banks
provided credit to PV producers when most Western solar manufacturers had difficulty accessing credit
due to the financial crisis.131
Other developing countries will be unable to finance renewable energy projects from national sources, but
they should be able to get concessional external finance. Morocco, for example, identified CSP as the
best option, and for CSP installations was supported by the Climate Investment Fund, the World Bank,
the African Development Bank and other EU financing institutions.

Establish demonstration programs
Nascent industries such as CSP and green hydrogen need to be built up through constant experimentation
and steady improvement. For CSP, China, for example, built knowledge and experience within domestic
firms through “megaprojects of science-research”, experimenting with different technical designs on the
ground.132 Similarly, in Chile, with the support of international investors, the National Development Agency
established several green hydrogen pilot projects.

2. ASSESS AND SUSTAIN SECTORAL SYSTEMS
Governments need to assess the current conditions and then strengthen sectoral innovation systems.
Much of this happens within ‘green industrial policy,’ which mainly involves mobilizing the necessary
actors and resources and directing how knowledge capacities are upgraded – often amid considerable
technological, economic, and political uncertainties.

Evaluate existing conditions
Successful exploitation of green windows naturally depends on pre-existing conditions in the sectoral
system. Dynamic conditions will unfold and develop in an emergent trajectory. Both public and private
preconditions are essential. Public preconditions involve both overall state capacity and governance
capability in the relevant areas, such as the strength of relevant public agencies in the regulation field, the
extension support system, and the provision of public-goods services. A lead agency within government
should mobilize resources and convene stakeholders to assess overall state capacity as well as the
strengths of public agencies, particularly for regulation, and extension support systems, and for providing
public services. Without a lead agency it can be hard to ensure experience sharing and interactive learning
between stakeholders. Kenya, for example, found it difficult to take advantage of wind power in the
absence of a national agency to assemble expertise, enable systematic learning and allow for transfer of
knowledge between projects.133
For each technology, tailored strategies should be developed and adjusted along with the necessary
support systems, knowledge infrastructures and design and engineering capabilities – identifying activities
that local firms can feasibly undertake.
In industries where the technology is mature, as with wind and solar, it may be difficult for latecomers
to produce core components. But there can be opportunities further down the value chain related
to deployment, such as project development, engineering, procurement, and construction.134 These
need to be carefully examined because some policy instruments rely on private sector capacity; there
is little point for example in stipulating local content requirements if local companies lack the capacity
to deliver.135
Governments need to assess at various stages where and how production and innovation must be
strengthened and changed.136, 137 To do so, they can take advantage of UNCTAD’s Science, Technology
and Innovation Policy reviews which cover the activities of national and local governments, private

Access external knowledge
Building domestic production typically means learning from other countries. In China, for solar PV for
example, firms were encouraged to carry out research with international partners.138

Invest in domestic R&D
Nascent green technologies are usually biased towards capital and the use of high-skill labour, and
require significant investments in R&D. Governments can offer subsidies to build up research, with the
collaboration of universities and industry both domestic and foreign (Box III-7).
Public R&D investments are also needed in process improvements and complementary technologies.139
And when technologies are rapidly evolving, as in the wind industry, this investment will need to be
continuous. China, for example, did not provide sufficient support for its shift from onshore to offshore
turbine technology.140
In the early stages, when the domestic market cannot support a competitive industry, governments can
set up demonstration projects, as happened with CSP in China and green hydrogen in Chile.

Box III 7
Promoting R&D in green areas
Oman - Innovation Park Muscat is an initiative under the Ministry of Higher Education, Research & Innovation
that encourages scientific research, innovation, and collaboration between various sectors. It provides access to
various facilities and services to create an environment that motivates innovators, entrepreneurs, and companies
to develop ideas in energy, food and biotechnology, health, water, and environment sectors.
Philippines – The Department of Science and Technology (DOST) supports R&D projects in line with green
technology and innovation. Topics covered include Machinery for Decontaminating Rice Hull as Litter Floor
for Broiler Breeder Production; Black Soldier Fly farming for agricultural productivity and waste management;
Development of nano fertilizer from poultry waste biogas digestate; and Extraction of Phytohormones from Waste
Coconut Water using Biochar Derived from Agricultural Residues. The DOST is pushing for the passage of
the Science for Change Bill, which provides programmes for establishing R&D centres and collaborative R&D
between academia and industry. This initiative bolsters the productivity and competitiveness of industry players
and drives R&D on renewable forms of energy and green technologies. Also in the Philippines, the “Niche Centers
in the Regions for R&D” will focus on sectors related to health and industry, energy, and emerging technology.
This initiative will allow the country’s academic and R&D institutions to upgrade their research facilities, develop
policies, transfer technologies, and ramp up regional initiatives and efforts toward a competitive innovation
ecosystem. Through these R&D centres, the DOST cultivates the innovation landscape in various sectors to
ensure no one is left behind in R&D progress.
Switzerland – The Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE) subsidizes research projects that correspond to the
priorities of the current energy research concept of the SFOE 2021-2024. The focus is on application-oriented
and development-related research projects. The SFOE’s energy research programmes cover the entire spectrum
of energy research and all major technology fields in renewable energies and energy efficiency. There is also a
socio-economic research programme and a programme on the social aspects of dealing with radioactive waste.
Türkiye – The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Türkiye (TÜBİTAK) designs its R&D support
for compliance with the European Green Deal and for mobilizing R&D and innovation accumulation within the
scope of co-creation models. Programmes include the 1501 Industrial R&D Projects Grant Programme and the
1507 SME R&D Start-up Support Programme. Also, the TÜBİTAK 1512 Entrepreneurship Support Programme’s
2021 call targeted R&D and innovation topics within the scope of the European Green Deal Agreement. The
1512 Entrepreneurship Support Programme’s 2022 call also targets green growth. In TÜBİTAK’s new call for
proposals for the “High Technology Platforms Support” and “Industry Innovation Networks Mechanism (SAYEM)”,
areas focusing on sustainable solutions to mitigate and adapt to climate change attracted significant attention.

Technological opportunities for a low-carbon world

Build domestic capabilities along the value chain
To absorb, adapt, and eventually develop, renewable energy industries, countries need to accumulate
local expertise – scientific, technological, managerial, and organizational. Governments can offer support
through public procurement, by stipulating local content requirements and by offering tax incentives
targeted at specific energy facilities, production projects, or types of companies such as joint ventures.141
In South Africa, for example, efforts to promote local tower and blade manufacturers failed because global
multinational companies preferred to operate through long-standing relations with international first-tier
suppliers. The industry need not necessarily focus only on the manufacturing phase. In wind energy, for
example, there are opportunities for efficient domestic service providers to collaborate with lead firms.142
It is also important to build the capacity of SMEs – and particularly to tap the potential of women
entrepreneurs. UNIDO research in Cambodia, Peru, Senegal and South Africa found that women
entrepreneurs were particularly interested in green industries where they believed they had more
opportunities.143 Policymakers can publicise the options for women, while increasing access to technical
vocational education and training, and investing capacity-building. They can also present successful
women entrepreneurs as role models.

Invest in human capital
Dedicated training programmes may be needed to build local specialized scientific, technological,
managerial and organizational capabilities. In Thailand, for example, this happens through universities
and research centres.144 In China, in 2008, the Government launched the “Thousands of Talents Plan”
which offered full-time positions in research institutes and universities with good salaries and benefits. This
attracted many Chinese researchers from western universities who had contributed to fields such as PV
cell technologies.145
Skills are also acquired through learning-by-doing and on-the-job training. In China, for the biomass
industry, state-owned design institutes diffuse technical knowledge and must be involved when
constructing biomass power plants. Often the institutes have learned from pioneer companies and then
disseminated the knowledge to others.146

Collaborate internationally
Participation with international organizations, along with collaboration with other national governments,
and non-governmental organizations will provide valuable information for developing more diverse and
more affordable energy technologies. International collaboration is more common in new industries such
as CSP and green hydrogen – as has happened, for example, between Germany and African countries.
Another example of multilevel collaboration is the Africa- EU Energy Partnership – a forum for political
dialogue, knowledge sharing and peer connection between EU and African stakeholders in renewable
energies.147 At the global level, in 2021, UNIDO launched a global programme for the green hydrogen
industry with the support of the International Hydrogen Energy Centre in Beijing.148
A key area for international cooperation is setting and harmonizing international standards and technical
norms that are then incorporated into national regulations. For green hydrogen, for example, this would
include guarantees of origin, hydrogen purity, equipment specifications, and blending into the gas grid.149
Establishing standards requires extensive consultation with stakeholders, public and private, from
advanced and developing countries.

Reform intellectual property regimes
It will also be important to reform global intellectual property (IP) regimes so as to allow developing countries
ready access to frontier technologies. This involves striking a balance between the disadvantages and
advantages of IP rights. Weaker IP protection may enable companies to take up new ideas, but it could
also discourage innovation. One recent study of 59 countries concluded that on balance stronger IP
protection helps propagate the deployment of renewable energy technologies.150 However, this area
needs more robust empirical research on issues such as novelty requirements, compulsory licensing, and
the length of patent protection.

Diffuse knowledge in the domestic ecosystem
Knowledge gained by leading pioneer companies should be diffused to other enterprises to encourage
broader development. For the Chinese biomass industry, for example, the State encouraged information
spillover to other domestic firms. This was enabled by weak enforcement of intellectual property rights,
which smoothed copying and imitation by domestic competitors. Knowledge flows were also mediated
by State-owned design institutes.151
Another example is the wind industry in Ethiopia, where the Government has asked national universities to
submit proposals to act as consultants for wind projects. The Ministry of Water, Irrigation, and Electricity
has liaised with several domestic universities to engage them in projects and apply their experience.152

CHAPTER IV
TWIN TRANSITIONS
FOR GLOBAL VALUE
CHAINS – GREEN
AND DIGITAL

CHAPTER IV
Twin transitions for global value chains – green and digital

This chapter examines the options for latecomer countries in greening and digitalizing, and the opportunities
to benefit from these twin transitions in global value chains (GVCs). These two processes have largely
developed in parallel but have become increasingly intertwined. Technologies such as AI, cloud computing,
and IoT can also help the economies become greener – while also accelerating progress for all 17 SDGs.
Since the early 1990s, GVCs have become the cornerstone of the world economic system. Through
GVCs, firms specialize in specific tasks and break up the production process across different countries.
Today, about two-thirds of international trade of services and goods comprises transactions within supply
chains. These are often sales of intermediate goods – of parts, components and accessories used to
produce final products.1 Exports of such goods declined in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic
but rose again in 2021, surpassing the pre-pandemic level.2 COVID-19 broke many chains, encouraging
companies to reconfigure and diversify to be more resilient in the face of pandemics and other disruptions,
but GVCs will be important components of world trade for some time to come.3
Many emerging and developing countries have been able to use GVCs based on their specific advantages
and specialization in tasks rather than on final goods. But this kind of production is unlikely to stimulate
sustainable growth: if developing countries are to gather the full benefits of GVCs they will need to move
up the value-added ladders to more sophisticated manufacturing and services.
As they upgrade, companies and countries should also embed social and environment values. Social
upgrading refers to improving the rights and entitlements of workers and their employment. Environmental
upgrading refers to a firm’s ecological footprint, including its use of natural resources, its emission of
greenhouse gases and any destruction of biodiversity.4 These improvements are increasingly being
demanded by consumers who are seeking more ethical products, and by lead firms and global buyers,
and governments. Changes are also being required by social and environmental standards and associated
patterns of upgrading and downgrading across global supply bases.
This chapter focuses on technological and environmental upgrading, and on how GVCs can become
greener by switching to digital frontier technologies associated with smart manufacturing – often referred to
as Industry 4.0. Across the global South, most countries have operating within Industry 3.0, but have yet to
adopt smart manufacturing and services or the more advanced methods of data processing and analysis.
Indeed, many firms in these countries have yet to upgrade to the previous generation of manufacturing or
service technologies. At present only a few countries are using advanced digital technologies, and even
fewer are designing and producing them.5

A. THE GREENING OF GVCS
GVCs can become greener through two main routes. The first is by manufacturing the goods used for
green production, such as, solar PV panels and wind turbines.6 The second is by greening traditional
manufacturing industries, such as food, garments and textiles, leather and shoes, and furniture – all of
which are important for low- and middle-income countries.

1. ENVIRONMENTAL UPGRADING
Environmental upgrading can be defined as any change that reduces a firm’s ecological footprint through
lower greenhouse gas emissions, low natural resource use or less impact on biodiversity.7 As a result, the
process can also use less energy or materials per unit of output. Or the upgrading can be through product
improvements – removing harmful chemicals, for example, and making the products more recyclable
and part of the circular economy. Or the upgrade could be organizational, such as the introduction of
environmental management systems.8
Much of the impetus is coming from consumers. Informed by NGOs, and by the media, including social
media. Consumers are increasingly seeking products and processes that have lower environmental
footprints. They are also considering whole product lifecycles, starting from the sourcing of materials such
as rare earth metals for electric vehicles and wind turbines,9 through the management of chemicals in

OPENING GREEN WINDOWS
Technological opportunities for a low-carbon world

the production of solar PV panels, and then on to what happens after decommissioning, with the reuse
of materials.10 Customers, investors, and policymakers also want greater disclosure and transparency.
At the same time, companies see opportunities not only to respond to consumer demand but also to
make savings, through more efficient manufacturing and better use of materials.
The processes can be considered as a series of steps, starting from the initial demand, through new
designs and product improvements (Figure IV-1).

These changes are transmitted along value chains through new designs, standards and specifications.
Usually, the new designs start in countries that pioneer environmentally benign products, processes
and services – ‘green lead markets’.11 These countries introduce new private standards, defined and
enforced by lead firms. They also internalize several public environmental regulations and semi-private
environmental certifications, such as the Technical Regulations (TRs) Certification (e.g., Round Table on
Responsible Soy), which, beyond the core private sector firms and organizations, includes authorities and
governmental agencies and public donors. The demands for sustainability have implications for the entire
value chain, including its governance – how some firms in the chain set and enforce the parameters under
which others in the chain operate.
The process is rarely smooth. Higher standards can also present barriers. Some suppliers may be unable to
invest in new processes and thus get squeezed out of the value chain.12 But for other enterprises the new
standards signal green windows of opportunity, providing they can realign accordingly.13 Well-functioning
production and innovation systems depend on deeply embedded suppliers who are also flexible.14
This chapter focuses on four types of digitally driven upgrades:
• In product design – Upgrading the product, substituting environmentally harmful components and
products, designing recycled products, designing for durability.
• In production inputs – Changing energy sources, substituting energy-intensive materials or scarce
natural resources and removing toxic inputs.

68

CHAPTER IV
Twin transitions for global value chains – green and digital

• In production process – Reducing waste and energy consumption from the production processes
and optimizing material flows.
• In consumption – Including use, recycling and re-use of waste.

2. THE TWIN TRANSITIONS
The environmental and digital transformations have largely developed in parallel, with their own trajectories
and separate drivers and policy domains. However, this is now beginning to change as they merge into
twin transitions with many functional synergies. This broader potential of digital technologies was also part
of the Sustainable Development Goals which indicated that digitization could enable the changes needed
for a just sustainable transition (Box IV-1).15

Box IV 1
The impact of Industry 4.0 technologies in global value chains
Digitalization is expected to have wide-ranging effects in manufacturing in GVCs.16 It has been argued that
digitalization will put developing countries at a disadvantage since it reduces the need for labour, and thus
reduces the comparative advantage of many developing countries of offering low labour costs.
Companies may thus reshore some activities towards high-income economies.17 However, reshoring remains
a rare phenomenon.18 In the European Union, for example, data from 2,500 firms in eight countries indicates
that the phenomenon has been modest and varies from one industry to another, and that the main driver has
been flexibility in logistics rather than the evening-out of labour costs.19
The impact of Industry 4.0 on GVCs could also depend on the technology. Robots and computerized
manufacturing could reduce the advantage of producing in low-labour-cost countries. Similarly, 3D printing
could shorten GVCs and enable firms to keep production closer to markets, as happened during the COVID-19
pandemic when 3D printing was used to remedy shortages in medical supplies. 3D printing can democratize
manufacturing allowing companies in latecomer countries to engage in manufacturing without large investments,
opening opportunities for distributed local production processes,20 but it can also allow firms from high-income
countries to produce closer to their customers.21
The new technologies can also present new barriers to entry in GVCs in terms of know-how, skilled human
resources, and capital investments. 22 The IoT, for example, could make manufacturing less reliant on low-skilled
labour and more dependent on the availability of engineers, programmers, and other specialized professions,
which are in short supply in many latecomer countries.23
Nevertheless, GVCs do present channels through which developing countries can better engaged with digital
technologies. A UNIDO study in five ‘latecomer’ countries found that, although less than 5 per cent of the
surveyed firms were aware of Industry 4.0 technologies, firms could still integrate the technologies into their
manufacturing processes and become more productive.24
Digital technologies such as IoT and AI could also encourage more SMEs from developing countries to
participate in GVCs by tracking shipments and inventory bridging and thus reducing trade costs.25 AI can help
firms find the fastest, cheapest, and most sustainable routes for shipping goods around the world.
Industry 4.0 technologies could held decentralize advanced activities across regional production networks,
allowing more peripheral locations to house activities such as engineering, design, and software development.
This can help them better serve regional markets.26 For example, Cloudfactory, a United States company
offering data processing services for AI and automation, has opened subsidiaries in Nepal and Kenya. The
company has sliced up its activities, retaining the more advanced parts of the value chain in the United States
headquarters, while employing staff in Nepal and Kenya for data input, quality control and processing – offering
new opportunities for, mainly young, well-trained workers.27

impacts (Box IV-2). They can reduce the carbon footprint of current production and consumption modes
– facilitating the introduction of new green technologies and eco-products and enhancing the diffusion of
business models based on circular economies. Nevertheless, digital technologies may also cause further
environmental degradation due to the use of rare materials in their production, for example, and high
energy consumption entailed in their use.

Box IV 2
Industry 4.0 technologies in mining
Mining might represent a challenge for frontier technologies. It is a relatively difficult sector to develop and apply
technologies like IoT due to its environment, which involves dust, high humidity, and often isolated locations lacking
connectivity.28 This does not mean, however, that the sector must be stuck in the past with traditional methods. In fact,
actors in the industry note that mining is going through the beginning of a profound digital transformation.29
One example is the Syama mine in Mali, which is a purpose-built and fully automated mine. It employs a fibre-optic
network designed to control and monitor activities from above-ground centres, incorporating an automated haulage
system, automated rehandle level, and digitalisation.30 This is expected to generate a cut in costs by around 30 per
cent and improve efficiency and productivity as the machines can operate 22 hours a day without losing time for shift
changes.31
However, taking advantage of the opportunities available by Industry 4.0 technologies involves policy efforts. There
must be investments in infrastructure to support the digitalisation of mines, as well as the provision of education and
training to mitigate the impact on low-skilled labour. Policies and regulations are an important incentive for innovations
in the sector through, for instance, pushing for stricter environmental regulations.32

The more advanced technologies can be considered in two categories (Table IV-1):
1. Smart manufacturing and service technologies – leading to automation and decentralization of
tasks and including advanced robotics, 3D-printing, wireless technologies, and sensors.
2. Data processing technologies – allowing interconnection and data exchange, including big data,
blockchain, cloud computing, and AI.33 What makes these technologies novel is the integration of
hardware, software, and connectivity in complex production systems.34

Table IV 1
Selected industry 4.0 technologies in manufacturing
Technology Description
Smart manufacturing and service technologies
Industrial robots

Robots are programmable machines that carry
out actions and interact with the environment
via sensors and actuators, either autonomously
or semi-autonomously. Industrial robots usually
replace workers, automating almost entirely the
processes on the factory floor. Examples are spot
welding robots used in the auto industry.

Cobots

Cobots are robots that collaborate with humans.
They are easily re-programable, for example, by
a worker guiding the arm of the cobot through a
new path. They can be used in machine tools in a
manufacturing plant, packaging and palletizing.

3D printing

3D printing, also known as additive
manufacturing, produces three-dimensional
objects based on digital information. 3D printing
can create complex objects, with little waste. 3D
printers are used for prototyping and also for final
production in manufacturing.

Internet of Things
(IoT)

IoT refers to internet-enabled physical devices that collect, share and act based on
data. The IoT is vast; typical fields include wearable devices, smart homes, smart
healthcare, smart cities and industrial automation. In manufacturing, IoT connects
traditional machinery and tools with actuators and sensors.

Actuators

An actuator is a component of a machine that
is responsible for moving and controlling a
mechanism or system. It could be pneumatic,
hydraulic, electric, thermal or magnetic. Actuators
could, for example, measure heat or motion to
determine the resulting action in the machine.

Sensors

Sensors detect external and internal conditions
of equipment and products and send that
information through the digital network. They
can measure temperature, humidity, pressure,
proximity and level, and visual and infrared rays.

Data processing technologies
Big data

Big data refers to datasets whose size or type is beyond the ability of traditional
databases to capture, manage and process. Big data also refers to the used of
traditionally inaccessible or unusable data for making decisions.

Artificial intelligence
(AI)

AI is normally defined as the capability of a machine to engage in cognitive activities
typically performed by the human brain. AI is already widely used for applications that
focus on narrow tasks, such as recommending what to buy online, spotting spam or
detecting credit card fraud.

Technological opportunities for a low-carbon world

Smart manufacturing and service technologies
Digital technologies can upgrade GVCs in numerous ways:
Monitoring standards – Standard-setting organizations can use new technologies for monitoring food,
forestry and fisheries.35 Instead of making annual field audits, officials can install fixed or mobile sensors
to collect real-time data. Embedded in harvesting and logging equipment, for example, the sensors can
upload to satellites data on tree species and biodiversity – and help detect illegal logging and fishing.
International organizations such as FAO and the World Bank are now adopting these methods for
monitoring environmental standards.
Logistics – Data collected from online-connected sensors, and from GPS tracking systems, can optimize
logistics and significantly reduce carbon emissions.36
Operating efficiency – Smart manufacturing consumes less energy.37 One plastics multinational, for
example, has used energy sensors and IoT to reduce the power consumption in one of its plants by
around 40 per cent, saving over $200,000 a year in energy costs.38 Similarly, a smartphone manufacturer
in China has optimized the operation of robots to increase productivity by 50 per cent.39
Better design – 3D-printing has been shown to reduce the weight of aircraft parts by 50 per cent and
that of the aircraft by 4 to 7 per cent, with an estimated six per cent drop in fuel consumption.40 This
technology could thus significantly reduce carbon emissions from air travel.41

Data processing technologies
The use of big data analytics, cloud computing, artificial intelligence and blockchain technology can aid
the reduction of environmental impacts in the production, processes or practices involved in the inputs
needed for production:
Artificial intelligence – AI is important for environmental domains such as energy, production and natural
resource management.42 For electricity, for example, firms are using ‘smart grids’, to optimize green
energy use – as well as smart meters, and other equipment. In agriculture, AI can be used for intelligent
food logistics, using sensors and other technologies to plan shipping and delivery of perishable goods
and for monitoring the state of the cargo. Lead firms are increasingly adopting sustainability tools to cut
operational costs, increase product value, and coordinate GVCs. Certifications, codes of conduct, supply
chain reporting, lifecycle assessments, supplier audits, smart packaging, and eco-efficiency programs
may all be aided by AI.
Blockchain – Blockchain is a distributed verification system, in which the authenticity of a transaction
or item is not provided by one institution, such as a bank, but is securely distributed and encrypted
across a network of computers. Blockchain can be used, for example, to provide authentic information
on the origin and sustainability of products,43 Similarly, blockchains can be used for supply chain
management – systems such as Echochain, ElectricChain, and Suncontract44 are tracking faulty products
or components, helping reduce the number of recalls and their environmental impact. 45 Blockchain can
enhance sustainability; the Supply Chain Environmental Analysis Tool for example, traces the carbon
footprint of products, and the Endorsement of the Forestry Certification tool can indicate whether wood is
sustainably sourced. In addition, blockchains have downstream implications, as with the RecycleToCoin
system that enables people to return plastic containers for a financial reward. Nonetheless, such initiatives
must also ensure that recyclers have the appropriate equipment and work conditions since they deal with
potentially hazardous substances, making them vulnerable to a myriad of health risks.46
However, as in other areas, there is always the risk of greenwashing, since AI does not always enhance
sustainability to the extent that companies claim.47 Firm managers may overstate the impact of AI in order
to boost brand and stock values.48

Twin transitions for global value chains – green and digital

Greener relationships along the value chain
In assembly industries, there are many opportunities along the value chains to reduce materials, water
and energy consumption, pollution emission, and waste reduction.49 How this happens and who takes
the initiative will depend on the nature of the relationships between each link in the chain – on the type of
governance (Table IV-2). Governance can be classified as ‘relational’, if buyers and suppliers have reciprocal
trust and long-term relationships and are interacting frequently to share information. Or governance can
be ‘captive’ if there is a degree of monitoring and control by lead fires over small suppliers who are
transactionally dependent, making it difficult to switch. In this case buyer firms may pay for upgrading
service providers, both for reputational and cost-saving reasons.

Table IV 2
Five types of GVC governance
Type

Description

Market

This type has a low degree of explicit coordination and power asymmetry.
Market linkages do not have to be completely transitory, as is typical of spot markets; they
can persist over time, with repeat transactions. The essential point is that the costs of
switching to new partners are low for both parties.

Modular

Typically, suppliers in modular value chains make products to a customer’s specifications,
which may be more or less detailed. Often, ‘turn-key services’ suppliers take full
responsibility for competencies surrounding process technology, use generic machinery
that limits transaction-specific investments, and make capital outlays for components and
materials on behalf of customers.

Relational

In these GVCs, interactions between buyers and sellers are complex, which often creates
mutual dependence and high levels of asset specificity. This may be managed through
reputation or more trust-based ties. Spatial proximity may support relational value chain
linkages, but trust and reputation might well function in spatially dispersed networks
where relationships are built up over time. This type has an intermediate degree of explicit
coordination and power asymmetry.

Captive

In these networks, small suppliers are transactionally dependent on much larger buyers.
Suppliers face significant switching costs and are, therefore, ‘captive’. Such networks
typically have a high degree of monitoring and control by a lead firm.

Hierarchy

This governance form involves vertical integration. The dominant form of governance
is managerial control, flowing from managers to subordinates, or from headquarters to
subsidiaries and affiliates. This type has a high degree of explicit coordination and power
asymmetry.

Source: UNCTAD adapted from Gereffi et (2005).

In Sri Lanka, for example, lead firms use environmental standards as an element of chain coordination.50
In this case, supplier firms comply with environmental standards to increase their competitiveness.51
But not all firms may agree. In the leather industry, for example, producers believe that processing with
chrome has the lowest environmental impacts along the entire chain, while buyers for brands believe that
processing without chrome is better for their image.52
Another example is the maritime industry where a simple option is to reduce vessel speed since emissions are
lower for slow ocean-going vessels53 or to create smart ports (Box IV-3).54 Alliances with cargo-owners and
regulators can also enable technology for onboard monitoring.55 This is in line with the international maritime
organisation’s measures to cut emissions from ships and reach half of 2008 emissions’ level by 2050.56

Box IV 3
The strategic importance of sustainable smart ports
Over 80 per cent of global merchandise trade by volume, and more than 70 per cent by value, is seaborne. International
shipping and ports provide crucial linkages in global supply chains and are essential for the ability of all countries
to access global markets. Ports are critical infrastructure assets that serve as catalysts of economic growth and
development.
UNCTAD has a project to raise awareness among ports and national authorities about the strategic importance of
“Sustainable Smart Ports” (SSP) and in the importance of everyone competing on a level playing field.57 Sustainable
Smart Ports take advantage of the new data environments and the energy transition of the maritime sector, artificial
intelligence and green technology-based solutions to enhance port operational efficiency. They also promote energy
efficiency and clean/renewable energy sustainability, as well as tap into the possibility of producing clean/renewableenergy production and distribution.
Funded by the United Nations Development Account, this $600,000, three-year project started in 2022 and will
support port authorities in Morocco, Ghana and Mauritius to assess the SSP status of their ports and identify and
implement key priority actions.

Supplier squeeze
Lead firms may, however, push the costs of sustainability compliance onto their suppliers, as has happened
in wine and coffee sectors – resulting in ‘supplier squeeze’.58 Higher demands may also raise the barriers
for entry and thus keep out smaller producers and deepen imbalances of power between firms in the
North and South. This is because sustainability measures along GVCs have allowed lead firms, which are
usually from the Global North, to capture new rents, reinforcing imbalances of power between firms in the
Global North and the Global South.
If buyers are to demand higher standards, they will need to support suppliers. European buyers of olive oil
from Tunisia, for example, tried to impose standards but due to a lack of financial and technical assistance,
the extent of environmental upgrading of suppliers remained limited.59
Similarly, in the apparel industry in Pakistan, suppliers see environmental upgrading mainly as a cost,
and a necessary ‘entry ticket’ for GVCs, and will need to invest new technology, certifications, system
modifications and skills development, for which they are not compensated.60

Voluntary sustainability standards
Upgrading value chains can be based on voluntary sustainability standards (VSS). The United Nations
Forum on Sustainability Standards (UNFSS) defines VSS as “standards specifying requirements that
producers, traders, manufacturers, retailers or service providers may be asked to meet, relating to a wide
range of sustainability metrics, including respect for basic human rights, worker health and safety, the
environmental impacts of production, community relations, land-use planning and others”.61 VSS aims to
promote sustainability mainly through collaboration among NGOs, industry groups or multi-stakeholder
groups. By 2020, there were 150 VSS in agriculture and around 30 for mining and industrial products
VSS are gaining ground among diversified, export-oriented economies. Viet Nam, Indonesia and India
score fairly high on VSS adoption, as do Ethiopia and the United Republic of Tanzania whose coffee
exports are certified to meet multiple standards.62
By 2020, the number of voluntary sustainability standards range from 150 in agriculture to around
30 in mining and industrial products (See Box IV-4 for examples from various sectors). In agriculture,
14 VSS organizations cover eight agricultural commodities globally – bananas, cocoa, coffee, cotton, oil
palm, soybeans, sugarcane, tea and forestry products.63 In 2019, those standards certified a minimum
of 20 million hectares of the eight agricultural commodities, around 8 per cent of the global area.64
For bananas, certifications are concentrated in Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador

and Honduras; for cocoa, Côte d’Ivoire; for coffee, Brazil, Central America and Colombia; for palm oil,
Indonesia and Malaysia; for soybeans, Argentina and Brazil; and for sugarcane Brazil.65
For textiles and clothing there are two main standards.66 The Global Organic Textile Standard is recognized
as the world’s leading processing standard for organic fibres, including ecological and social criteria,
independent certification of the entire supply chain.67 The Fairtrade Textile Standard has been produced by
Fairtrade International which supports small producer organizations and agricultural workers in developing
countries.68

Box IV 4
Examples of voluntary sustainability standards
Manufacturing: In textiles: Organic Content Standard (OCS), the Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) and the
Fairtrade Textile Standard. GOTS certified final products may include fibre products, yarns, fabrics, clothes, home
textiles, mattresses, personal hygiene products, and food contact textiles.
Other sustainability standards for manufactured products include: ABNT Ecolabel, ARSO - Agriculture, ASEAN
Guidelines on Promoting Responsible Investment in Food, Agriculture and Forestry, BRCGS Food Safety, Carbon Trust
Product Footprint Certification, East African organic products standard (EAOPS), EcoVadis, Ethical Trading Initiative
(ETI), Fair Labor Association, GreenCo, Recognised - Environmental Credentials Scheme, Global Reporting Initiative
(GRI), ZNU standard, and the Climate, Community & Biodiversity (CCB) Standards. CCBs are used to identify projects
that simultaneously address climate change, support local communities and smallholders, and conserve biodiversity.
As of May 2017, 102 projects in 32 countries have been validated by the CCB Standards. The preponderance of
projects is in tropical developing countries, particularly in Africa.69
Forestry: Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC)
are the two leading VSS at the global level. In 2019, PEFC and FSC certified more than 433.5 million hectares of forest,
representing 10.7 per cent of the global forest area.70
Fishing: The Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) is an international non-profit organisation, which aims to promote
sustainable fish stocks, minimizing environmental impact and ensuring effective fisheries management through the
MSC Fisheries Standard. Developing world fisheries account for around 8 per cent of the total of MSC certified
fisheries and 11 per cent of fisheries. More than 40 developing world fisheries have had pre-assessment and are
engaging in a Fishery Improvement Project with partners.71
Mining: The main sustainability standards include the Alliance for Responsible Mining (ARM), Fairtrade International
(FLO), Fairmined Standard, Fair Stone, IGEP, Responsible Jewellery Council (RJC), Social Accountability International,
the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative Performance Standard, SGE 21, XertifiX. Established in 2004, ARM is a leading
global expert which aims to transform the mining sector into a socially and environmentally responsible activity, through
developing standards and certification systems for responsible artisanal and small-scale mining and facilitate the
access of certified metals to fair supply.72 Likewise, the Fairtrade Standard for Gold and Associated Precious Metals
for Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining makes changes to the conventional trading system. It aims to improve small
producers‘ social and economic well-being and enhance environmental sustainability.73
Energy products: Sustainability standards include the Alliance for Water Stewardship, Carbon Trust Product Footprint
Certification, EO100TM Standard for Responsible Energy Development, Green-e, ISCC Plus, Lasting Initiative for Earth
Certification, TerraChoic, Verified Carbon Standard (VCS), WFTO Guarantee System, SOCIALCARBON® Standard.
To illustrate, the VCS Program provides the standard and framework for independent validation of projects and
programmes, and verification of GHG emission reductions and removals.74 The Round Table on Responsible Soy
(RTRS) is a civil organization that promotes socially equitable, economically feasible and environmentally sound soy
production. The RTRS Standard operates in China, India Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.75
Livestock and tourism: VSS include East African organic products standard, VietFarm, and the Wildlife Friendly
Enterprise Network (WFEN). The WFEN is a global community which unites conservationists, businesses, artisans,
producers and harvesters. Certified Wildlife Friendly enterprises protect threatened and endangered species in Asia,
Africa, Europe and the Americas, conserve over 13 million hectares of diverse wetland, forest and grasslands, and
benefit over 200,000 people who coexist with wildlife.76

3. SLOW DIFFUSION OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES IN LATECOMER COUNTRIES
Thus far, Industry 4.0 technologies are mostly produced and adopted in a few leading economies.77 More
than 90 per cent of all patenting is in ten countries, all high-income except for China.78 For exports the top
ten countries, again including China, account for 70 per cent of the global market. Concentration is lower
for imports: the top ten countries account for only 46 per cent of global imports of these technologies and
include China, Mexico, India and Türkiye.79
For emerging digital technologies, UNIDO has identified the front-runner countries.80 The top ten, are all
high-income countries except for China. After these are 40 countries: 23 producer economies, among
which there are Brazil and India; and 17 user economies comprising Algeria, Argentina, Bangladesh,
Colombia, Indonesia, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Malaysia, Mexico, South Africa, Thailand, Türkiye and
Viet Nam. The remaining countries show low to no activity, but all countries will be affected by the adoption
of digital technologies in the more advanced countries.81
The adoption of digital technologies differs not just by country but also by sector and industry. As might
be expected, the computer and machinery industry leads the way, making the greatest use of cloud
computing and 3D printing technologies, while the transport equipment industry leads for the adoption
of industrial robots.82 In Morocco for example, the automotive industry is making more use of such
technology than the garment industry.83
The countries best placed to move to smart production are those with stronger manufacturing industries
and higher levels of skill. Figure IV-2 gives an indication of readiness, showing the high-skill and technologyintensive manufacturing exports as a percentage of total exports, and high-skill employment as a percentage
of the working population. It is important to emphasise that the figure illustrates a simplified version of the
analysis regarding the relationship between industry 4.0 benefits and manufacturing and labour skill levels.

The lines represent the unweighted global averages in these two indicators, segmenting the countries
into four groups. According to these estimations, clustered in the top-right quadrant are the countries
best placed, which are the United States and many countries in Europe, and in East and South-East Asia.
To the bottom are countries which import high-tech goods, but lack the skills needed for a widespread
diffusion of Industry 4.0. These include China, India, Mexico, Thailand, and Viet Nam. A third group has
the necessary workforce but not the companies to take advantage of them, which may make it difficult
to broaden beyond pockets of technology-intensive manufacturing. This includes many countries that
rely heavily on commodity exports. such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Kazakhstan, and Nigeria. The fourth
group, in the bottom-left quadrant, has neither the high-tech sectors nor the workforces, which applies to
most developing countries.
For many countries, these technologies may seem distant prospects, but all will be affected by them sooner
or later, so they need to anticipate the implications of the fourth industrial revolution on their economic and
social systems.84 Typically, most firms are at the stage of Industry 2.0.85 This was corroborated by a firmlevel survey in Argentina, Brazil, Ghana, Thailand, and Viet Nam.86 For instance, in Ghana most firms were
using analogue or rigid production, typically using computer-aided design only in product development.
In Argentina, only 3 per cent of firms were using digital technologies and in Brazil only 4 per cent.87 These
countries have technological ‘islands’ that lack significant backward and forward linkages within their
domestic economies.88
In Ghana, a recent UNCTAD survey encompassing 500 firms found very low adoption rates of frontier
technologies – 3.6 per cent for industrial robots, 5.2 per cent for cobots, 5.6 per cent for 3D printing,
9.6 per cent for big data and 4.6 percent for virtual reality. The ICT sector had the highest levels, followed
by tourism, agro-processing, pharmaceuticals and textiles (Box IV-5).89 The three main barriers to adopting
digital technology were identified as lack of finance, attachment to existing practices and traditional ways
of doing things, and insufficient support from government.90
In a firm-level study in Bangladesh, local managerial staff were found to know very little about the
potential for digital technologies, or the concepts of the circular economy.91 Similarly, in Brazil companies
in the plastics industry, particularly the smaller ones, had little understanding of the potential for digital
technologies for more sustainable production.92

Box IV 5
A firm-level survey in developing countries
UNCTAD has partnered with researchers from the University of Johannesburg, the Science and Technology Policy
Research Institute of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research of Ghana, and the University of Nice SophiaAntipolis on firm-level innovation surveys in Ghana, South Africa, and Tunisia concerning the deployment and use of
new technologies. This project proposes a framework survey that could be applied in other developing countries
In Ghana, by mid-2022, the survey had been completed in 500 establishments. The survey found high levels of
awareness of frontier technologies but very low levels of adoption. Only 4.1 per cent of the firms surveyed had adopted
Industrial Robots and Virtual Reality, mainly in the agro-processing sector. Firms adopting cobots and 3D Printing
constituted 5.2 per cent, and 5.6 per cent respectively, mainly in textiles and ICT sectors. Highest adoption levels
were for social media at 84 per cent and mobile banking at 71 per cent. The main motivations for adopting these
technologies were seen to be improvements in productivity working conditions and competitiveness.

B. CREATING A TWIN TRANSITION
To seize windows of opportunity created by these technologies, latecomer countries will need to build
digital competency along with the necessary infrastructure and institutions, while building innovation
capacity and overcoming financial barriers.93
This is a task for governments, for the private sector and other stakeholders. The levels of industrialization,
digital infrastructure, technological and productive capacities as well as involvement in GVCs are highly
contextual. Therefore, the strategic responses will differ for emerging developing economies and less
technologically advanced countries.
This section presents a list of critical policy areas that stakeholders in latecomer countries should consider,
accounting for their technological level, existing preconditions, and different involvement in specific GVCs.

Aligning digital and green strategies
Several latecomer countries have national strategies for frontier technologies in the manufacturing sector.
Examples are the ‘Make in India’ and ‘Made in China 2025’ programmes and the ‘Industry 4.0 Agenda’
in Brazil. In Africa, there are currently 83 strategic plans involving renewable energies, in Central and
South America there are 65 plans, and in the Middle East 15.94 Several developing countries have national
strategies for enhancing digitalization, including Thailand, Viet Nam, South Africa, Chile, Argentina, Brazil
and Mexico.95
Nevertheless, in the environmental and energy domain these strategies are often not coordinated with
interventions or initiatives. In Bangladesh for example, footwear manufacturers have been found to have
little motivation for adopting green technologies given the lack of environmental regulations and the general
low level of environmental awareness.96 Another study in Brazil finds that while the environmental laws are
good, these are not linked with industrial policies.97
To take advantage of green windows of opportunity arising from the twin transitions in GVC manufacturing,
policies need to be co-created across the energy-environmental, industrial and foreign investment spheres.
In the EU, Canada and the Nordic-Baltic countries, there is an increasing awareness of opportunities
offered by digitalization for environmental protection and climate action, and of the need to reduce the
environmental impacts of digitalization itself.98

Developing digital infrastructure
As these technologies progress, all countries will need stronger digital infrastructure, in particular highspeed and high-quality Internet connections.99 There are, however, significant technological inequalities.
Concerning the fixed broadband connection, the observed average speed in developed economies
(around 115 megabits per second) was almost eight times that of the least developed countries
(LDCs) (around 15 megabits per second), reflecting infrastructure and technological.100 But the
technology divide is also visible within the same groups of countries and between rural and urban
areas. An UNCTAD survey in 2021 found that 16 per cent of rural populations in LCDs had no access
to any mobile network and 35 per cent could not connect using a mobile device.101 In addition, the
World Bank Enterprise Surveys102 showed that more than 20 per cent of the interviewed companies
in South Asia and around 14 per cent in Sub Saharan Africa identified electricity access as their
biggest obstacle, which impacts their ability to use the Internet. Another constraint is the high cost of
connectivity relative to income.103 Moreover, the lack of reliable Internet access has been underlined
in studies in Brazil104 and India.105
Governments in developing countries should ensure high-quality Internet access. This will mean
public and private investments in ICT infrastructure along with regulations to foster competition in the
telecommunications sector. Governments should also address the connectivity gap between small and
large firms and between urban and rural regions.

78

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2023

CHAPTER IV
Twin transitions for global value chains – green and digital

Some technologies may also need specific regulations. This would be the case for drones, which could
help deliver lightweight, high-value goods, such as medical supplies, to remote areas. For instance,
Rwanda is now allowing airspace to be accessed by pilotless aircraft.106

Building digital skills
UNCTAD has identified skills at four different levels – for adopting technologies, for basic use, for adapting
technologies, and finally for creating new ones.107 For developing countries it is particularly important to
have the capacity to adapt and modify technologies since these are likely to be used in circumstances
different from those in which they were originally developed.
Governments need to support businesses, including SMEs, to help them build digital skills in areas such
as market research, product development, sourcing, production, sales, and after-sales services.108 Special
consideration should be given to women in informal and artisanal small and microenterprises, particularly
for entrepreneurs.109
In Malaysia, for example, the Penang Skill Development Centre provides technical knowledge and
organizes training programmes for advanced industrial operations.110 Another relevant institution in
Malaysia is CREST, an R&D consortium that researches Industry 4.0 topics and provides scholarships
for advanced degrees. In Thailand, the Government, in collaboration with the Government of Japan,
has established the Automotive Human Resource Development Program to upgrade the skills of local
suppliers: domestic universities and research institutes are training engineers and technicians in AI,
robotics, and mechatronics.
Countries also need to reduce brain drain, retain skilled professionals, and attract skilled expatriates. An
interesting example is the NerUzh program in Armenia, which offers start-up funding designed to attract
potential tech entrepreneurs from the diaspora.111

Building international partnerships
In the European Union, 26 member states, along with Norway and Iceland, have signed a declaration to
accelerate the use of green digital technologies, deploy energy-efficient AI solutions and introduce digital
passports to track products and improve circularity and sustainability.112
Developing countries in particular can benefit from participation in international projects and organizations.113
An example is Prospecta Americas, a regional programme aimed at improving knowledge about
technologies such as big data, AI, IoT, robotics, blockchain, and at evaluating their economic, social and
environmental impact across OAS member states.114 Another example is the UNIDO multi-stakeholder
platform for sharing available tools and methods for digital transformation among SMEs.115
The UNDP is supporting projects aimed at building cross-sectoral ecosystems of partnerships across
governments, companies, and NGOs. In Armenia, for example, the ImpactAim Venture Accelerator, in
cooperation with the Enterprise Incubator Foundation, Innovative Solutions and Technologies Center
Foundation, is supporting energy efficiency and exploring the application of AI and data sciences in the
environmental field. The project is accelerating 33 start-ups in Armenia, two in Belarus and one in the
Philippines116. Accelerators and incubators can facilitate learning and diffuse knowledge through best
practices and demonstration projects.

Setting standards and regulations
Following international standards helps ensure interoperability and promotes productivity and innovation.
Standardization offers obvious benefits in international trade networks and within global value chains –
strengthening SDG pillars and their impact on the environment.117 Regulations and standards are also
important for securing data privacy.118 In the case of 5G technology standard setting also involves political
considerations.119

OPENING GREEN WINDOWS
Technological opportunities for a low-carbon world

The International Communication Union (ITU) publishes international standards related to industry 4.0 and
associated technologies such IoT. These standards are available free of charge for downloading and use
in developing countries. ITU also organizes events that enable countries to obtain new knowledge and
works with developing countries to bridge standardization gaps and assist them to become more involved
in standardization activities.120 The ITU has established focus groups that address the environmental
efficiency industry of 4.0 technologies, as well as water and energy consumption, and provide guidance
on how to operate these technologies in a more environmentally efficient manner.121

Providing financial support
Most developing countries have few resources for R&D programmes in digital and green technologies and
the use of Industry 4.0. Smaller companies in particular find it difficult to make the necessary investments.
In India for example, such companies have struggled to invest in the necessary technology in the
automotive, metals and machinery, food, textile, and electrical equipment industries.122 Similarly in Brazil
many companies lack the necessary investment funds.123, 124
If companies are to combine both green and digital objectives, they will need convincing evidence about
the return on investment. In Brazil for example most companies investing in digital technologies are doing
so primarily to boost productivity.125 For this purpose, the public sector, in partnership with international
donors and development banks, needs to set up demonstration projects.126
A number of countries have established innovation and technology funds, sometimes in collaboration
with international donors or multinational development banks
• Malaysia – The Bank Pembangunan has allocated RM3 billion in its Industry Digitalisation
Transformation Fund (IDTF).127
• Peru – The ProInnovate Program funds and provides technical support for Industry 4.0 projects.
• Türkiye – Small and Medium Enterprises Development Organization of Turkey (KOSGEB) funds
SME investment projects products medium-high and high-technology manufacturing.
• Philippines – The small enterprise technology program (SETUP) offer seed funds for acquiring
technology along with training and other forms of support.128
• South Africa – The post-COVID recover plan129 includes support for MSMEs for green innovation,
and an artificial intelligence institute.130
• Uganda – Uganda Green Enterprise Finance Accelerator facilitates the flow of green finance by
strengthening green SMEs and improving available financial mechanism.131
These activities are complemented with foreign direct investment (FDI). Governments can encourage FDI
with public investments infrastructure and offering incentives for companies that adopt green and digital
technologies.132 An example is the Green Channel initiative in Latvia, which offers a fast track for FDI in
fields such as ICT, bioeconomy, smart materials, smart energy, and mobility.133

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2023

CHAPTER V
Pathways to more complex and sustainable production

Developing countries need to diversify their economies towards sectors that have lower carbon emissions
(see Box V-1).1 In low-income developing countries, economic diversification involves emulating industries
in more developed countries – a steady progression that builds on existing industries – it is thus ‘pathdependent’.2 If a country already has the capacity for machinery or electronics production, it can more
easily move in a number of directions that build upon this competence. But if it is largely producing primary
products, it has fewer starting points. And when basic technologies need to be learned or transferred from
abroad, then innovation is likely to require greater government support.3
If developing countries follow the previous growth path of the developed countries, then global greenhouse
gas emissions will continue to increase rapidly.4 Analyses of the historical experience are mixed. Some
studies indicate that moving to more complex products leads to an initial increase in greenhouse gas
emissions per unit of output, followed by a decline.5 Others have found that increasing economic
complexity results in better overall ecological performance.6
In either case, countries will need to aim in greener directions, particularly through the use of renewable
energy, and concentrating on more knowledge-intensive industries.7 But whatever path they choose,
governments in low- and lower-middle-income developing countries have to act strategically, quickly and
decisively; otherwise, they will be left further behind.8

Box V 1
Transforming economies through diversification
Transforming economies through diversification is one of the four major transformation needs identified in UNCTAD XV’s
outcome document, the “Bridgetown Covenant: From inequality and vulnerability to prosperity for all,” to move to
a more resilient, digital and inclusive world of shared prosperity.9 This reemphasizes UNCTAD’s focus on helping
countries understand the benefits and the policies required to foster diversification.
In addition to its technical cooperation programmes which have advised countries in harnessing trade, investment and
technology for structural transformation, UNCTAD has produced several Reports on the topic. Some recent examples
are:
•

The Least Developed Countries Report 2022 - The path towards the green structural transformation of the
LDCs, which provides elements to help LDCs better understand where they stand in terms of historical
responsibilities for climate change, the impact of their participation in the global economy, including GVCs,
on material use and carbon emissions, the impact of unilateral trade policies with environmental goals by their
trading partners on the sustainable structural transformation of LDCs, and the policy options available for these
countries and their development partners to help put their economies on a greener path.

•

The Economic Development in Africa Report 2022 - Rethinking the Foundations of Export Diversification in
Africa: The catalytic role of business and financial services, which examined how countries can help foster the
growth of a highly competitive, technology-intensive services sector in Africa to drive export diversification.10
The Report showed how African countries could increase manufacturing productivity, driving the region’s
economic growth and structural transformation, by addressing barriers to trade in services, boosting relevant
skills and improving access to innovative alternative financing.

•

UNCTAD’s Catalogue of Diversification Opportunities 2022,11 which presents potential new products for
export diversification for 233 economies based on analysing their economic complexity and position in the
product space. Its objective is to inform governments, the private sector and other stakeholders of the national
innovation systems on possible directions for technological transformation of these economies. The catalogue
presents information on four main areas: 1) basic statistics regarding diversification, 2) potential new sectors
for diversification, considering all products and the markets that offer growing export opportunities, 3) potential
new sectors for diversification considering only agri-business products and the markets that offer growing
export opportunities, and 4) examples of potential new products with higher export opportunities.

OPENING GREEN WINDOWS
Technological opportunities for a low-carbon world

A. IDENTIFYING GREENER PRODUCTION
To help countries choose greener pathways, UNCTAD has produced indices of economic complexity
and carbon footprints for over 43,000 products exported in international markets.12 This analysis shows
that within each industry, there is a range of carbon emissions similar to a statistically normal distribution.
This is illustrated in Figure V-1 which indicates that for apparel the average emissions are lower, with the
distribution shifted to the left, while for live animals there is a greater weight on the right.

Note:
On the horizontal axis, zero represents the global average, and 1 is the standard deviation of the distribution. The
vertical axis shows the frequency in which a level of carbon emissions is associated with products within a sector.

The result is similar when considering the output of countries – which generally have products from low
to high carbon footprints. This is illustrated in Figure V-2 for Bangladesh, Thailand and the Republic of
Korea in 2010. For Thailand and the Republic of Korea the distribution is close to the global average while
Bangladesh’s product mix is shifted to the left with a lower carbon footprint.

When this output and consumption is taking place in a country that is growing from a low base, there
is likely to be an increase in carbon emissions per capita. Over the past two decades, however, that
link seems to have been weakening, so that increasing complexity is less likely to result in increasing
emissions. As the product mix becomes more complex and more sophisticated, carbon emissions fall per
unit of GDP (Figure V-3).

B. PATHS TO GREENER PRODUCTION
Generally, as countries move from agriculture to industry and to medium and high-tech manufacturing
there is an increase in ‘complexity’ which refers to higher levels of technology to be produced.13 Increasing
complexity does not necessarily lead to greener production. Much will depend on the product mix.
Figure V-4 compares indices of product complexity and carbon emissions by sectors. The less complex
sectors that also have lower carbon footprints are textiles, vegetable products, foodstuffs and footwear.
The sectors that are more complex and have higher carbon footprints are chemicals and allied industries,
metals and mineral products.

the countries that have increased their complexity the most are India, Poland, China, Türkiye, Romania,
Czech Republic, Viet Nam, Latvia, Lithuania, Bulgaria, and Serbia. These countries have generally also
increased their index of emissions per capita. On the other hand, countries have reduced complexity and
their indices of carbon emissions include the United States and the United Kingdom.

China – In the period before entering WTO in 2001, China diversified towards products with about the
same level of carbon emissions per capita, using roughly the same technologies. Subsequently, the
country diversified towards output that involved higher carbon emissions per capita (Figure V-6).

On both axes, zero represents the global average, and 1 is the standard deviation of the distribution.

India – Here the rapid increase in the index of carbon emissions per capita was in 2010, though less
pronounced than in China. The index of emissions per capita for India is, nevertheless, still much lower
than the global average.
Viet Nam – From 1995 to 2018, the country moved from below to above average economic complexity.
The increase was faster following the global financial crisis, but the increase in carbon emissions per
capita was far below the global average (Box V-2).
Latvia – Since the 2000s, complexity and the index of carbon emissions per capita have increased at a
fairly constant rate. The increase in complexity has been accompanied by increasing carbon efficiency,
particularly between 1995 and 2007. The index of carbon emissions is below the global average (Box V-3).

Box V 2
Viet Nam thrives with foreign direct investment
Over the past 30 years, the economy has witness unparalleled changes. From one of the poorest nations, Viet Nam
has grown into a lower middle-income emerging economy. Between the 1990s and 2019 the poverty rate declined
from above 70 per cent to below 6 per cent with average per capita income of $2,700.14 Average economic growth
was almost 7 per cent. This has involved structural transformations away from agriculture to include machinery,
footwear, and electronics.
Rapid economic growth has been fuelled by foreign direct investment which between 1990 and 2018 rose from
$180 million to $15.5 billion.15 Beyond footwear and textiles and garments, FDI intensified in industries such as
electronics and electrical equipment.
The increase in FDI was a response to national-level strategies. In 1987, the Law on Foreign Investment allowed for
FDI via joint state-private ventures and wholly foreign-owned corporations. This was followed in the 1990s by laws
on land ownership, and on private enterprise. The 1992 Constitution further encouraged FDI by providing for state
guarantee of ownership.
Viet Nam explored new comparative advantages in electronic and telecommunication equipment products through
foreign direct investment and active participation in the Asian electronic regional network.16
The enhanced economic diversification can be linked to Viet Nam’s active participation in international agreements,
whether bilateral, plurilateral or through membership of ASEAN. Viet Nam signed the Textile and garment trade
agreement with European Community in 1992, acceded to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in
1995, and normalized political relations with the United States in the same year. In 1998, Viet Nam joined APEC, and
signed the US-Viet Nam Bilateral Trade Agreement in 2000. Assertive international integration culminated in accession
to the WTO in 2007 which has enhanced diversification and participation in GVCs. In 2015, Viet Nam engaged with
Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations.
Due to Viet Nam’s continuing efforts to integrate into the global trade and investment system, exports of goods and
services grow constantly even when neighbouring countries have stagnated or deteriorated.17
The Government has established special economic zones (SEZS) which between 2000 and 2014 have attracted
$257 billion in FDI. SEZs contribute to 40 per cent of national industrial output and over 50 per cent of export value.18
Viet Nam has also invested in science and innovation, creating 17 key national laboratories in the mid-1990s. The Law
on Science and Technology and S&T Development Strategy (2003) further paved the way for transformation towards
a fully-fledged and functional innovation system. 19
Despite economic growth, Viet Nam’s current development path has not led to a lower carbon footprint of production.
In 2021, Viet Nam adopted the National Green Growth Strategy for the 2021-2030 period, Vision to 2050.20
The overall goal of the strategy is to accelerate the process of restructuring the economy in association with growth
model transformation to achieve economic prosperity, environmentally sustainability, and social equality. It also aims to
facilitate the transition to a green and carbon neutral economy and contribute to reducing global warming.

Box V 3
Latvia increases complexity through regional clusters
The expansion and diversification of Latvia’s trade from 1995 can be divided into two main periods. The first from 1995
to 2007 involved an intensification of commodity trade and transport when exports were divided equally between
services, transport, agricultural goods, and minerals fuels. The second after the financial crisis from 2008-09 saw
a shift towards higher value-added production in electronics and chemicals. From 2009 to 2020, the contribution
of services was about 25 per cent, of agricultural products around 19 per cent, of electronics 8 per cent, and of
chemicals 8 per cent.
Latvia joined the World Trade Organization in 1999 and the European Union in 2004, and in 2014 the euro became
the country’s currency. The process of joining the European Union has created favourable supply and demand factors
that contributed to the expansion and diversification of Latvia’s exports. With support from the European Regional
Development Fund, Latvia shifted towards electronics and other priority sectors.
From 2009 to 2012, the Government focused on improving the general business environment with direct subsidies and
grants to priority sectors aiming to remove constraints.21 One key policy instrument was the development of regional
clusters. The Government led by the Ministry of Economics also supports networking and promotes cooperation
among business, research, educational, and other institutions During the period 2009-2015, in total, 13 clusters were
supported, of which 11 are in the Riga region: chemistry and pharmacy, furniture, food, IT, mechanical engineering and
metalworking, electrical engineering and electronics, light industry, timber construction, sustainable tourism, Industrial
energy efficiency, and clean technology cluster.22

Greener products
Identifying suitable production paths thus is neither easy nor intuitive. Table V-1 lists the world’s top
20 products in terms of product complexity and greener production. These are relatively expensive – and
involve a larger number of professions, from design to high-precision manufacturing to branding. They
are very diverse – ranging from primary commodities such as cocoa paste to precision manufacturing
products such as clocks. This list even includes coke, semi-coke of coal, lignite, and gas-fuelled pocket
lighters. But their diversity is encouraging since it indicates countries do not need to produce the same
things but rather can choose their own unique paths.

In the measures of complexity, index of CO2 per capita and index of CO2 per GDP, zero represents the global
average, and 1 is the standard deviation of the distribution.

C. COMPLEXITY AND GREENNESS
For this report, UNCTAD investigated the connection between carbon footprints and complexity for over
100 economies over the period 1996 to 2015.23 The analysis considers the influences on carbon emissions
of economic complexity, FDI, trade openness, innovation measures, and environmental policy stringency.
It assesses the impact of previous CO2 emissions, GDP per capita, population, energy intensity, and
electricity production from oil, gas and coal. The results are summarized in Table V-2.

Economic complexity – Initially, economic expansion and a greater use of resources increases the carbon
footprint. Later however, more complex and sophisticated products can embed environmentally friendly
technologies.24 Notably, the initial temporary increase is less for developing countries. There is also some
evidence that long-term reduction effect is greater in developing countries25 – opening up windows for
addressing employment, economic growth and environmental sustainability, and for their firms to adopt
sustainable practices in their supply chains.26
Energy use – This depends on intensity and type of energy use. Emissions will increase if primary energy
and electricity production is from oil, gas or coal.
Foreign direct investment – FDI can help developing countries move to more complex production but
generally at the expense of higher levels of emissions.27
Trade openness – Trade with other countries generally enhances complexity, while also diffusing green
technologies, spreading better environmental practices, and fostering investment in renewable energy.28
Meanwhile, increase in trade can also lead to an increase in energy consumption, which in turn causes
increased environmental degradation. Therefore, this reduction effect is less in developing countries with
more relaxed or non-enforced regulations. This underlines the importance of strengthening environmental
regulations and giving preference to trade opportunities that can facilitate clean technology transfer and
build green innovation capacities.
Research and development – Historically having more people working in R&D has increased carbon
emissions since many researchers have been working on fossil energy.29 On the other hand increasing
R&D expenditures on renewable energy seems to have no significant impact on CO2 emissions probably
because of the persistently low use of renewable energy.30 It is also worth noting that R&D expenditure
increases emissions intensity less as countries become more open to trade.
Energy intensity – Having primary energy and electricity production from oil and gas is associated with
higher complexity but also higher emissions.31 Policymakers should break away from the energy path
dependency and ensure that renewable energy is more competitive.32
Environmental policy – Empirical literature suggests an inverted U-shaped relationship. Initially stringent
policies only lead to improvements in the environment beyond a certain threshold.33

Pathways to more complex and sustainable production

Opportunities for diversification
When the existing product mix is limited, countries have more options to diversify in greener directions
(Box V-4). For the UNCTAD analysis this remains true for up to around 3,000 products. Beyond that point,
the number of potential new products that are both more complex and greener tends to fall off (Figure V-7).
Initially, developing countries can diversify largely by emulating the paths of other countries. But those
opportunities diminish as diversity increases, so countries need to set their own paths. For China, Brazil,
India and South Africa, for example, the more important strategy is now innovation. They thus have to
increase support to R&D and the creation of original knowledge and new and greener products. This
will increase the opportunities for entrepreneurs to discover and invest in business with better social
outcomes.

While most countries can diversify to more complex products, some are in a better position to achieve
greener outcomes. These include Andorra, Barbados, Cameroon, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, Dominican
Republic, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Honduras, Kenya, Panama, Saint Lucia, Senegal, Sri Lanka,
and Uganda. This may start with import substitution. In Figure V-8 this shows opportunities for developing
countries such as Iran and Kenya as well as developed countries such as Finland.

Box V 4
Opportunities for green diversification
The figure below shows the number of opportunities relative to the number of existing products in a country’s product
mix. Each dot represents one of the 234 economies analysed. The position of the blue dots represents the number of
existing products and the number of potential new products for diversification given its proximity in the product space.
The red dots add another requirement. They represent the number of existing products and potential new products
that are close in the product space and that have complexity higher than the average complexity for that country. At
lower levels of diversification there is a sizeable difference between the blue and red dots, but when countries move
past 10,000 products, the difference becomes smaller.
The green dots add the further requirement of carbon emissions lower than the global average. For countries with low
levels of diversification, the green requirement does not reduce the number of opportunities. On the other hand, as
countries diversify it becomes harder to find new products that are both more complex and greener.
Orange dots in the figure represent new opportunities for diversification that are more complex and are associated with
lower carbon emissions per capita and per GDP. In this case, the extra requirement makes it harder for less diversified
countries to find these opportunities. Therefore, as countries diversify, the likelihood of further diversifying towards
more complex and greener products change in a non-linear away, which is summarized in the figure below.

D. OPPORTUNITIES FOR GREENER PRODUCTION
Identifying and prioritizing new sectors
For selecting more complex and greener directions, policymakers are faced with incomplete information
as well as continuing changes in technology and demand. Governments must therefore strengthen
their capacities for assessing and analysing potential new sectors. This will mean taking into account
the country’s existing technological and productive capacities and the availability of natural resources
such as wind or agricultural waste. They also need to consider how their companies can fit into global
value chains. And, as green windows open, policymakers must be prepared to adjust their institutional
frameworks.
These assessments should be participatory and involve a wide range of stakeholders. Within government,
for example, this would include ministries of science, technology and innovation, trade, industry, and
education – all of which can increase national STI capacity and improve systems of innovation. In this,
they can be supported by specialized academic and research institutions. Policymakers also need to
draw in expertise from the private sector, people who know what it takes to build capacity within firms
and who understand the business environment. Just as important, they need to engage with civil society
organizations who know the concerns and priorities of those in vulnerable situations. And throughout
all this they should balance the contributions of women and men to ensure clear gender perspectives.
This will require all the essential trade and industry data, with the latest information on what the country
is producing and exporting (Figure V-10). Policymakers can then apply concepts such as ‘growth
diagnostics economic complexity’ and ‘product space’. The evaluation can also take advantage of
international resources, such as UNCTAD’s Catalogue of Diversification Opportunities 2022,34 the ITC

Governments, the private sector and development partners can then consider each product, taking into
account social, economic and environmental considerations. They can look at them from the perspective
of job creation for example, and in particular for boosting women’s employment. They can consider what
infrastructure is required and how it uses resources, including water, FDI-based light manufacturing, or
any other strategy for industrialization.
This interactive process should produce a shortlist of potential products and will need to be repeated
every few years to take into account changes in the countries’ production structures and in opportunities
in international markets.

Fostering new sectors
Countries that want to compete in new sectors, will need ‘infant industry’ policies to enable entrant firms
to reach the levels of productivity required to compete with more technologically advanced countries.
Subsequently this support can be phased out so that further increases in productivity are guided by
competition and market incentives.37
To foster green technology, governments can also take specific measures such as establishing clusters
of industries developing green technology, starting pilot and demonstration projects, and setting out
technology road maps (Box V-5).38
In China, for example, the government has established “megaprojects of science-research” to build
knowledge and experience within domestic firms, who can learn through experimentation with different
technical designs.39 Similarly, in Chile with the involvement of international investors the National
Development Agency (CORFO) is setting up several pilot projects to support the development of a green
hydrogen industry.
All these activities will need finance, which can be through dedicated funds. In Austria, for example,
the Ministry of Climate Protection and Environment planned to implement a €300-million investment
subsidy budget for green energy in 2022.40 In Belgium, the Walloon Government plans to invest more
than €160 million to lay the foundations for the hydrogen and synthetic fuels economy.41

Instruments for fostering green technologies
Clusters
Austria – To strengthen hydrogen research and contribute to the national hydrogen strategy, Graz University
of Technology and Montanuniversität Leoben are intensifying their activities through a hydrogen cluster that
comprises 19 universities and research institutes and several companies in Austria’s Green Tech Valley.42
Belgium – Created in 2011, GreenWin is a regional competitiveness cluster in Wallonia dedicated to the industrial
and environmental transition of chemicals, innovative construction and renovation processes and materials, and
environmental technologies (Green Techs). GreenWin organizes unlikely encounters between companies of all sizes,
the academic and scientific communities and key partners to consider new products. The goal is to stimulate the
creation of complete value chains in Wallonia, generate new sustainable, eco-responsible and non-relocatable
industrial sectors, and contribute to creating and maintaining sustainable Walloon jobs. To this end, each project
supported by GreenWin is subject to a life cycle analysis.43
Belarus – Electrotransport is an innovation and industrial cluster that has been created to develop and manufacture
new means of electric transport and its components and to coordinate the research and technology, education and
industry sectors. Several electric vehicles have been developed within the cluster, for example, electric buses, and
autonomous trolleybuses.
Demonstration areas and projects
Philippines – The Department of Science and Technology (DOST) Region IVB Office, through its Provincial S&T
Office in Marinduque led the 6M-project on the deployment of solar energy systems to 29 rural health units
regionwide. The DOST Marinduque office also serves as a demonstration area for “green building” using solar
energy systems. As a result, different government agencies in the province signified interest in adopting solar
energy systems.
India – The Department of Science & Technology (DST) works at the initial stages of the technology and innovation
chain for cleaner, more productive, and competitive production. DST supports R&D, technology concepts,
experimental proof, and technology demonstration projects on Clean Energy.
Russian Federation – In February 2021, a pilot programme was launched to deploy plots of land as ‘carbon
polygons’. Within a carbon polygon, highly qualified personnel can develop and test technologies for controlling the
balance of climatically active gases in natural ecosystems. In addition, the polygon provides training in state-of-theart methods of environmental control, advanced technologies for low-carbon industry, agriculture and municipal
economy. The initiative is expected to play a key role in developing a reliable nationwide system for monitoring
greenhouse gas emissions in ecosystems.
Switzerland – The Swiss Federal Office of Energy Pilot and Demonstration Program supports the development
and testing of new technologies, solutions and approaches in the area of ​​economical and efficient use of energy,
energy transmission and storage as well as the use of renewable energies. The programme is positioned at the
interface between research and the market and aims to bring new technologies to market maturity. 44
Technology roadmaps
Türkiye – The Ministry of Industry and Technology and TÜBİTAK are carrying out “Green Growth Technology
Roadmap” studies for the iron-steel, aluminium, cement, chemicals, plastics and fertilizer sectors – which are critical
for the Turkish economy and have high carbon emissions. Priority R&D and innovation themes will be detailed, in
cooperation with the Ministry of Industry and Technology, leading to STI and investment support programmes to
enable private sector organizations to adapt to green transitions.45
Chile – The economic development agency, CORFO, has developed the “Transforma” Strategic Programmes,
including the Roadmap for the Sustainable Management of Construction and Demolition Waste, and the Ministry of
Agriculture has drawn up the roadmap, Circular Economy of Agroindustry.46
Peru – The Roadmap towards a Circular Economy in the Industry Sector was approved to establish State actions to

Participating in global value chains
By participating in global value chains countries can diversify – producing and exporting new products
or upgrading existing output to have greater value added. 47 Some policies for promoting integration into
GVCs are improving transportation infrastructure, as well as supporting for trade and for trade facilitation,
lowering tariff and non-tariff barriers particularly for intermediate goods, and lowering barriers to trade in
services. Other less targeted policies are investing in basic and dedicated education, fostering universityindustry linkages, and reforming intellectual property laws and patent processes.48
Within value chains governments can consider more targeted policies, such as support for small and
medium-size enterprises with finance for new machinery and other requirements for upgrading. They can
also create training or demonstration centres as well as industrial institutes.

The term economic complexity refers to the level
of non-tradable capabilities in the economy as
defined in the strand of literature on economic
complexity (see, for example, the seminal paper
Hidalgo and Hausmann, 2009, and a review of
this literature in (Freire, 2021b)). More complex
products are considered to require higher levels
of technology to be produced. The index of
carbon footprint of a product assesses the
level of carbon emissions per capita associated
with the countries that export that product. The
methodology for the calculation of these indices
is presented in the background paper prepared
for this chapter: Freire (2023). Opportunities in
greener diversification trajectories. Available at
https://unctad.org/webflyer/technology-andinnovation-report-2023.

Furthermore, UNCTAD research conducted the
subgroup analysis for developed and developing
countries on the link between economic complexity
and carbon emissions, which corroborates the
robustness of our previous findings. For more

FDI has the potential to contribute to increasing
complexity of production in developing countries,
but historically it is associated with higher levels
of emission in the receiving countries (e.g., Omri
et al., 2014; Shahbaz et al., 2015). FDI inflows
may provide direct capital financing, generate
positive externality to stimulate further economic
growth, which eventually leads to environmental
degradation (Lee, 2013).

term of GDP exerts a negative and significant

UNCTAD research also identifies a positive

from a reverse causality. Moreover, the quadratic

INTERNATIONAL
COLLABORATION
FOR MORE
SUSTAINABLE
PRODUCTION

CHAPTER VI
International collaboration for more sustainable production

The least technologically able countries lack many preconditions for seizing green opportunities, such
as effective sectoral innovation systems, the required digital infrastructure, or adequate finance. These
countries may thus depend on the support of the international community – through an enhanced
architecture that facilitates sustainable global growth.1 At present, however, there is little international
cooperation for green innovation.
Innovation will require novel business models, new approaches to financing, and policy innovations within
national and global institutions.2 As developing countries’ technological needs and capabilities change
and international political and economic landscapes shift, support for innovation also has to evolve.3
This support should be based on equitable partnerships to build local innovation capabilities and marshal
the necessary technologies. Collaboration can promote access to green technologies for climate change
mitigation and adaptation, human resource development, and building local capacity.4 Such technology
transfer can facilitate the enhancement of national capabilities, adding to the accumulation of knowledge
necessary for countries to promote the structural change of the economy. 5
Effective innovation transfer not only offers capital goods and equipment, but it also enables people
to develop the skills needed to operate and maintain the equipment (know-how) and understand why
it is running (know-why).6 These capabilities are essential for green technologies, which typically need
adaptation to specific conditions on the ground. Enabling and empowering developing countries to take
advantage of green windows of opportunities and build national innovation systems thus requires broad
and comprehensive international cooperation strategies.

A. COOPERATING FOR GREEN INNOVATION
1. A WIDENING NORTH-SOUTH DIVIDE
The gap between developed and developing countries is evident in the expenditure on research and
development (R&D). Many countries in the European Union reach R&D expenditure of 3 per cent of
GDP, while the top global performers, such as Israel and the Republic of Korea, invest around 5 per cent
(Table VI-1). For developing countries, the proportions are far lower. Only a few are around 1 per cent,
such as Brazil, Egypt, Thailand and Türkiye, while others, such as South Africa and Viet Nam, range
between 0.5 and 1 per cent. Mexico and Colombia invest around 0.3 per cent. The average for the lower
middle-income countries is 0.53 per cent.

Another concern is that even the relatively advanced developing countries have not increased that
expenditure. In Brazil, between 2013 and 2019, R&D expenditure as a percentage of GDP was largely
unchanged at 1.2 per cent, while in South Africa, it decreased from 0.66 to 0.62 per cent. Exceptions
were Thailand, where between 2013 and 2018, the figure grew from 0.44 to 1.14 per cent, and Egypt,
which grew from 0.64 to 0.96 per cent.
Other important indicators of the strengths of national innovation systems are the percentage of researchers
per million inhabitants (Table VI-2) and the number of scientific and technical papers published in journals
(Table VI-3). This latter table separates China from the statistical group of middle-income countries, as
48 per cent of the total number of publications from that group are from China.

Note:
The table separates China from the statistical group of middle-income countries, as 48 per cent of the total
number of publications from the group are from China.

Even in fields critical for the global South, most of the science is carried out in the North. One analysis found
that between 2000 and 2014, for the 93,584 publications on climate change, more than 85 per cent of
author affiliations were from OECD countries, less than 10 per cent were from any country in the South, and
only 1.1 per cent were from low-income economies.7 This has the effect of narrowing research paradigms to
the cultural settings and perspectives of the global North and of countries mainly in the West, while depriving
the scientific community of considerable intellectual capital. Similarly, only 10 per cent of funding for health
research is spent in the South, which has 90 per cent of the world’s disease burden.8
Another important perspective is shown by the number of patents granted for green technologies. 9
These have been increasing, but primarily in the traditional industrial economies and newly industrialized
economies (Table VI-4).

6,200 patents granted in the United States Patent Office (USPTO) were to inventors from China – two per
cent of all patents.10 This is a remarkable result, given that relatively few patents had been granted in the
previous 25 years. None of the other emerging economies has registered many patents and the gap with
the industrialized world does not seem to be narrowing. Between 1980 and 2009, only 1 per cent of all
international patents in clean energy were filed in Africa, and 85 per cent of these came from South
Africa.11 In the majority of Lower Middle-Income Countries and Low-Income Countries, patenting activities
are hardly measurable.

2. ODA FOR GREEN INNOVATION
Following the Paris Agreement of 2015, most countries have increased their climate-change-related, green
official development assistance (ODA). 12 In 2016/2017, many large international donors committed at
least 40 per cent of their development assistance as green ODA (Table VI-6). Nevertheless, ODA directed
to green innovation urgently needs to increase.

In general, climate finance is still falling far short. Reaching net zero by 2050 will require around $4 trillion
in annual investment in clean energy by 2030.13 At present, only around $520 billion is available for climate
finance per year, and only about $130 billion of this is being spent in developing countries.14
The primary instrument of public climate finance for developing countries is ODA.15 Between 2012
and 2020, as reported by bilateral donors, the absolute value of climate-related ODA increased from
$23.2 billion to $52.9 billion (Figure VI-1).16 However, this falls short of the Paris Agreement pledge of
$100 billion per year by 2020. It should also be noted that this reflects commitments, not disbursements
which are typically considerably less.

Of total green ODA, 41 per cent went to Asia, and 25 per cent to Africa (Figure VI-3). One concern is the
use of debt instruments which appears to be highest, surprisingly, in the lower middle-income countries,
at 75 per cent, followed by upper-middle-income countries – at 67 per cent. Other low-income countries
received ODA solely through grants, though in far lower amounts (Figure VI-4).

2019 and 2020, the commitment from Japan doubled while that of France increased by 40 per cent.22
There are, however, differences between these countries. From Germany, 58 per cent of green ODA
took the form of grants, while the other two countries primarily gave support as debt instruments, which
represented 81 per cent and 83 per cent of Japanese and French ODA, respectively.23

In the European Union, the backbone of recovery and of the green growth strategy is the EU Green
Deal. As a proportion of total ODA, some European countries are arguing that green ODA, for both
environment and climate finance combined, should rise from 30 to 50 per cent.25 In October 2021,
the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) adopted a new approach to align development
cooperation with the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.
Only around 2 per cent of total ODA is for STI capacities, and even that proportion has been fluctuating
(Figure VI-6). The greatest growth, though from quite low values, has been for environmental and medical
research and ICT. In 2020, of total ODA targeting STI capacities, 24 per cent was for medical research
and 16 per cent went to research/scientific institutions, at $327 million, though this represents a significant
decline. Additionally, the share of ODA targeting specifically technological research and development
of total ODA for STI fell from 11 to 3 per cent in from 2000 to 2020, though increasing in absolute value
(see Figure VI-6 and Figure VI-7).

Most ODA for STI capacities comes from bilateral DAC members – United Kingdom, France, Germany,
Australia, Sweden, the Republic of Korea, the Netherlands, the United States, Canada, and Denmark
(Figure VI-9).30 Each, however, has different priorities. In 2020 most of the assistance from the United
Kingdom was medical research, while France concentrated more on environmental research, Germany
on research/scientific institutions, and Australia on agricultural research.

The priorities set for their STI support vary significantly between donors:
• The United States – Support from the largest donor is mostly aimed at research, capacity building
and innovative approaches to fight the spread of infectious and tropical diseases and prevent
maternal and child deaths.
• The United Kingdom – In 2013, the United Kingdom pledged to provide 0.7 per cent of its gross
national income (GNI) as ODA, and subsequently established new research funds for challenges
faced by developing countries – the Newton Fund, the Ross Fund, and the Global Challenges
Research Fund which also aim to allow developing countries to take advantage of the high-quality
research conducted in the United Kingdom.
• Sweden – The research co-operation programme strengthens developing countries’ research
capacity and finances research projects. The Government’s Strategy for research cooperation and
research in development cooperation 2015-2021 aims to carry out research on poverty reduction
and sustainable development, primarily in low-income countries and regions.
• Canada – International STI cooperation is primarily through the Ottawa-based International Research
Centre (IDRC), which invests in high-quality research in developing countries, shares knowledge
with researchers and policymakers for greater uptake and use, and mobilizes global alliances.
• Germany – The country has a long tradition of supporting the technical and vocational education
and training systems that can pave the way for green technologies in businesses and societies.
In addition, organizations such as the German Academic Exchange Service and Alexander von
Humboldt Stiftung provide scholarships for students from developing countries at the postgraduate
and post-doctorate levels.
Both the absolute value and the share of green ODA targeting STI capacities as a percentage of total
green ODA have been increasing but the absolute values remain low (Figure VI-10).

If developing countries are to achieve the transition to renewable energy sources and low-emission
development, they will need more ODA – an issue they are increasing raising in international negotiations.
Mongolia for example has committed to increasing its emissions reduction goal by 2030 from 22.7
to 27.2 per cent – if it receives assistance with carbon capture and storage and waste-to-energy
technologies.33 Similarly, Thailand has promised to raise its emissions reduction target from 20 to 25 per
cent – if it gets greater access to technology and more financial and capacity-building support.34

3. UNITED NATIONS SUPPORT FOR TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER
The largest public-sector funding source for transferring environmentally sound technologies (ESTs) is the
Global Environment Facility (GEF). Since 1991, financial contributions by donor countries to the several
GEF-related trust funds administered by the World Bank have amounted to over $30 billion.35 The primary
source of GEF grants is the GEF Trust Fund.36
The GEF supports innovation and technology transfer at critical early and middle stages, focusing on the
demonstration and early deployment of innovative options. Its addresses elevated risks associated with
innovation, mitigating the barriers of technology transfer and piloting promising approaches.
Since its inception, the GEF has allocated more than $22 billion in grants and blended finance, and
mobilized $120 billion in co-financing, for more than 5,000 projects in 170 countries, supplemented by
27,000 community-led initiatives through a Small Grants Programme.37
GEF is funded by donor countries and finalized its eighth replenishment in 2022, with 29 donor governments
pledging $5.33 billion for the period 2022-2026 – a fivefold increase since the first replenishment round
(Figure VI-11). The GEF 7 supported 131 projects in developing countries, with $590 million for the Climate
Change Mitigation focal area that is expected to contribute to aggregate emission reductions of more than
1,543 megatons of CO2 equivalent.38

Since GEF-5, the largest recipient countries of the GEF Trust Fund grants have been China (86 projects,
$656 million), Brazil (29 projects, $340 million), India (36 projects, $294 million), Mexico (35 projects,
$ 287 million), Indonesia (39 projects, $234 million), and South Africa (29 projects, $160 million)
(Figure VI-12). From the pilot phase to GEF7, biodiversity and climate change account for around 25 per
cent of the total GEF Trust Fund, while the corresponding share amounts to 10 per cent for international
waters, 9 per cent for chemicals and waste and 3 per cent for land degradation.39

In addition to GEF, within the United Nations System, the UNFCCC has a technology transfer framework
covering technology needs and needs assessments, technology information, enabling environments for
technology transfer, capacity-building for technology transfer, and mechanisms for technology transfer. Part
of this framework is the United Nations Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTCN), which provides
technical assistance in response to requests submitted by developing countries via their nationally-selected
focal points (Box VI-1). Upon receipt of such requests, the Centre quickly mobilizes its global Network of
climate technology experts to design and deliver a customized solution tailored to local needs.
Another United Nations framework for technology transfers is the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA)
which outlines action areas to guide global Financing for Development efforts. The AAAA established the
Technology Facilitation Mechanism (TFM) to support the SDGs by encouraging the development, adaptation,
dissemination, diffusion and transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries.
In addition, the United Nations system has several programmes to build new capabilities and skills for all
national innovation system actors to develop and deploy technologies for greener and more productive
production. International cooperation supports tailored programmes supporting countries in their
environmental management efforts, including implementing multilateral environmental agreements and
providing sustainable energy.

Box VI 1
United Nations Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTCN)
The CTCN delivers five main types of technical support on climate technologies: (1) Technical assessments, including
technical expertise and recommendations related to specific technology needs, identification of technologies,
technology barriers, technology efficiency, as well as piloting and deployment of technologies; (2) technical support for
policy and planning documents, including strategies and policies, roadmaps and action plans, regulations and legal
measures; (3) training; (4) tools and methodologies; and (5) implementation plans.
The CTCN does not provide funding directly to countries but instead supports the provision of technical assistance provided
by experts on specific climate technology sectors. Technical assistance on climate technologies is provided to developing
countries at request, free of charge (with a value up to $250,000), at local, national or regional levels, to academic, public,
NGO, or private sector entities, and for a broad range of adaptation and mitigation technologies. Technical assistance is
provided at all stages of the technology cycle: from identification of climate technology needs, policy assessment, selection
and piloting of technological solutions to assistance for technology customization and widespread deployment.

CHAPTER VI
International collaboration for more sustainable production

B. FOSTERING INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION FOR GREEN INNOVATION
International action for green innovation comes from many sources. It may be the result of businesses
seeking greater efficiency and profits, or government action or philanthropy contributing to global public
goods. Such fragmentation might be thought to hinder progress but can also be considered an advantage
in that it matches the complexity and the scale of what is needed.40
Currently, most international support for green innovation relates to specific green products such as
energy-efficient transport or fuel-saving improved cooking stoves. Much less is intended to strengthen
innovative capacities and national innovation so that developing countries can adapt and adopt green
technologies and arrive at their own solutions.

1. ALIGN TRADE WITH THE PARIS AGREEMENT
International trade should be consistent with the Paris Agreement on climate change. Trade rules should,
in particular, permit developing countries to protect infant industries so new green sectors can emerge
to build cleaner and more productive production. Historically, successful infant industry policies promote
new exports so that they cannot just meet local demand but also can reach the necessary economies
of scale and provide the proper incentives and discipline to the firms in the infant sector. Governments
in developing countries should be able to protect infant industries through selective export subsidies for
specific new sectors, local content requirements and tariffs for related imports. There should also be
direct and indirect subsidies, investment measures and government procurement that promote domestic
products over imported ones. The ability to sequence and manage these interventions is critical to avoid
the pitfalls that faced earlier industrial policies in developing countries.41
Recent initiatives in developed countries show that these policies are needed even in more technologically
advanced countries to build their technological and productive capacities in new sectors that contribute
to tackling climate change. For example, in 2022, the United States passed the Inflation Reduction Act,
which provides significant funds for climate change mitigation and adaptation, including a $7,500 tax
credit for electric vehicles assembled in the United States. 42 Moreover, by 2023, the eligibility criteria of
half of these tax credits will require 40 per cent of the minerals of the electric vehicle batteries come from
the United States or FTA partners.
While developed economies have the capabilities and economic strength to promote targeted industrial
policies for climate action, most developing countries will require the support of the international community.
The existential threat of climate change justifies all support for less technologically capable developing
countries to build these technological, innovation and productive capacities, including through targeted
industrial policies. The Paris Agreement, signed 193 member states and the EU, in articles 9, 10 and 11
enshrines this support for technology development and transfer, capacity building and required finance.43
Essential for implementing these Articles is a well-functioning trade system with effective global governance
that enables countries to address this pressing global challenge. Current trade rules, however, are not
always compatible with the infant industry policies – notably those related to export subsidies and
import restrictions. Under WTO rules, governments should design and implement policies that are nondiscriminatory among the sources of imported goods and services (most-favoured-nation principle)
and between imported and domestic goods and services (and services providers) (national treatment
principle). Subsidies should be given only for domestic production, not exports.44 In the case of agricultural
products, subsidies for domestic production are not allowed when they have a distortive effect on trade,
unless under prescribed monetary limits as provided for in national schedule (AMS) and under certain
allowance. Moreover, developing countries may face additional constraints in WTO+ rules under Regional
Trade Agreements like on IPRs.45
Previous WTO rules on subsidies used to provide some flexibility. They allowed R&D subsidies and
subsidies for regional development and environmental protection, but rules on these subsidies expired in
2000.46 Article 27 of the Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM) permitted low-income developing

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2023

121

OPENING GREEN WINDOWS
Technological opportunities for a low-carbon world

countries to implement export subsidies for a period (eight years from the date of entry into force of the
WTO Agreement, in the case of the least developed countries).47 Although developing countries can still
ask for extensions that the WTO Ministerial Conference can approve, the expiry of the initial time limit sets
the tone for a less flexible system.
Developed countries have more frequently used the dispute settlement mechanism to raise cases against
middle-income developing countries. For example, out of 301 countervailing actions initiated by the United
States between 1995 and 2021, 104 were related to measures enacted by China. Other developing
countries that cases from the United States refer to are India (39 cases), Türkiye (16), Indonesia (12), Brazil
(9) and Viet Nam (8).48 At the same time, whenever a developing country wins a case against a developed
country, its ability to use remedies or retaliate is limited because the developed country often represents a
significant export market.49 Also, the lack of financial resources prevents small developing countries from
using dispute settlement mechanisms (DSM).50
This pattern is revealed by an analysis of WTO disputes and Subsidies and Countervailing Measures
cases (Table VI-7). Developed countries have been the primary users of these mechanisms, raising almost
5 out of every 6 cases. Most cases were against other developed countries or middle-income countries.
However, no case was presented against low-income countries.51 Thus, the current trade regime
may constitute a more significant challenge for implementing infant industry policies in middle-income
developing countries, not low-income countries.

Nevertheless, the WTO has been responding to demands for more sustainable trade. In 2020, 50 WTO
members expressed their intention to collaborate, prioritize and advance trade and environmental
sustainability discussions through Trade and Environmental Sustainability Structured Discussions (TESSD)
between interested WTO Members and dialogues with external stakeholders. In December 2021, WTO
members adopted a Ministerial Statement setting out the future work of TESSD agreeing, among other
things, to “[i]ntensify [their] work on areas of common interest and to identify concrete actions that
participating Members could take individually or collectively to expand opportunities for environmentally
sustainable trade in an inclusive and transparent way, consistent with their obligations.”52

122

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2023

CHAPTER VI
International collaboration for more sustainable production

In June 2022, WTO members launched a broader reform process. The intention is to enhance negotiating
functions and restore the dispute settlement mechanism, but they could also change the rules in favour
of a green transition. In this context, member countries should consider extending the UNFCCC principle
of “common but differentiated responsibility and respective capabilities,” to trade, investment, and
intellectual property rights. This principle could be considered under the mechanism established by the
Bali Ministerial Conference to review and analyse the implementation of special and differential treatment
provisions through Dedicated Sessions of the Committee on Trade and Development.53
Efforts to align trade rules with the Paris Agreement should continue and be strengthened. Some authors
have proposed other ways to change the rules to facilitate technological upgrading in developing countries.54
For example, a rule could be created to require developed countries to meet their commitment of directing
0.7 per cent of their GDP to ODA before they are able to complain against developing countries that use
subsidies to promote specific new export sectors. Also, by bringing back the non-actionable subsidies for
R&D, regional development and environmental compliance under the now expired SCM.55
Meanwhile, countries should continue to seek to develop their infant industries in cleaner sectors under
the existing WTO rules. For example, countries with larger domestic markets can implement specific
subsidies for production for domestic consumption (since subsidies and local content requirements for
exports are prohibited). Thus, these countries could subsidize nascent cleaner sectors focusing on import
replacement; for example, for the production of components and parts of domestic solar and wind energy
projects. As this production takes root, the capacities for export could be developed with the support
of trade facilitation measures. Countries could also provide subsidies through regional development,
technological and environmental policies. For example, a policy to promote the establishment of a new
regional cluster on green technologies for cleaner production could be framed as WTO-compatible
under these rules.56 Another possible strategy to be followed by developing countries is to subsidize the
production of new cleaner sectors and use a stable and competitive exchange rate as an alternative to
tariffs. That combination would have the same effect as export subsidies for the priority targeted sectors.57
Alternatively, whenever less technologically advanced developing countries identify those rules that
prevent their greening efforts, a waiver or some allowance should be explicitly (and more easily) provided
by the WTO membership.
The international community should also be innovative and propose new and bold trade mechanisms to
support the development of innovation and technological capacity in developing countries for cleaner and
more productive production. Any such mechanism should address the supply and demand elements.
On the supply side, developed countries can use development assistance to help countries to emulate
the production of more advanced countries – to diversify their economies and produce cleaner, more
productive and competitive products. On the demand side, developed countries should open their
markets to production from latecomer economies.
A challenge that would need to be addressed in such an approach is the identification of products and
countries that would benefit from such measures. Some observers point to this identification problem
as one of the reasons for the past failure of the WTO efforts on environmental goods and services.58
Moreover, as seen in Chapter 5, it is possible to find products associated with lower carbon footprints
in all sectors and at very disaggregated levels, from primary products to manufacturing. Thus, designing
rules that identify these products is challenging, particularly if they rely on government self-assessment.
Similarly, the level of technological capacity of a country requires a sophisticated methodology to be
assessed. This suggests that a new institutional arrangement would be required at the international level
to generate the information to be used in the stipulation of trade rules.
A possible arrangement to pilot this approach would be to create an international programme of guaranteed
purchase of tradable green products that can be used for energy transition (e.g., products, parts and
components used in renewable energy projects). The programme could be set up so that to participate
in it, firms from developed and developing countries should partner in an innovation collaboration
arrangement to develop the technological and productive capacities of developing country firms. The

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2023

123

OPENING GREEN WINDOWS
Technological opportunities for a low-carbon world

programme could match the complexity of products to be purchased to the technological capacity of
the developing country, providing a reasonable “challenge” for countries to build their technological and
productive capacities. For example, only countries with low technological capacities could participate
in the programme producing the less complex products. More technologically advanced developing
countries would have to participate in producing more complex products.

2. REFORM INTERNATIONAL PROTECTION OF IPRS FOR LESS
TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED COUNTRIES
More stringent international protection of Intellectual property rights (IPRs) reduces the opportunity
for firms to reverse engineer and copy the production they try to emulate. Historically, many countries
have caught up primarily by copying existing technologies – as happened in the century after the
industrial revolution when other countries sought to emulate Britain. It was also evident from the
1960s when Asian countries such as Japan and the Republic of Korea copied from industries in
Europe and the United States.59 Only some way into the catching-up process did they increase their
levels of intellectual protection.
Emulation became more difficult as international protection of IPRs was tightened up – especially from
1994, with the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS) (Box VI-2).60
This set a much higher bar and has no provisions for differential IP regimes for countries at different
levels of technological capabilities – the special and differential treatment provisions only relate to
time lags in the implementation of the agreement, which are not linked to any objective measures of
technological or productive capacities.61 A less-stringent IPR regime at the global level (which is unlikely)
would increase the opportunities for emulation for less technologically advanced countries.62

Box VI 2
Selected elements of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual
Property Rights (TRIPS)
Flexibility and compulsory licenses
TRIPS Article 31: Where the law of a Member allows for other use of the subject matter of a patent without the
authorization of the right holder, such use may only be permitted if, before such use, the proposed user has made
efforts to obtain authorization from the right holder on reasonable commercial terms and conditions and that such
efforts have not been successful within a reasonable time. A Member may waive this requirement in case of a national
emergency or other circumstances of extreme urgency or in cases of public non-commercial use. The scope and
duration of such use shall be limited to the purpose for which it was authorized. In the case of semi-conductor
technology, it shall only be for public non-commercial use or to remedy a practice determined to be anti-competitive
after judicial or administrative process. Any such use shall be authorized predominantly for the supply of the domestic
market of the Member authorizing such use.
Transitional periods
TRIPS Article 65.2 to 5: A developing country Member was entitled to delay for a further period of four years the date
of application of the provisions of the Agreement.
TRIPS Article 66.1: Given the special needs and requirements of least-developed country Members, their economic,
financial and administrative constraints, and their need for flexibility to create a viable technological base, such
Members shall not be required to apply the provisions of this Agreement for ten years from the date of application. The
Council for TRIPS shall, upon duly motivated request by a least developed country Member, accord extensions of this
period. In June 2021, the TRIPs Council agreed to extend the LDC transition period to 1 July 2034.63
Technology transfer
TRIPS Article 66.2: Developed country Members shall provide incentives to enterprises and institutions in their
territories to promote and encourage technology transfer to least-developed country members to enable them to
create a sound and viable technological base.

Technical and financial cooperation
TRIPS Article 67: To facilitate the implementation of this Agreement, developed country Members shall provide, on
request and on mutually agreed terms and conditions, technical and financial cooperation in favour of developing
and least-developed country Members. Such cooperation shall include assistance in the preparation of laws and
regulations on the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights as well as on the prevention of their abuse,
and shall include support regarding the establishment or reinforcement of domestic offices and agencies relevant to
these matters, including the training of personnel.

TRIPS Article 66.2 does oblige developed countries to “provide incentives to enterprises and institutions
in their territories for the purpose of promoting and encouraging technology transfer to least developed
country members in order to enable them to create a sound and viable technological base.” However,
although developed countries have reported incentives to their firms and institutions to engage in
technology transfer not only to the LDCs but also, in some cases, to developing countries in general,
compliance with the Article has been low and difficult to enforce.64
Considering the imperative to tackle the existential threat of climate change, the international community
should align the international protection of IPRs with the principle of “common but differentiated
responsibility and respective capabilities” set out in the UNFCCC. Manufacturers in technologically
weak and less-diversified countries should be allowed to imitate the production of more technologically
advanced economies. 65 The international IPR system should also allow for tailored IP regimes in which
governments manage their IP systems to support climate action and their industrial and technological
development strategies, balancing IP regimes to address the needs of different sectors and different
stages of development.66
The principle that the international trade framework should place sustainable development considerations
above commercial objectives has already been demonstrated during the COVID-19 crisis. In 2022, the
12th Ministerial Conference of WTO adopted a Ministerial Decision allowing eligible Members until 2027
to produce and supply vaccines without the consent of the patent holder to the extent necessary to
address the COVID-19 pandemic. 67 Similarly, the 2022 WTO Ministerial Declaration on Response to the
COVID-19 Pandemic and Preparedness for Future Pandemics,68 recognized “the role of the multilateral
trading system in supporting the expansion and diversification of production of essential goods and
related services needed in the fight against COVID-19 and future pandemics, including through identifying
opportunities and addressing barriers.”
Similarly, countries have used existing WTO mechanisms to try to promote consistency of the trade regime
with the climate change agreements. In 2013, Ecuador, for example, proposed a series of actions to
use flexibilities in the TRIPS Agreement for environmentally-sound technologies for vulnerable developing
countries and least developed countries whose effective adoption and dissemination constitute a matter
of “public interest” due to the existential threat of climate change (Box VI-3). The proposal received a mixed
reaction; it was welcomed by some countries, while others welcomed the debate but not necessarily the
proposals.69

2013 proposals by Ecuador to adapt the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights
The 2013 proposals by Ecuador in a Communication to WTO’s Council for Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual
Property Rights were:
•

Reaffirmation of the existing flexibilities in the TRIPS Agreement so that Members use them in connection with
ESTs, for example through a declaration addressing flexibilities in the TRIPS Agreement, climate change and
access to ESTs;

•

Initiation of a review of Article 31 of the TRIPS Agreement to determine which of its provisions may excessively
restrict access to and dissemination of ESTs, and particularly its paragraph (f) and the need to include provisions
on, as the case may be, the transfer of expertise or know-how to implement compulsory licences;

•

Evaluation of the regulation of voluntary licensing and the conditions thereof from the standpoint of the most
pressing needs of the most vulnerable developing countries in relation to adaptation to and mitigation of climate
change;

•

Recognition that adaptation to and/or mitigation of the harmful effects of climate change should be assimilated
to the concept of “public interest”, with the adoption of a provision authorizing exemption from patentability, on
a case-by-case basis, for inventions whose exploitation is vital for the diffusion of ESTs needed for adaptation
and/or mitigation of climate change;

•

Evaluation of Article 33 of the TRIPS Agreement to establish a special reduction in the term of protection for a
patent of [X] years in order to facilitate free access to specific patented ESTs for adaptation and/or mitigation of
the effects of climate change because of urgent need in the public interest; and

•

Inclusion of a mechanism in the TRIPS Agreement to promote open and adaptable technology licensing for
results obtained from research into climate change and ESTs financed through public funds.

In the light of the above points, the application of new flexibilities included in the TRIPS Agreement would be understood
to be only in favour of the vulnerable developing countries and least developed countries.

3. PARTNERS FOR GREEN TECHNOLOGY
Policymakers are keen to guarantee the benefits of green transformations for national companies and
workers, and private actors who strive to protect their intellectual capital through patents and royalties. All
of which will inhibit the rapid and widespread diffusion of innovation.
International and national governance of green innovation must deal with these tensions and develop
partnerships for common public goods.71 One ground-breaking model for this philosophy is the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Others are the Paris Agreement of 2015 and the
agreements for the Sustainable Development Goals, especially SDG 17 “Partnership for the Goals”. As
nearly all governments have approved the Paris Agreement and SDGs,72 this should also be a guiding
principle for public promotion of green innovations.
There are also successful examples of collective research whose results belong to all participating countries,
particularly in natural sciences, including the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), the
International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) and the Square Kilometre Array (SKAO) project
(Box VI-4). Similar collaborations can also shape international cooperation for green innovations that
equitably incorporate the views and priorities of developing countries.73
These collaborations can still however, allow for conflicting views and diverging interests. This can be
shown by the current discussion about a global transition towards a “green hydrogen economy”. The
recent debate about the EU energy “taxonomy” made it clear that countries have different views on what
clean energy should be the basis for green hydrogen production. For Germany, the term clean energy
should be exclusively reserved for renewables such as wind and solar, while France includes nuclear
energy among clean energy sources.

126

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2023

CHAPTER VI
International collaboration for more sustainable production

Box VI 4
Examples of partnership-oriented approach to research
International Mega-Science collaborations are driven by a common goal. The founding fathers of CERN, for example,
stated that “The spirit from the beginning, was that we are not at CERN to profit; we are there to help to achieve the
common objective.”74 ITER similarly unites three continents and 35 nations under one ambition to employ fusion power
as a large-scale, carbon-free energy source to build a new Sun on earth. That spirit resonates in SKAO international
collaboration to demonstrate the scientific and technological feasibility for peaceful purposes. The knowledge obtained
is expected to benefit all humankind eventually.
The common goal and scientific spirit are embodied in mandates or mutual agreements. CERN was example,
established in 1954 as result of a Convention signed by 12 founding states in 1953.75 Today it has 23 Member States,
bringing together more than 17,500 people working to discover what the universe is made of and how it works.
The ITER Agreement was signed in Paris in 2006 and entered fully into force in 2007 after the members’ ratification.76
Similarly, seven countries signed the SKA Observatory Convention in 2019 in Rome.
To avoid undue influence from any particular member, these collaborations, have been established as intergovernmental
organizations (IGOs). For example, the ITER Organization enjoys privileges and immunities on the territories of the
seven Members. 77 Likewise, founding members of SKAO came together in Rome in 2019 for the signature of the
international treaty establishing the IGO that will oversee the delivery of the world’s largest radio telescope.78
Funding agencies from Member and Non-Member States of CERN are responsible for the financing, construction and
operation of experiments. 79 Members of ITER contribute to the project in-kind resources – components, equipment,
materials, buildings, and other goods and services and may recommend staff). But they also provide financial
contributions to the organization’s budget. 80
Today, global issues such as the energy crisis, scientific quests, climate change, and sustainable development are too
complex to be answered by one nation’s experts or facilities alone. International large-scale collaborations engender
knowledge sharing, innovation, and economic development. Successful collaborations – such as CERN, ITER, and
SKAO – leverage international talent to go beyond what can be done and discovered at smaller scales.

4. MULTILATERAL AND OPEN INNOVATION
Most global STI efforts are governed by developed countries and generally reflect their priorities – domestic
stakeholders define agendas and priorities of research, financing comes from public and private sources
in the country, and usually national companies and societal groups are prioritized.81
Countries with different levels of socio-economic development and ecological conditions will set diverse
priorities in their R&D agendas. For food security, for example, since food availability is no longer an issue
in developed countries, R&D in the agricultural sector has declined, middle-income countries have rising
populations and increasing incomes and need R&D on agriculture to further boost productivity.82 Similarly,
in energy research, the industrialized countries are primarily interested in decarbonizing grid-connected
energy systems while low-income countries in Africa and Southern Asia need easy-to-roll-out renewableenergy-fed mini-grids. And when it comes to green hydrogen, the main focus of the current debate is
on hydrogen to decarbonize the steel industry, while the developing countries might prefer to use green
hydrogen to produce ammonia as the basis for nitrogen fertilizer.
The international community can address these priority differences by shifting research for green innovation
from the national to the multinational level.83 A useful model is the Consultative Group on International
Agricultural Research (CGIAR), which is internationally financed and located mainly in developing countries
(Box VI-5). CGIAR is intensively embedded in multi-stakeholder networks and aims to produce common
goods and has contributed innovative solutions for a climate-smart, innovative and socially inclusive
agriculture. International organizations and donors could adapt the CGIAR model to other sectors.
Multilateral research can cover the whole value chain, or just a part of it. Research institutions could, for
example, bring products or processes close to technology maturity and invite private companies to take

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2023

127

OPENING GREEN WINDOWS
Technological opportunities for a low-carbon world

care of rapid deployment. Or they might only take concepts to the laboratory stage or early demonstration
projects. The aim should be to combine the strengths of multilateral and publicly funded research with the
creativity and endeavours of the private sector.
Multilateral research should be based on open innovation – with all the results available to international
experts and knowledge communities, all of whom can contribute to the best possible solutions. Many
innovators are already producing open-source designs and technologies, but there is no central repository
– which hinders access for producers in developing countries.
In this regard, the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations recently adopted resolution
2021/30 which calls for a centralized repository of open-source technical information as a global stock
of knowledge.84 Such a database would require solid support from UN Member States and agencies.
UNCTAD has been disseminating the proposals and seeking ways of implementing the resolution.85

Box VI 5
Examples of multilateral modes of research and research cooperation
Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR): CGIAR was formally launched in May 1971 by the
World Bank and 16 donors, including governments of industrialized countries and other organizations CGIAR has,
since then, become a major player for world agricultural research and a reference in terms of how scientific research
can help develop agricultural solutions for the poor.86 CGIAR is the largest global partnership focusing on “agricultural
research for development” particularly in developing countries with a vision to create a “world free of poverty,
hunger and environmental degradation”. It operates globally through its 15 research centres in close association
with “hundreds of partners, including national and regional research institutes (NARIs), civil society organizations,
academia, development organizations and the private sector”.87 CGIAR’s mandate is to contribute to regional or global
public goods and, thus, technologies and knowledge generated are in principle freely transferred of shared. 88
Global Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) Institute: When the Global CCS Institute was launched in 2009 it had 15
governments and more than 40 companies and industry groups as foundation members. By 2010 membership had
increased to 263 members, including 26 national governments. The mission of the Global CCS Institute is to accelerate
the roll-out of commercial CCS for a low-carbon future. To achieve this objective, a set of CCS demonstration projects
shall be rolled out and capacity building and knowledge sharing are crucial. The role of IPR has been intensely
discussed since the institute’s formation. While on the one hand, IP rights of partners are respected, the goals are 1)
to gather and package non-proprietary information on CCS and make it accessible to all stakeholders, 2) to make IP
generated through program activities as widely accessible to members as practical and to make IP jointly generated
by the Institute and its partners through Institute activities available in reasonable terms to other Institute activities.89
International Energy Agency (IEA) Implementing Agreements: The IEA, an intergovernmental organization, acts as an
energy policy advisor to its member countries. Through its work, IEA supports their efforts to ensure reliable, affordable
and clean energy for their citizens. The triple goals are energy security, economic development and environmental
protection.90 IEA also provides opportunities for exploring alternative energy and conservation sources through longterm cooperation. One important mode of multilateral cooperation is the IEA Implementation Agreements (IA). By IEA
rules and regulations, participation in an IA is to be based on equitable sharing of obligations, contributions, rights and
benefits. Patents resulting from work within an IA may be filed in countries as appropriate by the inventing participant.
Participants may be required not to disclose information related to these patents for a fixed period.

5. ASSESSING TECHNOLOGIES
Most technologies have both positive and negative consequences depending on the local context and
on how they are used. Artificial intelligence in agriculture, for example, can enable farmers in developing
countries to use much less fertilizer and pesticides. But if it is embedded in IT-powered robots for
harvesting fruits and vegetables AI can eliminate the jobs of agricultural workers who are often women.91
Also, how technologies are assessed regarding their opportunities and risks is often related to the
specific value systems of a society and the challenges it faces. For example, the CRISPR-CAS genome
editing technology can be used to boost agricultural yields but also raises a number of ethical issues.

128

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2023

CHAPTER VI
International collaboration for more sustainable production

A 2018 ruling by the EU court of justice made progress in genome editing technologies depending on
bureaucratic procedures and, thus, slowed down the innovation process. Therefore, a decision based
on normative considerations from one world region potentially has a significant global impact.92
Every country needs to be able to assess the benefits and dangers of each technology according to its
own needs, priorities and concerns, but to date, technologies have largely been assessed either from
the perspective of the developed countries or of emerging economies such as Brazil the Philippines or
Türkiye (Box VI-6).
What is needed however is a more general multilateral system for assessing new technologies such as AI
and gene-editing – based on the opportunities and risks they offer to different types of country.93 UNEP,
for example, through the Climate Technology Centre & Network (CTCN) conducted a Technology Needs
Assessment in Brazil on the use of Industry 4.0 technologies, particularly on how they can help create
a circular economy.94 UNCTAD is currently carrying out pilot projects involving three African countries
to build capacity for technology assessment. It could also consider how developing countries can be
systematically supported to use such technologies.

Box VI 6
Technology assessment elements in emerging economies
Brazil – The Government is assessing the country’s technological capacity through the project “Evaluation of the
Technological Needs to the Implementation of the Climate Action Plans in Brazil” (TNA Brazil). It contributes to the
national goals of mitigation of greenhouse gases, taking into consideration Brazil’s Nationally Determined Contribution
and Brazil’s strategy for the Green Climate Fund.95
Philippines – DOST-National Research Council of the Philippines (NRCP) is investigating alternative energy sources
in the Philippines through the The Clean Energy – ALERT (Alternative Energy Research Trends) programme. This
programme is expected to lay out how renewable energy can reduce government’s costs, bring jobs to the country,
create wealth, expand access to energy for the most vulnerable in poor communities, and foster national energy
independence.96
Türkiye – The Science and Technology Commission was established to anticipate the future technologies and
contribute to the country’s 2053 net zero emission target. The objective is to foresee future technologies for adaptation
and mitigation, and to enable the country to develop its R&D and innovation capacity. With a multidisciplinary holistic
approach, the Commission has held more than 40 online meetings with 97 experts from universities, the private
sector, NGOs and public institutions. The outcomes are translated into prioritized RDI topics in TÜBİTAK’s R&D, and
innovation support programmes.

6. REGIONAL AND SOUTH-SOUTH STI
Climate change is a global issue; thus, technological innovations to address this threat might increasingly
be generated on the transnational or even global level. However, this is not the case. One indicator is the
volume of financial resources spent on R&D. The European Union arguably has most ambitious regional
integration programme Horizon Europe on which predicted expenditure over the period 2014-2020 will be
about 13 billion but this pales in comparison to EU countries’ national spending. In 2020, Germany alone
invested more than €15 billion in public R&D.97
In developing countries, there is even less regional cooperation on STI for sustainable development.
Researchers and investors in the poorer countries have little incentive to work with their regional peers and
are more likely to enter research projects with developed countries and emerging economies, which can
offer access to world-class research and laboratories as well as computing power. In addition, individual
researchers, would prefer to publish in internationally refereed journals and cooperate with researchers
from well-known universities in the North.98

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2023

129

OPENING GREEN WINDOWS
Technological opportunities for a low-carbon world

This is also reflected in the level of South-South cooperation in science and technology, which remains
limited. On 15 April 2019, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution recognising the importance of
South-South cooperation to achieve the SDGs, calling for greater support to step it up.99 The document
also serves as an international framework of agreed principles covering the topic. It calls for regional
mechanisms to share and strengthen successful science, technology and innovation policies and
strategies, explore new opportunities, and promote cross-border and interregional coordination and
collaboration between initiatives and research in scientific areas.100 Moreover, there have been several
initiatives in South-South cooperation. In 2020, for example, African governments launched the 10-year
Science, Technology and Innovation Strategy for Africa (STISA-2024). But overall cooperation has been
limited, even in issues such as climate change in which countries in the same region often face similar
problems, as in the Caribbean with the rise in sea level or in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) with changing
patterns of precipitation.
The problem is partly that small and poor countries do not have sufficiently interesting home markets
to attract local or international investment in the manufacture of goods related to green innovation. To
address this issue, donor countries can support regional centres of excellence for green technologies and
innovation – such as the Southern African Science Service Centre for Climate Change and Adaptive Land
Management (SASSCAL) and the West African Science Service Centre on Climate Change and Adapted
Land Use.
For many countries the lack of South-South cooperation is being offset by the arrival of China. Between
1990 and 2018, China’s share of total imports in sub-Saharan Africa rose from 1.1 to 16.5 per cent. And
markets in China and Africa are being brought close together through the infrastructure of the Belt and
Road Initiative. Accompanied by a change in China-SSA trade patterns, shifting from imports of products
such as footwear and light manufactured to more sophisticated and capital-intensive goods, China is now
the most significant source for machines and electronics for the region.101
And compared with investment from developed countries China seems to be more effective in promoting
technological progress in Africa. 102 This could be because there are smaller technological gaps between
enterprises in China and those in Africa which eases the transfer of technology. Moreover, many Chinese
investors are very active in transferring technology-related knowledge to their staff in Africa, generally
through on-the-job training rather than classroom-type training.103 This often refers to small Chinese
companies operating in Africa’s domestic markets.
Nevertheless, the evidence for such technology transfer is limited and mixed.104 Some studies indicates
that Chinese companies are involved in more traditional styles of technology transfer, for smooth
implementation of investment projects, when it is cheaper to employ a local contractor than to fly in staff
from the home country.105
More technologically advanced developing countries should step up and strengthen efforts to promote
regional and South-South cooperation for green innovation.

7. A MULTILATERAL CHALLENGE FUND “INNOVATIONS FOR OUR COMMON
FUTURE”
Successful innovation systems create multiple incentives for companies and entrepreneurs to develop their
own ideas and transfer them to practice. Many industrialised countries use business plan competitions
or competition-based incentives for innovation. These inject dynamism to the business sectors and help
reconfigure innovation systems. However, most developing countries lack the financial or management
capacities to develop similar incentives. In addition, in the spirit of this chapter, innovation challenges
should best be implemented, not on the national level, but internationally.
This Report proposes therefore a multilateral challenge fund “Innovations for our common future.“ The
name echoes the 1987 report of the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED),
“Our Common Future”, which embraced environment and development as one single issue. Funded by

130

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2023

CHAPTER VI

international organizations donors and international philanthropy, the fund would mobilize creative thinking
and stimulate innovations that could respond to many global challenges. The governance mechanism
could be similar to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) with its own executive
committee, technical support units and with a secretariat.
The next step would be to design a global green innovation competition. It could draw, for instance, on
the international donors experienced in this area. The criteria for assessing projects would be the extent to
which they incorporate North-South and South-South and Triangular STI cooperation for green innovation.

For a significant period (1975-2017) patents were
extracted from a database of the Cooperative
Patent Classification (CPC). Green technologies
were conceptualized as comprising technologies
1) in climate change mitigation and adaptation
and 2) in systems that integrate technologies
related to power network operation and ICTs in
this area.

Technology

Description

Artificial
intelligence (AI)

AI is normally defined as the capability of a machine to engage in cognitive activities
typically performed by the human brain. AI implementations that focus on narrow tasks
are widely available today, used for example, in recommending what to buy next online,
for virtual assistants in smartphones, and for spotting spam or detecting credit card
fraud. New implementations of AI are based on machine learning and harness big data.

Internet of things
(IoT)

IoT refers to myriad Internet-enabled physical devices that are collecting and sharing
data. There is a vast number of potential applications. Typical fields include wearable
devices, smart homes, healthcare, smart cities and industrial automation.

Big data

Big data refers to datasets whose size or type is beyond the ability of traditional
database structures to capture, manage and process. Computers can thus tap into data
that has traditionally been inaccessible or unusable.

Blockchain

A blockchain refers to an immutable time-stamped series of data records supervised by
a cluster of computers not owned by any single entity. Blockchain serves as the base
technology for cryptocurrencies, enabling peer-to-peer transactions that are open,
secure and fast.

5G

5G networks are the next generation of mobile internet connectivity, offering download
speeds of around 1-10 Gbps (4G is around 100 Mbps) as well as more reliable
connections on smartphones and other devices.

3D printing

3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, produces three-dimensional objects
based on a digital file. 3D printing can create complex objects using less material than
traditional manufacturing.

Robotics

Robots are programmable machines that can carry out actions and interact with the
environment via sensors and actuators either autonomously or semi-autonomously.
They can take many forms: disaster response robots, consumer robots, industrial
robots, military/security robots and autonomous vehicles.

Drones

A drone, also known as an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) or unmanned aircraft system
(UAS), is a flying robot that can be remotely controlled or fly autonomously using software
with sensors and GPS. Drones have often been used for military purposes, but they also
have civilian uses such as in videography, agriculture and in delivery services.

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2023

CHAPTER VII
Annex A. Frontier technology trends

Gene editing

Gene editing, also known as genome editing, is a genetic engineering tool to insert,
delete or modify genomes in organisms. Potential applications include droughttolerant crops or new antibiotics.

Nanotechnology

Nanotechnology is a field of applied science and technology dealing with the
manufacturing of objects in scales smaller than 1 micrometre. Nanotechnology is
used to produce a wide range of useful products such as pharmaceuticals, commercial
polymers and protective coatings. It can also be used to design
computer chip layouts.

Solar photovoltaic
(Solar PV)

Solar photovoltaic (solar PV) technology transforms sunlight into direct current
electricity using semiconductors within PV cells. In addition to being a renewable
energy technology, solar PV can be used in off-grid energy systems, potentially
reducing electricity costs and increasing access.

Concentrated
solar power

Concentrated solar power (CSP) plants use mirrors to concentrate the sun’s rays and
produce heat for electricity generation via a conventional thermodynamic cycle. Unlike
solar photovoltaics (PV), CSP uses only the direct component of sunlight and can
provide carbon-free heat and power only in regions with high direct normal irradiance
(DNI).

Biofuels

Biofuels are liquid fuels derived from biomass, and are used as an alternative to fossil
fuel-based liquid transportation fuels such as gasoline, diesel and aviation fuels.
In 2020, biofuels accounted for 3 per cent of transport fuel demand.

Biogas and
biomass

Biogas is a mixture of methane, CO2 and small quantities of other gases produced
by anaerobic digestion of organic matter in an oxygen-free environment. Biomass is
renewable organic material that comes from trees, plants, and agricultural and urban
waste. It can be used for heating, electricity generation, and transport fuels.

Wind Energy

Wind energy is used to produce electricity using the kinetic energy created by air in
motion. This is transformed into electrical energy using wind turbines. Many parts of
the world have strong wind speeds, but the best locations for generating wind power
are sometimes remote and offshore ones.

Green Hydrogen

Green hydrogen is hydrogen generated entirely by renewable energy or from lowcarbon power. The most established technology for producing green hydrogen is water
electrolysis fuelled by renewable electricity. Compared to electricity, green hydrogen
can be stored more easily. The idea is to use excess renewable capacity from solar and
wind to power electrolysers which would utilize this energy to create hydrogen, which
can be stored as fuel in tanks.

Electric Vehicles

Electric vehicles (EVs) use one or more electric motors for propulsion. They can
be powered by a collector system, with electricity from extravehicular sources, or
autonomously by a battery. As energy-consuming technologies, EVs create new
demand for electricity that can be supplied by renewables. In addition to the benefits
of this shift, such as reducing CO2 emissions and air pollution, electric mobility also
creates significant efficiency gains and could emerge as an important source of
storage for variable sources of renewable electricity.

OPENING GREEN WINDOWS
Technological opportunities for a low-carbon world

While discussed independently in the following sections, frontier technologies are increasingly interrelated,
and they often expand each other’s functionalities. For instance, AI uses big data securely stored in the
blockchain to improve predictions using machine learning.1 An increasing number of devices connected
within an IoT network contribute to building up big data as data collection tools.2 3D printing can create
more complex items that require more data by leveraging big data and items can be printed remotely
through IoT3 with AI-enabled defect detection functions.4 Industrial robots assist 3D printing at various
production stages such as replacing a printer’s build plate, washing, curing and final finishing of additively
manufactured parts.5 5G has the potential to allow near-instantaneous response for robots by dramatically
shortening the response time.6

A. SUMMARY OF FRONTIER TECHNOLOGIES
1. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
The United States and China have traditionally driven research on AI. During the period of 2000-2021,
438,619 AI-related publications were issued. Of these, nearly half were published in three countries:
the United States (90,202), China (81,857) and the United Kingdom (29,011). The top three affiliations
were the Chinese Academy of Sciences (4,831/China), the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique
(3,295/France), and Carnegie Mellon University (2,887/United States). During this same time period (20002021), 214,365 AI-related patents were granted, the three top assignee nationalities being China (70,847),
the US (41,911), and the Republic of Korea (16,135). The top three current patent owners in 2021
were Samsung Group (3,066/Republic of Korea), Ping An Insurance Group (3,013/China), and LG Corp
(3,240/Republic of Korea).
American and Chinese companies lead AI service provision. The top AI service providers commonly
referred to include Alphabet, including their affiliates, Google and DeepMind, Amazon, Apple, IBM,
Microsoft, Alibaba, and Tencent.7 The top AI service users measured by spending on AI are the retail,
banking, and discrete manufacturing sectors.8 Prices of AI depend on applications and their requirements,
but overall the trend is for increasing affordability.9 Developing AI-based tools takes increasingly fewer
resources: between 2018 and 2022, the cost to train systems decreased by 64 per cent, while training
times improved by 94 per cent.10 For instance, a basic video/speech analysis AI platform is estimated to
cost $36,000-$56,000, an intelligent recommendation engine might cost $20,000-$35,000 and an AIdriven art generator might cost $19,000-$34,000.11
The market for AI ($65 billion in 2020) is growing rapidly. Private investment increased 103 per cent
in 2021 compared to 2020 (from $46 billion to $96.5 billion). Supply-side market growth is driven by
factors including growth in big data allowing for increased learning, improved productivity, distributed
application areas, greater availability of government funding, and advances in image and voice recognition
technologies.12 However, a shortage of AI technology experts represents a significant restraint on supply.13
Demand-side growth is primarily driven by the increasing adoption of cloud-based applications and
services and solutions that use AI to increase efficiency. Commonly cited challenges that might limit the
expansion of the AI market include cybersecurity, regulatory compliance, privacy concerns, and equity
and fairness.14
The AI labour market is thriving. One study using detailed data on online job vacancies found that demand
for AI skills has risen sharply in the United States across industries and occupations. The number of
positions seeking AI skills increased tenfold between 2010 and 2019, and four times as a proportion
of all job postings. The highest demand for AI skills was in IT occupations, followed by architecture and
engineering, scientific, and management occupations.15

2. INTERNET OF THINGS
China and the United States also lead research on IoT. Between 2000 and 2021, 139,805 IoT-related
publications were issued, led by China (28,461), India (21,188) and the United States (17,318). The three

138

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2023

CHAPTER VII
Annex A. Frontier technology trends

leading affiliations were the Chinese Academy of Sciences (1,420/China), Beijing University of Posts and
Telecommunications (1,415/China) and the Chinese Ministry of Education (1,085/China). During the same
period, 147,906 patents were assigned, with three top nationalities of recipients being China (100,958),
the Republic of Korea (17,374), and the United States (13,406). The three current leading owners in
2021 were Samsung Group (9,035/Republic of Korea), Qualcomm (2,477/United States), and State Grid
Corporation of China (1,552/China).
American companies are major IoT service providers. The top IoT service providers (IoT platformers)
commonly referred to include Accenture, TCS, IBM, EY, Capgemini, HCL and Cognizant.16 The top
sectors deploying IoT solutions include the manufacturing, home, health, and finance sectors.17 The price
of an IoT system depends on the type of application, but costs are only decreasing: the average cost
of an IoT sensor has dropped from $1.40 in 2004 to $0.38 in 2020.18 Currently, for instance, instance,
ECG monitors range between $3,000and $4,000; environmental monitoring systems are priced from
$10,000, energy management systems cost $27,000 and up, and building and home automation starts
from $50,000.19
The IoT market is already large and is expanding at a fast pace: McKinsey estimates that it will enable
$5.5 trillion to $12.6 trillion in value globally by 2030, up from $1.6 trillion in 2020.20 Supply-side growth
is driven in particular by advances in semiconductor technology which enable the development of lowercost, lightweight, and more efficient devices.21 On the demand side, growth is mainly driven by rising
demand for advanced consumer electronics in growing economies, increasing adoption of smart devices
and internet-enabled devices, the rise of tele-healthcare services, and the emergence of automation
technology in various sectors.22 However, cybersecurity risks and privacy concerns could negatively affect
market growth here as well.23
The growth of the IoT market has led to skills shortages. According to one study, the number of online job
advertisements that included “IoT” increased by 32 percent between July 2021 and April 2022.24 In 2021,
LinkedIn data suggests there were over 13,000 IoT-related job openings in the United States alone.25

3. BIG DATA
China and the United States are the front-runners of big data R&D. During the period spanning 20002021, there were 119,555 publications related to big data with three top countries being China (39,484),
the United States (23,821) and India (8,970). The three leading affiliations were the Chinese Academy of
Sciences (2,339/China), Ministry of Education China (1,186/China) and Tsinghua University (1,149/China).
Within the same period, there were 72,184 patents with top nationality of assignees being China (62,605),
the Republic of Korea (5,302) and the United States (2,031). The top three current owners were State Grid
Corp. of China (1,534/China), Ping An Insurance Group (1,189/China) and Baidu Inc. (468/China).
American companies lead the big data market. The leading providers of big-data-as-a-service measured
in terms of revenue include Amazon, Microsoft, IBM, Google, Oracle, SAP and HP.26 Top users of big
data measured by spending on big data service are banking, discrete manufacturing, and professional
services.27 The cost of a big data system varies depending on the objective. For example, the average
cost of building a data warehouse with cloud storage has been estimated at $359,951 per year, while the
average cost of building one with on-premises storage is pegged at $372,279 per year.28
The big data market is already expanding quickly, particularly in developed economies, and will continue
to add economic value as its uptake across industries drives impressive efficiency improvements.29
Supply-side growth is driven by factors including growing Internet user coverage, increasing adoption
of cloud services and solutions, and continual major growth in data production.30 However, the lack
of skilled workers represents a concurrent constraint to supply.31 Growth in demand is driven by an
increasing awareness of the efficiency-related benefits and novel solutions that big data approaches can
yield, particularly in finance, but also in other industries from electricity generation to as they use them
for risk management, demand modelling, customer service, and real-time analytics.32 However, lack of

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2023

139

OPENING GREEN WINDOWS
Technological opportunities for a low-carbon world

awareness of the benefits of big data as well as privacy and security concerns continue to somewhat
dampen market growth.
The big data industry has driven a boom in demand for data scientists. According to Glassdoor data, job
openings for data scientists have increased by 480 per cent since 2016 and 650 per cent since 2012.33
In the United States, the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts a growth rate of 36 per cent between 2021
and 2031.34 Globally, the job market for data scientists and analysts will number in the tens of millions.

4. BLOCKCHAIN
As with most of these technologies, China and the United States lead research efforts into blockchain
technology. During the 2000-2021 period, there were 27,964 publications related to blockchain, led
by China (7,014), the United States (3,906), and India (3,069). The top three affiliations were Beijing
University of Posts and Telecommunications (413/China), the Chinese Academy of Sciences (402/
China) and the Chinese Ministry of Education (271/China). During this same period, 63,767 patents
were granted, the top three assignee nationalities being China (29,088), the United States (10,591),
and the Cayman Islands (5,408). The top current owners were Advanced New Technology Co. Ltd.
(3,540/Cayman Islands), Alibaba Group Holdings (3,256/Cayman Islands) and Ant Group Co. Ltd.
(2209/China).
Top providers of blockchain (blockchain-as-a-service providers)35 service include Alibaba (China),
Amazon, IBM, Microsoft, Oracle (all United States) and SAP (Germany).36 American companies are thus
the leading blockchain service providers. The top users of blockchain by industry, measured by spending
on blockchain service, were banking, process manufacturing, and discrete manufacturing.37 Blockchain
is a feature-dependent technology, so the final price depends on the specific project requirements.
The development cost of an NFT marketplace is estimated between $50,000 to $130,000, that of a
Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is between $3,500 to $20,000, while a cryptocurrency
exchange app costs between $50,000 to $100,000.38
The blockchain market has grown particularly rapidly in the past decade and projections suggest this will
only accelerate, forecasting that the business value generated by blockchain will reach $176 billion by
2025 and $3.1 trillion by 2030.39 On the supply side, the application fields of blockchain have expanded
to include various financial transactions (online payments and credit and debit card payments) as well
as IoT, health and supply chain management.40 However, challenges relating to scalability and security,
regulatory uncertainty, and difficulties with integrating the technology within existing applications act as
potential market constraints. Demand-side growth is primarly driven by growth in online transactions,
currency digitization, secure online payment gateways, and growing interest from the banking, financial
services and insurance sector alongside businesses’ increasing acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a
means of payment.41
The blockchain job market is growing rapidly. Global demand for blockchain developers is estimated
to have increased by between 300 and 500 per cent in 2021, driven by hiring from the five biggest
blockchain employers: Deloitte, IBM, Accenture, Cisco, and Collins Aerospace.42 Blockchain developers
continue to be well remunerated, with median annual incomes of $136,000 in the US, $87,500 in Asia,
and $73,300 in Europe.

5. 5G
China and the United States also lead 5G research. During the period 2000-2021, 13,045 publications
related to 5G were issued, led by China (3,236), the United States (1,446) and India (1,224). The top
affiliations were Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (402/China), Nokia Bell Labs (225/
United States) and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (179/China). During the
same period, 32,412 patents were granted, with the top assignee nationalities being China (15,869), the

140

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2023

CHAPTER VII
Annex A. Frontier technology trends

Republic of Korea (12,646), and the United States (1,858). The top current owners are Samsung Group
(11,920/Republic of Korea), Huawei (1000/China) and LG Corp. (744/Republic of Korea).
The leading vendors of end-to-end 5G network infrastructure include Ericsson, Huawei, Nokia,
ZTE, Samsung, and NEC.43 Certain industries are expected to be particularly heavy users and major
beneficiaries of the 5G rollout. These include mobile operators and network providers, machinery and
industrial automation companies, component and module vendors, and manufacturing businesses.44 5G
mobile line prices vary depending on the carrier and features. However, costs remain high: the monthly
cost of a single line of service with unlimited access to the 5G nationwide network in the US starts at $70
for Verizon, $65 for AT&T, and $60 for T-Mobile.45 The leading early adopters of 5G technologies are China,
Republic of Korea, the United Kingdom, Germany, the United States, Switzerland, and Finland.46
PwC estimates 5G’s economic impact in 2022 to be $150bn and projects that it will reach $1.3 trillion by
2030.47
The rollout of 5G will take time, approximately five years to achieve broad coverage. It is already
widespread though, with Ericsson predicting one billion subscriptions by the end of 2022 and
4.4 billion by 2027.48 Projections based on current trajectories predict that it will generate $7 trillion
of economic value by 2030.49 One constraint is introduced by the necessity of upgrading 5G
infrastructure, notably microcell towers and base stations as the high costs associated with upgrades
impede wide diffusion.50 In terms of demand, growth is mainly driven by rising demand for mobile
broadband, the growing use of smartphones and smart wearable devices, surging demand for mobile
video, rapid developments in IoT and an ever-growing number of connected devices, initiatives in
multiple countries towards the development of smart cities, and the shift in consumer preference from
premise-based to cloud-based solutions.51
5G adoption is set to create large opportunities in the job market. It is estimated that in the US
alone in 2034, 4.6 million 5G-related jobs will be created, driven largely by employment in the
following sectors: agriculture, construction, utilities, manufacturing, transportation and warehousing,
education, healthcare, and government.52 By 2035, the global 5G value chain is expected to support
22 million jobs globally.53

6. 3D PRINTING
The story with 3D printing is similar, with the United States and China driving research. During the
period 2000-2021 period, 36,367 publications related to 3D printing were made available, led by
the United States (8,896), China (7,515), and the United Kingdom (2,586). The top affiliations were
the Chinese Ministry of Education (631/China), the Chinese Academy of Sciences (571/China),
and Nanyang Technological University (491/Singapore). Within the same period, there 70,799 new
patents were assigned, with assignees’ nationalities dominated by China (42,691), the United States
(9,069), and Germany (4,705). The top patent owners in 2022 were Hewlett-Packard (1,632/United
States), Xi’an Jiaotong University (563/China) and Beijing University of Technology (559/China).
The largest 3D printing companies include Stratasys, 3D Systems, Materialise NV, EOS GmbH and
General Electric.54 Top users by sector, measured by spending on 3D printing technology, were
discrete manufacturing, healthcare and education. 55 The cost of 3D printing has dropped markedly
in the recent years and are expected to continue to do so. 56 Currently, an entry-level 3D printer can
cost as low as $100, while an industrial 3D printer starts at $10,000.57
The 3D printing market has been growing at a fast pace. Globally, it was valued at $12 billion in
2020, expected to rise to $51 billion by 2030. 58 Supply-side growth is mainly driven by increasing
variety in the materials that can be 3D printed (major shift from plastic to metal), increases in the
production speed, increases in the size of printable objects, reduction of errors, decreases in
development costs and time, the ability to build customized products, and government spending
on 3D printing projects.59 However, the still relatively high cost of 3D printing when compared to

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2023

141

OPENING GREEN WINDOWS
Technological opportunities for a low-carbon world

many products’ traditional methods of production, combined with the scarcity of skilled labourers,
may hamper the market growth. This has however not prevented demand-side growth, driven by
an increase in applications in healthcare, consumer electronics, automotive, dental, food, fashion,
and jewelry.60
The 3D printing industry’s demand for labour is increasing as its rapidly growing market requires more
skilled professionals. It is estimated that the industry will create 1.7-2.8 million new jobs in 3D-printingenabled manufacturing in the United States, and between 3 and 5 million new skilled jobs in total.
Auxiliary jobs are also increasingly sought after, with the industry needing engineers, software developers,
material scientists, and a wide range of business support functions including sales, marketing and other
specialists.61

7. ROBOTICS
Robotics research is led by the United States. Among the 276,027 publications related to robotics
published in 2000-2021, the United States (69,909), China (38,494) and Japan (20,527) led the way. Top
affiliations were the Chinese Academy of Sciences (3,676/China), Harbin Institute of Technology (2,568/
China) and Carnegie Mellon University (2,484/United States). During the same period, 122,940 patents
were granted, with most assignees coming from the United States (48,164), followed by China (27,502)
and Germany (5,205). The top three patent owners as of 2022 are Johnson & Johnson (3,438/United
States), Intuitive Surgical Inc. (3,383/United States) and Medtronic Inc. (1,834/United States).
Manufacturers from a diverse collection of countries are dominate robotics sales and production. The
four largest industrial robotics manufacturers are ABB (Switzerland), Fanuc (Japan), KUKA (Germany) and
Yaskawa (Japan), while the largest autonomous vehicle manufacturers include Alphabet/Waymo (United
States), Aptiv (Ireland), GM (United States), and Tesla (United States).62 The top industry spenders on
robotics were discrete manufacturing, process manufacturing and resource industries.63 There are many
types of robots and price depends on the type.
As the costs of production in robotics have decreased (e.g., through increasing production in lower-cost
regions, lower R&D costs, and economies of scale) prices have followed: there has been a more than 50%
drop in average robotics costs since 1990.64 This increased affordability, combined with greater volumes
of production, is in turn driving a democratising increase in market size.
The current estimate of job growth in robotics is modest in comparison to some of these other technologies,
in part because in many economies it is already further developed than they are. In the United States, for
instance, there were 167,100 active robotics engineers in 2022 with the robotics engineer job market
is expected to grow by between 1 and 5 per cent between 2020 and 2030.65 Robotics careers include
robotics engineers, software developers, technicians, sales engineers, and operators.66

8. DRONE TECHNOLOGY
The United States and Canada drive research into drone technology. During the period of 2000-2021,
the biggest contributing countries to the 23,526 publications on drone technology were the United States
(5,047), China (3,028), and the United Kingdom (1,411). The top affiliations were the Centre National
de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) (220/France), the Chinese Academy of Sciences (220/China) and
Beihang University (151/China). During the same period, there were 48,613 patents assigned worldwide,
dominated by China (22,209), the United States (7,791), and the Republic of Korea (6,318). The top
three current owners of patents in 2022 were SZ DJI Technology Co. Ltd. (1,705/China), Qualcomm
(891/United States) and LG Corp. (704/Republic of Korea).
American manufacturers are dominant in the military drone space while the commercial drone space
is more diverse, though Chinese companies play an outsized role. Companies commonly referred to
as top manufacturers of commercial drones are 3D Robotics (United States), DJI Innovations (China),
Parrot (France), and Yuneec (China), while military drone makers include Boeing (United States), Lockheed

142

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2023

CHAPTER VII
Annex A. Frontier technology trends

Martin (United States), and Northrop Grumman Corporation (United States).67 Top industries measured by
spending on drone technology were the utility, construction, and discrete manufacturing sectors.68 The
price of commercial (non-amateur) drones begins at $2000 per unit, while military drones range in price
from $800,000 to $400 million per unit.69
The commercial drone market, which has already experienced significant growth, is set to continue
expanding. In the US market alone, the industry grew from around $40 million in 2012 to around $1 billion
in 2017 and is expected to have an annual impact of $31 to $46 billion on the country’s GDP.70 The
industry with the largest potential market for commercial applications of drone technology is infrastructure,
with an estimated addressable market value of $45.2 billion.71 Digitization and technological improvement
in cameras, drone specifications, mapping software, multidimensional mapping, and sensory applications
are driving growth. However, health and safety, privacy and national security regulations are expected to
negatively affect the market while satellite imagery, though expensive, represents a competing industry
that might impede market growth, particularly as satellite services do not share the same regulatory
issues. On the demand side, increasing demand for GIS, LiDAR, and mapping services from sectors
including agriculture, energy, tourism, construction, mapping and surveying, and emergency services are
contributing to growth.72
As the drone industry grows, so does its job market. In Australia, drones are expected to support 5,500
full-time job equivalents on average per annum between 2020-2040.73 In 2020, a year marked by
economic uncertainty and job losses, drone companies reversed the trend, increasing their labour force
by an average of 15%.74

9. GENE EDITING

Therapeutics (United States), Precision BioSciences (United States), and Sangamo Therapeutics
(United States).75 Gene editing is used by pharma-biotech companies, academic institutes and
research centres, agrigenomic companies, and contract research organizations.76 The price of gene
editing varies by technology and application. The cost of human gene therapies addressing genetic
medical conditions currently ranges from $373,000 to $2.1 million but can cost as much as $5 billion
to develop.77
The gene editing market is growing but some concerns persist. Supply remains driven by large funding
for research and development and technological improvement in genetic engineering technologies.78
On the demand side, the market is driven by increasing cases of genetic and infectious diseases,
the food industry’s increasing focus on genetically modified technologies, and increasing demand for
synthetic genes. However, ethical issues concerning the misuse of gene editing as well as its potential
effect on human health may dampen growth.79
Labour demand in gene editing is expected to soar with the gene editing market’s expected growth
from $5.20 billion in 2020 to $18.50 billion in 2028. In the United Kingdom, it has been estimated
that 18,000 new jobs will be added between 2017-2035, while in the United States, 22,500 new
medical scientist and biomedical engineer jobs are expected to be added between 2021 and
2031.80

State Grid Corp. of China (290/China), Tianjin University (152/China), and Wuxi Tongchun New Energy
Tech (139/China).
Top solar panel manufacturers include Jinko Solar (China), Canadian Solar (Canada), Trina Solar (China)
First Solar (United States), SunPower (United States), and Hanwha Q CELLS (Republic of Korea).86 The
biggest users of solar PV technology include the residential, commercial and utilities sectors.87 The
prices of solar PV panels have decreased significantly, the average upfront cost for commonly used
residential PV systems (6kW) dropped from $50,000 to the range of $16,200- $21,420 in ten years
between 2008 and 2018, while the national average cost of a residential PV system in the United States
is now estimated at $2.94 per watt.88
The concentrated solar power market size is set to continue expanding. The IEA recorded a negative
impact of COVID-19 due to the pandemic hampering construction efforts. However, they project an
overall increase in global implementation of the technology from 2023 to 2025 onwards, with a push
for worldwide economic recovery encouraging increased installation of both private and commercialpurpose PV systems, with potential for an approximate 165 GW rise in per annum capacity overall.89
Solar is widely acknowledged as key to efforts to combat climate change. Chinese estimates have
projected that if solar photovaltic energy was installed in the remaining construction area available for it
in the country (estimated at approximately 6.4 billion metres squared), it would generate 1.55 times the
territory’s annual electricity usage per year.90

Annex A. Frontier technology trends

Solar PV is the largest employer among the different renewable energy industries, already accounting for
close to 4 million jobs worldwide.91 In the United States, the industry has experienced an average annual
growth rate of 33% in the last decade alone.92 The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA)
estimates that around 15.4 million people will be employed in solar PV under the 1.5°C Scenario.93

12. CONCENTRATED SOLAR POWER
Concentrated solar power research is led by the United States. Across 2000-2021, the
3,195 publications related to concentrated solar power came out of the United States (595), Spain
(484), and China (389). The top affiliations were the German Aerospace Center (131/Germany),
University of Seville (72/Spain), and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) (68/

and BrightSource Energy (United States). Concentrated solar power serves industrial, commercial and
residential sectors.94 The global weighted-average cost of electricity for concentrated solar power was
estimated at $ 0.108/kWh in 2020.95
On the supply-side, growth in the market is driven by government support for the adoption of
renewables, the integration of concentrated solar power into hybrid power plants, and advancements
in heat transfer technology such as proppants, high-temperature salts, and CO2 along with a growing
ability to minimize light reflection through new coatings for receivers.96 On the demand-side, market
expansion is driven by concentrated solar power plants’ ability to supply power on-demand rather than
being weather dependent. However, there remain concerns in terms of high capital costs, limited supply
of land mass in high solar radiation zones, limited access to water resources, and challenges with the
accessibility of transmission grids.
Worldwide, the concentrated solar power industry has created an estimated 32,000 jobs to-date.97 Jobs
in the concentrated solar power space are set to grow with IRENA and the ILO predicting 1.6 million
concentrated solar power jobs to have been created by 2050.98

13. BIOFUELS
Biofuels research is led by the United States. During the period 2000-2021, biofuels publications
numbered 74,801, originating in large part from the United States (18,386), China (10,085), and
India (6,896). The top affiliations were the Chinese Academy of Sciences (1,626/China), the Chinese
Ministry of Education (1,225/China), and the University of São Paulo (847/Brazil). Within the same
period, 22,325 patents were granted, largely to beneficiaries from the United States (6,988), China
(3,798), and France (1,083). The three largest patent owners were Royal Dutch Shell (560/United
Kingdom), Bayer AG (470/Germany) and BASF SE (339/Germany).
Leading biofuel production companies include Cosan (Brazil), Verbio (Germany), ALTEN Group
(France), Archer Daniels Midland Co. (United States), Argent Energy UK Ltd. (United Kingdom),
REG (United States), Cargill Inc. (United States), Louis Dreyfus (France), and Wilmar International
Ltd (Singapore). The main users of biofuels are the transportation, heating and electricity generation
sectors.99 The cost of biofuel production depends on methods used. In 2020, the average production
cost of biofuels made using cellulosic ethanol was $4 per gallon-gasoline equivalent (gge).
Biofuels produced using the pyrolysis-biocrude-hydro treatment pathway had a cost estimate of
$3.25/gge, biofuels produced using biomass to liquid (BTL) had an average cost of $3.80/gge,
while hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA) biofuels were estimated to have an average cost
of $3.70/gge.100

OPENING GREEN WINDOWS
Technological opportunities for a low-carbon world

The global biofuels market is projected to expand rapidly: the IEA estimates that demand for biofuels will
most likely grow by 41 billion litres, or 28 per cent, over the period 2021-2026.101 The market is currently
driven by demand-side factors as national policies such as obligatory blending take effect and national
ambitions for energy security increase, the latter having been amplified by the conflict in Ukraine and the
2022 global energy crisis. Growing demand for fuel in the transportation sector and moves to transition
to a low-carbon economy also contribute significantly. On the supply-side, preferential taxes, subsidies
and mandates have driven biofuel prices lower and helped increase production.102 However, the key
challenge to biofuels is their continued low cost-competitiveness relative to fossil fuels. Furthermore,
biofuel feedstock production may cause changes to land use patterns, place strain on water supply,
generate air and water pollution, and increase food costs.103
Worldwide, the liquid biofuel market employs an estimated 2,411,000 people.104 Although biofuel jobs
declined between 4 and 5 per cent in the United States in 2020 due to knock-on effects from the
Covid-19 pandemic, declines in biofuel employment were less severe than those in the job markets for
other kinds of fuels. Biofuel employment is projected to rebound, accompanying the gradual recovery
from the pandemic.105

14. BIOGAS AND BIOMASS
Biogas and biomass research is led by China and the United States. Between 2000 and 2021, 400,062
biofuel-related publications were put out, led by China (79,658), the United States (77,614), and India
(27,183). The top affiliations were the Chinese Academy of Sciences (17,175/China), the Chinese Ministry
of Education (8,554/China), and the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (6,245/China). Within
the same period, the 251,251 registered patents were assigned primarily to residents of China (99,328),
the United States (38,856), and France (13,713). The three top patent owners in 2022 were Xyleco (3,808/
United States), BASF SE (2,694/Germany), and Evonik Industry AG (1,694/Germany).
Major biogas and biomass producers include Future Biogas (United Kingdom), Air Liquide (France), PlanET
Biogas Global (Germany), Ameresco (United States), Quantum Green (India), Envitech Biogas (Germany),
and Weltec Biopower (Germany). The main users of biogas and biomass are the industrial, transportation,
residential and electric power generation sectors.106 The cost of producing biogas varies between
$2/MBtu to $20/MBtu.107 Biomass power plants generate electricity that generally costs around
$0.030 and $0.140/kWh; but certain projects can cost up to $0.250/kWh.108
The global biogas markets is projected to grow rapidly, while the biomass market is expected to undergo
transformation as it transitions from traditional to sustainable methods. While biomass constitutes 9 per
cent of the world’s energy production, biogas represents only a 0.3 per cent share of total primary energy.
Despite this, the IEA projects significant growth for sustainable forms of both, driven by their flexibility,
simplicity, and ecological necessity. The transition towards a low-carbon economy, growing demand from
power generation companies, and the adoption of biomass in fuel cell technology. On the supply-side,
biomass costs are dropping due to favorable government policies including loans for the establishment of
biomass power plants while the availability of sustainable feedstocks for biogas purposes is set to grow by
40 per cent over the period to 2040.109 However, the market is limited by challenges which include scarce
land areas for energy-growing crops and technical hurdles that limit the commercial feasibility of biomass
as a replacement for fossil fuels at higher blending rates when compared to coal.110
The biomass and biogas job markets are anticipated to keep growing. Solid biomass employs an estimated
765,000 individuals worldwide, while biogas employs approximate 339,000 people.111 It is estimated that
biomass production creates 73 permanent full-time direct jobs per 100MW of installation capacity.112

15. WIND ENERGY
Wind energy research is again led by China and the United States. 2000-2021 saw 37,514 publications
related to wind energy, led by China (5,376), the United States (5,359) and India (4,254). The top affiliations

146

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2023

CHAPTER VII
Annex A. Frontier technology trends

were the Technical University of Denmark (545/Denmark), North China Electric Power University (364/
China), and Delft University of Technology (359/Netherlands). Within the same period, 58,134 patents
were assigned, mainly to applicants from China (32,991), Germany (11,630), and the US (2927). The top
three current owners are Wobben Properties GMBH (3062/Germany), Wobben Aloys (1966/Germany),
and Senvion SE (1884/Germany).
The companies frequently cited as leading in the wind energy space include Vestas (Denmark), Siemens
Gamesa (Spain), Goldwind (China), GE (United States), and Envision (China) (BizVibe, 2022). The major
users of wind energy include the agricultural, residential, utility and industrial sectors (Hartman, 2021). The
global weighted-average cost of electricity of new onshore and offshore wind farms was $ 0.053/kWh and
$ 0.115/kWh respectively in 2019.113
The global wind energy market continues to grow as installation and maintenance costs decrease.
In 2021, wind electricity generation increased by a record 273 TWh (up 17 per cent compared to 2020),
making it the fastest growing of all power generation technologies.114 Given the increasing affordability
and profitability of wind and the large number of high-wind areas that have not yet been exploited for it,
potential for growth is strong. Demand-side drivers of growth in the wind energy market include increasing
demand for renewable energy sources and continually growing energy consumption globally. With energy
prices increasing significantly, demand for increasingly cost-effective renewable energy is growing.115 On
the supply-side, offshore wind farms have circumvented challenges related to sea depth while benefitting
from high wind speeds. Barriers in the wind energy sector include technological ones related to grid
connection and integration and the lack of supporting infrastructure. There are also economic challenges,
notably the high initial cost of capital and long payback periods, shortages in financing channels, immature
offshore supply chains, and outdated regulatory frameworks.116
The wind energy job market, already significant, currently employing 1.25 million people worldwide, is
expected to experience rapid growth.117 3.3 million new jobs are expected to be created as a result of the
additional 470GW of wind capacity expected to be installed by 2025.118

16. GREEN HYDROGEN
Green hydrogen research is led by China. Across 2000-2021, 802 green hydrogen publications were
issued, led by China (140), Germany (100), and the United States (74). The top affiliations were the Chinese
Academy of Sciences (22/China), the University of Birmingham (13/United Kingdom), and the Chinese
Ministry of Education (12/China). Within the same period, 58 patents were assigned, predominantly to
applicants from China (30), the United Kingdom (5), the US (4) and Australia (4). The three top current
owners are Anglo-American Corp. (4/UK), Xi’an Thermal Power Research Institute (4/China), and Johnson
Matthey (3/UK).
Major green hydrogen companies include Air Liquide (France), Air Products and Chemicals, Inc (United
States), Engie (France), Green Hydrogen Systems (Denmark), Siemens Energy Global GmbH (Germany),
Toshiba (Japan), and Tianjin Mainland Hydrogen Equipment Co. Ltd (China).119 The largest users of green
hydrogen include heavy industry and the transportation, heating and power generation sectors.120 Green
hydrogen costs remain high, currently estimated at around 2.5-6 USD/kg H2.121
Demand in the global hydrogen market is growing because of the need for increased flexibility and
dispatchability of renewable power systems, green hydrogen’s broad potential use across the entire
economy, and several countries with large renewable resources seeking to become net exporters. On
the supply-side, the market is flourishing courtesy of technological improvement and market-readiness of
several items in the hydrogen value chain.122
However, several barriers remain significant. Green hydrogen has higher production costs relative to grey
hydrogen even when carbon pricing increases the costs of competing fossil fuels. Significantly, there
remains a shortage of dedicated infrastructure for the transport and storage of green hydrogen, a still-

small market for it, and difficulties in drawing clear distinctions between grey and green hydrogen in
national energy statistics. Challenges also remain concerning the measurement of its sustainability.123
Green hydrogen is estimated to create as many as 2 million jobs between 2030 to 2050 as investments
in electrolyzers and other green hydrogen infrastructure increase and as it becomes increasingly widely
adopted as a fuel source.124

17. ELECTRIC VEHICLES
Electric vehicle research is led by China, the United States, Germany, and South Korea. From 2000 to
2021, of the 79,732 publications related to electric vehicles, most came from China (22,375), followed
by the United States (13,108), and Germany (5,408). The top affiliations were the Beijing Institute of
Technology (1,814/China), Tsinghua University (1,685), and Tongji University (900/China). Within the same
period, of the 206,049 patents assigned, most went to China (94,124), the Republic of Korea (23,193),
and the US (19,059). The top three current owners are LG Corp (7181/Republic of Korea), Toyota Group
(6945/Japan), and Hyundai Motor Group (6817/Republic of Korea).
Leading electric vehicle manufacturers include Tesla (United States), Renault–Nissan–Mitsubishi Alliance
(France/Japan), Volkswagen (Germany), BYD (China), Kia and Hyundai (Republic of Korea).125 The major
users of electric vehicles include the transportation, e-commerce and delivery industries.126 Between 2021
and 2022, supply chain problems and component shortages have in fact raised the average cost of a
new electric car in the United States by 22 per cent, to $54,000 (compared to a 14 per cent increase for
internal combustion engine cars).127
Nearly 10 per cent of global car sales were electric in 2021, four times the market share in 2019. This rate of
growth is projected to continue or accelerate. Demand is being driven by supportive government policy in
the form of fuel economy and emission targets, city access restrictions, and financial incentives, along with
growing corporate and consumer interest in purchasing electric vehicles to meet sustainability objectives.
128
On the supply-side, technological innovations have improved the driving range, cost competitiveness,
and time required to charge for many electric vehicles. Crucially, charging infrastructure is becoming more
widespread and accessible, and automotive manufacturers have made ambitious strategic commitments
to promote electric vehicle production and consumption.129 Further impetus comes from the growing
success of Chinese manufacturers’ focus on producing small EVs at much lower price points: in 2021,
the sales-weighted median price of EVs in China was only 10% more than that of conventional offerings,
compared with 45-50% on average in other major markets.130
However, barriers remain including concerns about electric vehicles’ range, high battery prices, a shortage
of charging infrastructure in certain countries, and concerns about the environmental harms of electric
vehicle charging and battery production.131
Electrifying the transportation industry is expected to support job growth. It is estimated that nearly
200,000 additional permanent jobs will be created in Europe by 2030 as result of employment in ten
sectors: battery manufacturing, charger manufacturing, wholesales, installation of the chargers, grid
connection, grid reinforcement, civil and road work, charge point operation, charge point maintenance
and electricity generation.132 It is likewise expected that more than the transition to electric transport will
lead to a net global net global increase of 2 million jobs despite losses the combustion engine sector.
While there might be job losses in the auto repair and maintenance industries, these would be offset by
gains in economy-wide induced jobs and increased power sector jobs.133

3. MARKET SIZE
Market size data, as measured by the revenue generated in the market, is based on various market
research reports available online. Since each market research report yields somewhat different numbers,
the market size data was collected so that the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) was the largest.
Also, the number of years between the base year and the prediction year used to calculate the CAGR
varies by technology, ranging from six to nine years.

4. FRONTIER TECHNOLOGY PROVIDERS
Since there was no structured, reliable information about market share or company profit readily available
for frontier technologies, the top frontier technology providers were identified through an online search,
listing companies most commonly referred to as top providers. The number of companies listed is not
the same across the 11 frontier technologies because there is no effective way to narrow down the
list to the same number for each technology. Moreover, the online search was conducted in English,
potentially leading to more favourable results for companies from English-speaking countries. Therefore,

After these procedures, a principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted, mainly because of its
advantage to remove correlated features among indicators and reduce overfitting. Based on the variance
explained criteria method, PCA found that three principal components could retain more than 80 per cent
of the variation. Thus, the final index was derived by assigning the weights generated by PCA with rotation
to the three principal components, and then standardized and normalized to fall within the range of
0 to 1 (Table 8).

Separately, PCA was also performed on each building block of the index to derive the score and country
ranking within each building block. Here again, PCA used the minimum number of principal components
that could retain more than 80 per cent of the variation. PCA was not conducted for the access to finance
building block as it contained only one indicator.

In 2020 China was the leading country in bioenergy production after a very rapid catch-up of the
Chinese biomass industry, with an increase of the total installed capacity from almost zero in 2005 to
around 5,300 MW in 2015, compared with, for instance, a capacity of 7,600 MW in Germany.1 The
take-off of the biomass industry is explained by the introduction in 2006 of the first renewable energy
law in China, which included a favourable feed-in tariff for biomass power which was approximately
double the coal tariff and therefore provided strong incentives for investments in biomass power plants.
These institutional changes in the energy sector clearly define an endogenous window of opportunity.
Representatives of the leading pioneer company in the industry influenced and directly contributed to
drafting the initial policies and regulations instrumental to the sector’s further development.
In the Chinese biomass industry, the build-up of production, and later of innovative capabilities, was started
by one leading private company established in Beijing in 2004 by a Chinese-Swedish entrepreneur with
experience as a senior adviser for Volvo. The company has managed to catch up with industry incumbents,
initially through licensing foreign technologies and strategic acquisitions of foreign companies, enabling
access to skilled labour. More recently, the company followed a strategy of rapid international expansion
and diversification into new technologies such as waste-to-energy plants2 and bioethanol production.3
Moreover, thanks to knowledge spillover, which consisted of labour mobility towards local competitors and
interactions with local suppliers, many domestic firms could take advantage of the window of opportunity,
creating a dynamic sectoral system. Due to the dominance of the DUI (doing-using-interacting) mode
of learning in this industry, labour turnover with high employee mobility from the leading company to
the competitors played a role as a key channel for knowledge transfer. Moreover, the design institutes,
which are State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) responsible for the design of plants, also benefitted from onsite training, careful quality supervision, and continuous interaction with the leading pioneer company,
contributing to diffusion of knowledge in the domestic sectoral system. Finally, demonstration effects are
also important because local firms have been able to copy and imitate, thanks to the weak protection
enforced on the patenting activity of the leading firm. Domestic competitors could copy components
officially protected by patents due to weak enforcement of intellectual property laws.
Following a trajectory from domestic imitation to global leadership, the Chinese biomass industry
has been able to progress from new-to-the-country technology to world-class technology and
technological upgrading was achieved faster than global market success. Chinese firms also operate
globally and have acquired global market leadership at the expense of western producers.

Thailand
In biogas, Thailand is one of the largest producers in the world, with the largest domestic market in
the Global South after China and Türkiye.4 Thailand offers another interesting example of a policy-led
window of opportunity. Since the 1980s, anaerobic wastewater treatment has been developed to
produce biogas in cassava starch factories. Still, in the beginning, most factories were not interested
in investing in biogas production due to high investment costs. However, in the early-2000s, this
changed radically when the Thai Government introduced a proactive strategy to attract private
investors to the industry. In the following years, it introduced several measures, including financial

subsidies for the construction and design of biogas production plants, tax incentives for firms involved
in waste transformation, the Small Power Purchase Tariff program for increasing the proportion of
electricity generation from biogas and the enforcement of an environmental law taxing companies
producing pollution.5
The development of a strong sectoral system is also one of the key factors in the success of the
biogas industry in Thailand. The existence of a network of private and public actors has helped to
disseminate biogas technology. The domestic research sector has developed various more efficient
and less expensive technologies than imported ones. Some technological solutions designed in
Thailand have also been adopted abroad, as in the case of the UN project Cows to Kilowatts in
Nigeria.6 Thanks to extensive training programmes, mainly conducted through public institutions such
as research centres and universities,7 domestic capability has been built in the setup and maintenance
of the production systems. This has created in the private sector the confidence that, in case of
problems, a network of public and private consultants could provide adequate technical support.8
Thai biogas companies started from relatively low levels of capabilities, and from 1991 to 2017, they have
all transitioned to higher levels.9 At the same time, the Thai biogas industry has built up an innovative
domestic capacity able to satisfy a relatively large domestic market. Moreover, they confirm that
experience-based (DUI) learning in this industry is important because of the nature of biogas systems
that require adaptation to the local contexts. The relevance of external knowledge is also stressed
because firms relying only on firm-internal learning mechanisms exhibit low capability levels. In contrast,
firms involved in external domestic and external foreign sources of knowledge have reached a higher
level of innovative capacities. A further interesting finding is that for building capabilities, firms need
to engage in different learning mechanisms – firm-internal, external-domestic, and external-foreign –
involving various types of activities – productivity-driven, innovation-driven and human-resource-related.

Pakistan
Differently from the Chinese and Thai cases, in Pakistan, the existence since 2009 of a Biogas Program to
promote an efficient replacement of traditional wood fuel and animal manure for domestic use of cooking and
heating in rural areas has not generated an extensive adoption of biogas technology. Lack of coordinated
government initiatives, regulations and construction standards for biogas plants, and inconsistent policies
have hindered the programme’s effectiveness.10 Biogas technology has vast potential in the country to create
jobs and generate income. However, there is still a lack of technical competencies. Very little has been done
to persuade farmers, sugar mill owners, and private investors to adopt and invest in biogas technology in
the country.

Mexico
Similarly, challenges are seen in the case of the palm oil industry in the Mexican state of Tabasco.11 Weak
regulations and public policies, lack of competent providers and absence of capability-building efforts
to adapt imported technologies have not allowed the state to take advantage of the market opportunity
deriving from the valorization of the variety of biomass resources from harvest and agro-industrial residues
available in the country. Moreover, the increasing production and the lack of proper management of
solid by-products generate a growing impact on the environment with residues left on the ground or
openly burned. In contrast, they could be transformed into energy within a proper management system,
establishing a sustainable palm oil industry.

Viet Nam
Similar to China and Thailand, Viet Nam has started to exploit its great potential to generate biomass
energy from rice husks – a by-product of rice processing that is otherwise often wasted. One example of
public-private collaboration is with Decathlon, whose many suppliers operate in Viet Nam, which has set
an ambitious target to use 100 per cent biomass for industrial heat and power by 2030. In collaboration
with GIZ, Viet Nam has started a project to support the development of a sustainable market in the

biomass industry and build capability among consultants, project developers, and investors on how to
draw up feasibility studies. The project also promotes technology partnerships between national and
international companies and research and development institutions to develop locally adapted solutions.12

Bangladesh
The case of biogas production in Bangladesh is also interesting because it shows that despite the existence of
favourable preconditions for the development of the industry, the lack of policies and their weak implementation,
as well as the lack of infrastructure hinder large-scale production and have diminished the capacity of the country
to exploit the potential windows opportunity.13 In this country, several NGOs have invested in biogas projects
decades ago. The country has also established an articulated system of government and non-government
organizations involved in R&D projects related to biomass energy. Nevertheless, a proper subsidy policy to
encourage biogas plant installation has not been implemented, and little has been done in terms of training
programs among farmers to increase awareness and diffuse a correct waste management policy. Besides,
public investments in research with the involvement of national universities have been minimal.

African countries
Several national programs have been introduced in African countries, also thanks to international initiatives such
as the “Biogas Partnership Programme” and “Biogas for a Better Life,”14 which contribute to the transfer of
some basic knowledge, creating an initial base of specialized competences in the countries involved. However,
national programmes have not been followed by coherent measures to build an effective sectoral system,
developing domestic production and technological capacity, and overall biogas production is still limited.15

2. CONCENTRATED SOLAR POWER
In CSP, in 2020, the two leading countries in terms of installed capacity were Spain and the United States,
followed by Morocco, China, and South Africa, which have been responsible for the bulk of capacity
additions in the past five years.16

Morocco
Morocco’s decision to invest in CSP was driven by the need to satisfy a demand for electricity picking
in the early evening. While solar PV has lower costs, it can only generate electricity when the sun is
shining. CSP, on the other hand, allows thermal storage. The investment was made possible by accessing
concessional financing from the World Bank, the African Development Bank and other European financing
institutions. The involvement of international financial institutions was driven by the opportunity to support
the development of a new technology that could play a critical role in the global shifting away from fossil
fuels. The Clean Technology17 has also invested in the Moroccan CSP project, contributing to building
some initial domestic capacity. After successive projects and a dropping in the CSP price, the industry
has also started attracting private investors. Moreover, CSP plants are often developed in remote areas,
bringing development and jobs to poorer communities.18
The sectoral system is still very immature in the country. However, some incentives have been provided
for higher value-added domestic manufacturing of parts and components, increasing the sourcing of local
components.19 In general, notwithstanding the political commitment toward renewable energies is quite
strong in Morocco, it has been observed a lack of a coordinated approach between the multitudes of
potential donors and a limited capacity in promoting technology and knowledge transfer to build up a solid
domestic capability in the industry.20

China
The development of the Chinese CSP industry is still a recent and ongoing phenomenon, but it has
followed a rather different path compared to other renewable industries in the country, which initially
have been largely dependent on foreign imported technologies and, as in the case of solar PV, also

driven by foreign demand. In the case of CSP, however, China has exploited a technological window
deriving from decreasing investments in demonstration projects in incumbent countries, creating a
space in the global industry. In the late 2000s and early 2010s, the CSP global market was almost
entirely dominated by Spain thanks to generous support policies, which were abandoned in 2012. In
the United States, the support measures were largely stop-and-go which caused some bankruptcies
in the industry. In both countries, the interest and investments in the CSP industry were largely resized.
In 2015, in China, the National Energy Administration asked for bids to develop CSP demonstration
programmes, and in 2016, 20 projects were selected and funded by the government, domestic
utilities and project developers and domestic banks. At the same time, there was a substantial
investment in R&D activity in Chinese universities in collaboration with domestic firms, with the only
limited acquisition of foreign technology licenses.21
The knowledge is mainly domestic in the Chinese CSP industry, rooted in domestic research institutes
and corporate R&D. The whole industry innovation system is largely dominated by domestic actors,
including component providers, system developers, researchers, and financiers. The market is
also mainly domestic, consisting of a public-funded small pilot and larger demonstration projects.
However, the recently formed Chinese CSP industry has also contributed to diffusing the technology
outside China. Domestic research institutes and firms have attracted research contracts from foreign
entities, including testing and developing next-generation receiver technologies in demonstrationscale projects. Under the flag of the Silk Road fund, Chinese banks have provided substantial
amounts of investment to the development of foreign projects. More recently, Chinese firms and
research institutes also contribute to defining global project design and equipment standards, helping
set quality benchmarks for firms from other countries.22
After upgrading to world-class technology, concentrated solar Power in China experienced little further
market development. China rapidly caught up in capabilities development and has reached the global
knowledge frontier. However, its leadership applies mainly to domestic demonstration projects, with
export activity confined to a limited number of engineering, procurement and construction projects in
Europe and the Middle East.23

3. WIND POWER
Wind energy has been increasingly deployed in developing countries. As an energy source, it is highly
dependent on natural conditions, being most conducive at a distance from the equator or in mountainous
areas. It can be deployed onshore or offshore, with the latter being more demanding and costly and
only recently taken up in countries such as Brazil, India and China. Most lead firms are based in Europe
or the US, but a few emerging market multinationals emerged on the global scene from the turn of the
century.24 Most deployed wind turbine technology is grid-connected ‘large’ wind (large turbines in large
farms). Still, a concurrent niche is focused on ‘small’ wind,25 which is often particularly relevant as a
complement to solar PV in rural mini-grids.26
The overall window of opportunity stems from the increasing policy drive to promote renewables, the
changing preference from public and institutional investors and technological developments which sees
onshore wind below parity with electricity produced from fossil fuel sources.27 This window has emerged
in upper-middle-income and lower-middle-income countries and, to some extent, also in low-income
countries. This section presents empirical evidence from green windows of opportunity and their take
up in China, South Africa, Kenya, and Ethiopia.
None of these countries, apart from China, have managed to exploit foreign markets. And there are
differences in the degree to which economic activities of domestic wind deployment are localised and the
importance of foreign firms mentioned above. There is some, but limited, technological upgrading in uppermiddle-income countries. In general, the upgrading process is confined to services in the deployment
chain instead of production activities in the manufacturing chain. Overall, there are three broad types of
sectoral system responses: active, passive and in-between. China represents the most active system

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2023

173

OPENING GREEN WINDOWS
Technological opportunities for a low-carbon world

response. South Africa is an in-between case, while Kenya is passive, and Ethiopia is a case of active
response despite relatively weak preconditions. These cases present weak preconditions such as the
inadequate shape of the sectoral system and the industrial base capacity. Low capacity in the wind sector
means that European and Chinese lead firms dominate the GWO, especially in Kenya and South Africa.
In Ethiopia, while still in the nascent stages of developing a sectoral system around wind power, certain
basic preconditions have been developed, which will be important in subsequent deployment processes.

China
In China, external pressure arising from a commitment to the Kyoto Protocol and, particularly, the Paris
Agreement, and domestic pressure to reduce air pollution in megacities such as Beijing is at the root of
sector-level opportunities. This has translated into the sector and sometimes regional specific opportunities,
often promoted with mission-driven programmes such as the Ride the Wind programme, which was
initiated for embryonic sector formation.28 This programme by China’s State Planning Commission,
launched in January 1997, specified the first wind target of 1GW to be developed by 2001. The Planning
Commission selected a German company, Nordex, as the first foreign partner to develop these projects.
The first 400 MW was financed through Chinese and foreign government loans.29 While the financial
underpinnings were typically global and supported by international organizations, in the beginning, the
GWO has been internalized, and supported by public finance. However, private sources of investment
have been increasingly crowded in with loan guarantees to international investors provided by China
Development Bank.30
Dai et al.31 show how recent global wind energy industry transformations have considerable implications
for Chinese firms seeking to catch up. The technological frontier has advanced first from onshore to
offshore wind turbines and later towards digital systems both at the level of individual turbines and in
terms of management of wind farms.32 These technological shifts open new green windows of opportunity
for firms in the industry. The authors find that Chinese turbine firms show differentiated capabilities in
responding to technological transformation at the global level, which explains variations in catch-up
trajectories. Overall, however, they are not at par with global leaders in digital and hybrid systems. Hain
et al.33 propose a ‘market trap’ where latecomers remain in a follower position and catch up is aborted,
which seems to correspond with the Chinese wind industry. It remains to be seen whether Chinese firms
can leverage complementary capabilities in adjacent sectors to integrate advanced software capabilities
and make inroads in the ‘post-turbine technology regime’.34

South Africa
In South Africa, wind deployment targets and a feed-in tariff were introduced to meet wind energy
deployment goals with the Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) in 2010. In addition, as mentioned in the section
on solar PV, support for a competitive renewable energy auction was introduced in 2011, the Renewable
Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme (REIPPPP). Key in this framework is
integrating multiple criteria for procurement, such as support of local firms, including small firms and firms
owned by disadvantaged groups. So, while seeking to stimulate at the same time domestic and foreign
investments, REIPPPP requires that engineering, procurement and construction contractors (EPCs) have
40 per cent local ownership.35 South Africa is experimenting with domestic window creation, but as
discussed further below, the country is struggling with defining effective supply-side responses.36
Morris et al.37 investigate the wind sectoral system under REIPPPP and examine the effects on the wind
energy value chain concerning the localisation of goods and services. They highlight the interplay between
energy and industrial policy. They argue that policy failure driven by coal-based vested interests, disrupted
system integration and undermined the renewable energy programme which was the cornerstone of the
wind GWO. The policy drive was not sufficiently strong and took on a stop-and-go nature. Problems
with continuity and predictability of the auction bidding process within energy policy have knock-on
effects down the wind energy chain, adversely impacting industrial policy attempts to localise domestic
and foreign enterprises. The uncertainty of the policy (stop and go) meant that foreign enterprises could

not implement local content requirements as local investment became risky. Local suppliers could not
take advantage of new opportunities provided by the policy because banks would not fund investment
projects. According to the authors, the South African government failed to prioritise, develop, and embed
renewable energy as a sustainable economy strategy within its industrial policy framework.

Kenya
In other countries in sub-Saharan Africa, GWOs are more heavily influenced by international actors.
This is shown by Gregersen & Gregersen38 who compare large scale projects in Kenya and Ethiopia.
Systematic frameworks for the evaluation of project proposals are often absent. This means that there
are no mechanisms to ensure that projects are not developed on an ad-hoc basis, promoted by specific
finance and technology supply consortia. Ad-hoc project approval, while constituting an opportunity for
deployment, weakens the bargaining power of governments and typically comes along with informal
‘foreign content requirements’ tied to external sources of finance. Foreign lead firms and investment
consortia, including Chinese groups, tend to take on coordinating roles in the absence of action schemes
like the one implemented in South Africa.39 Demand windows dominate. There is a significant difference
in the degree to which windows of opportunity are domestically created (as in China) or are externally
provided, e.g., in Kenya.
Given the large multinational involvement in the wind sector in East Africa, Gregersen & Gregersen40 explore
‘learning spaces’ in foreign-dominated projects in large scale wind, one European and one Chinese,
project. Focusing on how interactions between different stakeholders in wind power megaprojects can
lead to the accumulation of technological and managerial capabilities, they show that formalised and
tacit knowledge interaction can occur, even in the megaproject setting, but it has limits. In Kenya, the
multiplicity of actors involved in the complex infrastructure Lake Turkana Wind Power (LTWP) project
involves multiple loops of interactions that could foster local-learning opportunities. Still, such learning
largely failed to materialise because of weak pre-existing capabilities among local actors and because no
industrial policy was tied to the expansion of wind.41

Ethiopia
By contrast, in the Ethiopian case, the government and the Ministry of Water, Irrigation, and Electricity
(MoWIE) tied wind projects to industrial development aims by introducing local university consultants to
the projects and creating a local pool of experts. This, according to Gregersen & Gregersen,42 explain that
while there was some local learning in both the Kenyan and the Ethiopian cases in the field of operations
and maintenance (O&M) as well as some learning about and how to add more renewable energy to the
national grid, the Ethiopian Adama case involved different types of learning that did not happen in Kenyan
LTWP. Specifically, this was learning about how to design projects. The Government of Ethiopia requested
that national universities submit proposals and act as owners’ consultants on the project. MoWIE liaised
with several universities that could help to meet wider objectives, and, in the process, they gained valuable
experience in both government agencies and universities. This is an example of how the government has
gone beyond the production system thinking and has involved the knowledge and innovation system,
building elements to ensure more local learning in and around the domestic projects. While still with
several shortcomings, the Ethiopian government has actively designed the wind projects to guarantee
maximum local learning by ensuring that professional users are more involved in the project execution.43

4. ELECTRIC VEHICLES
EVs have started to diffuse in large volumes worldwide, but only to a limited extent in developing countries
when it comes to passenger cars. Countries like India, Indonesia and Brazil possess the infrastructure to
support two-wheeler electric vehicles. Still, they do not have policies for a full-scale transition to electric-run
transportation comparable to those, for instance, in Europe.44 Electric mobility offers ideal opportunities
to create synergies with other technologies discussed in this report and for the broader phasing-in of
renewables to the transport sector. Electric vehicles create new demand for electricity that can be supplied

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2023

by wind, solar, biomass and other renewable sources. In addition to benefits such as reducing carbon
emissions and air pollution, electric mobility could also play an essential role in providing decentralised
storage for variable renewable electricity sources. This section explores the empirical evidence of green
windows related to EVs sector in China, India, Brazil, and South Africa.
The energy demand-side of the techno-economic paradigm shift is still in the stage of the open-ended
search for effective green solutions in many areas. There are relatively clearer paths forward in the
transportation sector: with the increasing technological maturity and price reduction of battery-electric
vehicles, electromobility is now a key viable option – along with some alternative but still less certain
solutions such as biofuels and hydrogen.
It is not yet clear how this transition from combustion engines to electric vehicles will affect the position of
emerging markets in the global automotive sector. It could increase entry barriers and make the competition
more demanding or decrease them and provide new competitive advantages. Much will depend on the
speed of the transition from conventional cars to EVs, the global geography and the knock-on effects on
global value chains. In principle, the opportunity is significant because EVs are simpler, with fewer parts,
compared to traditional cars. Traditionally, the automotive sector has been dominated by relatively small
numbers of global lead firms that have developed region-specific car models and supply chains, with
differentiated industrial structures as a result.45 Consequently, the automotive industries in Brazil, China,
India and South Africa differ widely. Each has widely different prerequisites for gaining or losing from the
green transformation of the automotive sector. Apart from imports of complete electrical vehicles, there is
still relatively little globalisation of production, which is spurred by protectionist measures such as import
duties.

China
Technological windows dominate following the techno-economic paradigm shift from combustion engines
to electric vehicles in the automotive industry. But Chinese intervention in the EV sector can be seen
as creating a green window for domestic take-off by stimulating the demand side and speeding up
deployment. Konda shows the role of two distinct policy phases during sector formation. The goals for
deployment set in the first period had not been achieved by 2012, and so the Government introduced a
new plan for the next eight years which was more comprehensive and paid more attention to developing
capabilities, not just to deployment.46
In 2009, China began mass production in the EV sector without any novel technical knowledge.47 Despite
the subsidies that were made available, customers did not demand EVs in the following years, mostly
owing to their shortcomings compared with internal combustion engine vehicles. In 2010, the battery
technology was not satisfactory as the manufacturing cost per kWh was between 3,400 and 5,000 yuan,
and this presented a large proportion of the total EV costs. Battery life was between three and five years or
circa 160,000 kilometres, making EVs much less of an economic proposition than conventional vehicles.48
By February 2014, battery production cost had decreased to around 3,150 yuan per kWh, which was
still much higher than the 2,000 planned for 2015. The core technology was thus immature until recently.
Hence the government had to address all aspects of the ecosystem. The policies evolved from traditional
green industrial towards broader policies that enable catching up by combining climate and economic
goals. The first creates a demand for a technological solution that is still economically less efficient than
dirtier solutions. The second enables knowledge transfer and creation, and the third boosts production
to fulfil the demand. The case shows that strategies and initiatives that respond to initial green window
opportunities based on building basic production capacity were insufficient for upgrading and deepening
technological capabilities.49
In general, advanced OECD economies dominate the EV sector. Emerging economies are mainly making
inroads in non-passenger cars, such as two-wheelers, three-wheelers and buses. China had surpassed
the United States in EV stock, with 32 per cent of the global share and 44 per cent of worldwide annual
sales in 2016.50 The country is seeing some exports, but still at a low level. Some technological upgrading

has occurred, but there is still uncertainty regarding global competitiveness and markets for low-cost
EVs. For domestic deployment especially in China, ambitious strategies have spurred a high degree of
domestic market sales.

India
In India, the government started the path toward electro-mobility with the ‘National Electric Mobility Mission
Plan 2020’ (NEMMP2020) in 2013. The plan provided a roadmap to achieve sales of 6-7 million EVs in
2020, among which 400,000 units of e-passenger cars. In 2015, the government supported the plan with
the “Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles” (FAME) scheme, which transitioned in its
second phase (FAME-II) two years later. FAME-II ends in 2022 and includes stimulation for the purchase
and the deployment of charging infrastructure.
The FAME policy encourages manufacturers to use batteries with advanced chemistry—lithium—instead
of environmentally less-friendly lead-acid variants. The EV policy in India is spread among three levels
of authority—national, state, city—and most laws and regulations are placed at the state or city level.
Aside from the FAME scheme, India supports the automobile industry with the “Make in India” program,
which stimulates FDI through the offer of several incentives to foreign investor like tax exemption and
concession and subsidy, provides tax incentives for R&D, and with the “Phased Manufacturing program”
(PMP). The PMP has reduced a “basic custom duty” (BCD) in 2017 (between 0 - 25 per cent) for electric
vehicles, assemblies, and EV parts to support electro-mobility development. In 2020, BCD started
gradually increasing (10 – 50 per cent) to stimulate domestic manufacturing.51 India’s auto component
sector is growing faster than the sector of complete vehicles and exports a quarter of the production. In
the last three years, it attracted high investments from domestic and foreign entities, e.g., Japan Bank for
International Cooperation ($1 billion), Toyota Kirloskar Motors ($272.81 million) for EV components. The
electrification of the automobile sector allows establishing a new battery sector and interconnects with
the existing IT sector. According to the Indian Energy Storage Alliance, the battery market potential was
$580 million in 2019. It is forecasted to grow to $14.9 billion by 2027. Currently, India is dependent on
importing lithium, but the newly discovered lithium resources in 2020 could enable faster development
of the sector.52 In electric two and three-wheelers, the battery cost presents up to half of the vehicle’s
price. Thus, the government allowed manufacturers to sell vehicles without batteries and encouraged the
development of different battery swapping services.53
In this country, responses to the existence of green windows in the EVs sector are mainly confined to
national flagship automotive firms with a weak innovation system formation.

South Africa
Green windows depend on natural resources for battery production. In South Africa, increasing global use
of EVs provides the country with special opportunities to explore a competitive advantage in the lithiumion batteries value chain.54
In 2013, the government in South Africa introduced the ‘Automotive Production and Development
Programme’,55 which did not specifically address the EV sector but the whole automobile industry. The
policy’s four pillars—import duty, production incentives, assembly allowance, investment scheme—
managed to keep the industry stable but had not improved its global position. In the middle of the previous
decade, a policy targeting increasing pollution by road transportation (GTS 2018 – 50) was implemented. It
stimulates domestic production, R&D, and consumption of alternatives to vehicles on internal combustion.
At the end of the APDP period, the government updated it with the South African Automotive Masterplan
(SAAM 2021-2035), with the primary goal to address the decreasing local content in the automobile
industry (from 46.6 per cent in 2012 to 38.7 per cent in 2016). Despite policy emphasis on the importance
of EVs in the future, it does not make special provisions.56 Overall, the EV development has explicit support
in the policies related to cleaner transportation, mainly with penalizing dirtier solutions—Environmental
CO2 levy— but not in the manufacturing.57 South Africa has established battery production and recycling,

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2023

Technological opportunities for a low-carbon world

mainly lead-acid type.58 The country is also rich in some required raw materials—manganese (78 per cent
of the world’s resources), nickel, calcium fluoride, titanium, aluminium, copper, and iron. The government
plans that an existing industry will also cover electric vehicles’ batteries and supports it under the ‘The
Technology and Human Resources for Industry Programme’, which involves the University of the Western
Cape, the uYilo eMobility Programme, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, and Zellow
Technology.59 The first lithium-ion mega-factory—The MegaMillion Energy Company—plans to start a
manufacturing plant in 2022.60 South Africa is an important automotive hub, especially for spare parts.
The stable position in GVC could be upgraded by the development of the electric vehicle sector, however,
slower adoption of new technologies poses a threat to losing the GVC position.
For South Africa, the insertion into automotive GVCs means that the techno-economic paradigm shift
could make significant parts of the domestic supply chain obsolete because many locally produced
components are no longer needed.

Brazil
Brazil introduced the first policy for cleaner transportation in 1986 (PROCONVE) to address rising pollution
in the urban and intense-production areas. In early 2000, the Government introduced several incentives
for R&D, and a decade later for building the charging infrastructure. Looking at the policies supporting
domestic production, the Government introduced four incentives in the last decade. Starting in 2011 with
the national development bank (BNDES) Fundo project and two years later with “Inovar Auto” covering
the period from 2013 to 2017, which was later replaced with the current “Rota 2030 program”. Brazil is
rich in natural resources needed for EV batteries production, having the third biggest reserves of graphite
and nickel, and the seventh of lithium.61 Despite having 8 per cent of global lithium reserves, Brazil only
accounts for 0.7 per cent of world production, thus lithium has to be imported.62 The country also has
existing low-voltage battery production of industrial and stationary batteries, based on local knowledge.
However, there is a lack of connection between scientific research and production.63 Moreover, Brazil has
some existing lead-acid batteries manufacturers (e.g., Moura Group) and it is involved in the R&D and
development of lithium batteries. Finally, the Brazilian company Pxis (a collaboration between CODEMGE
and Oxis Energy) is planning to establish the first mass-production plan of lithium-sulphur batteries, which
in the laboratory stage have overperformed the current lithium batteries.64
In the country, the success of the locally produced flex-fuel engine and bioethanol industry makes the
innovation system path-dependent, and there are vested interests in keeping the focus on bioethanol.
Insufficient response means that other regional hubs close to lead markets may be better positioned to
