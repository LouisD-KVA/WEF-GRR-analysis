No respite

Introduction
There is no respite for the global economy. Two years ago, it was shaken by the onset
of the pandemic, as an overwhelming health crisis turned into an overwhelming
economic crisis. While the after-tremors of the pandemic still reverberate, two new
shocks hit home in the year under review: the unexpected resurgence of inflation
and the tragic war in Ukraine. Last year’s Annual Economic Report (AER) raised the
prospect of a bumpy pandexit; bumps have turned out to be a one-two punch.
These tumultuous events are bound to have far-reaching consequences. Are
we perhaps witnessing a regime change, from a low- to a high-inflation regime? Is
the global economy flirting with stagflation? And are we seeing signs of an end to
the post-World War II globalisation era? Meanwhile, the crypto universe is in
turmoil, reminding us that there are important developments in the monetary
system that we cannot neglect.
On the macro front, policy is facing daunting challenges. In some ways, they
are not new; but in others, they are unique. As Mark Twain quipped, “History does
not repeat itself, but it often rhymes.” The world economy experienced stagflation
in the 1970s, following a shift away from a low-inflation regime. The new element is
that, against the backdrop of historically low interest rates, debt levels – private and
public – have never been as high. This is far from inconsequential. Moreover, the
monetary and financial system is in the throes of the digital revolution. This, too,
albeit in a different way, is far from immaterial.
Our AER tackles these issues head-on. What happened in the year under review?
What are the risks ahead? What can policy do? And where is the monetary system
heading as the digital revolution proceeds? What vision should guide policy?

Never say never
Resilient but losing momentum and buffeted by non-economic forces: in a nutshell,
this is how global growth evolved over the review period.
Growth proved resilient for much of 2021.
In fact, in 2021 as a whole, the world economy expanded at its fastest rate in
almost 50 years. And the expansion was broad-based. This confirmed the unique
nature of the Covid-19 recession. An artificial suppression of activity due to the
health emergency gave way to a strong rebound once the containment measures
were lifted. In addition, the outsize policy support, both monetary and fiscal,
provided a major impulse. The scenario in which economic scars would have held
back growth did not materialise.
Growth lost momentum as the review period progressed.
First was the spread of a new virus variant (Omicron) in late 2021, which
prompted countries to put in place new containment measures. As it turned out, the
impact was smaller than initially feared. The virus proved milder than expected and
so did the necessary policy-induced restraint on activity. The main exception was
China. The strict anti-Covid measures caused a major slowdown in growth, adding
to the effect of regulatory measures designed to rein in the real estate sector.

Then was the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict in February 2022.
Probably the most significant geopolitical event since the fall of the Iron Curtain,
the war is first and foremost a humanitarian tragedy. But its near-term impact on
economic activity is also substantial. The impact has not been felt so much through
the sanctions-induced drop in Russia’s GDP – although the imprint on world growth
is material. Nor has it been felt, so far, through its direct financial consequences –
although more may be in store (see below). Rather, it has operated mainly through
soaring commodity prices – notably energy and food – as well as concerns about
the war’s broader ramifications.
This shock is inherently stagflationary. To be sure, its impact on growth is
uneven across the world. Commodity exporters fare better than importers. But, for
the world as a whole, the outcome is unambiguously contractionary. Since
commodities are a key production input, an increase in their cost constrains output.
At the same time, soaring commodity prices have boosted inflation everywhere,
exacerbating a shift that was already well in train before the onset of the war.
Indeed, the most remarkable development during the review period was the
return of inflation. The biggest challenge for central banks post-Great Financial
Crisis (GFC) had been to lift inflation back to target. As events unfolded, however,
what initially appeared a temporary blip, driven by Covid-induced idiosyncratic
price adjustments, turned into a much broader surge, across prices and countries.
By April 2022, three quarters of economies were experiencing inflation above 5%.
Inflation was back, not as a long-sought friend, but as a threatening foe.
Just like most observers, we at the BIS did not quite anticipate the strength and
persistence of the surge. To be sure, in last year’s AER we did explore a plausible
high-inflation scenario. In the end, however, the scenario fell short of reality.
Why the miss? Humility is in order. But probably the best explanation involves
the confluence of three forces – an explanation that necessarily cannot do justice to
cross-country differences (see Chapter I for details). First, the surprisingly strong
rebound in aggregate demand, beyond what was implicit in the scenario. The huge
policy stimulus combined with households’ pent-up spending turbocharged activity.
Second, a surprisingly persistent “pivot” or rotation of demand from services to
goods. Although people did spend, they did not flock back to contact-intensive
services, such as restaurants and hotels, as widely as expected. Finally, there were
some surprising difficulties in adjusting supply. Their most visible manifestation are
the “bottlenecks” that held back production around the world. Think, in particular,
of those that hit raw materials and semiconductors as well as freight and transport.
While, initially, the disruptions reflected primarily pandemic-related measures,
demand strength then took over.
Bottlenecks in global value chains aggravated these constraints. Complex
production networks, sprawling across the world and structured to cut costs,
betrayed their fragility as the disruptions hit them. Moreover, firms started hoarding
inventories as a precaution. The shift from just-in-time to just-in-case inventory
management exacerbated shortages.
Against this backdrop, central banks started to normalise policy, albeit at
speeds that partly reflected varying country-specific conditions. First off the blocks
were several central banks in emerging market economies (EMEs), mostly in central
and eastern Europe and in Latin America. Because of the slower recovery and a
better inflation record, those in Asia moved later and more cautiously. Among
advanced economies (AEs), the Federal Reserve was one of the first to respond as
inflation pressures intensified. The ECB signalled that it would start removing
accommodation later in 2022 while the Bank of Japan stuck to its exceptionally
accommodative policy. The main exception was the People’s Bank of China, which
eased policy to support flagging growth.

Near-term prospects
What are the near-term prospects for the global economy?
Context is of the essence. For the first time in the post-World War II era, the
global economy is facing the threat of higher inflation, and hence the need to keep
it in check, against the backdrop of elevated financial vulnerabilities. Looming large
among these are historically high debt levels, both private and public, and rich
valuations, notably for residential property.
There is a narrow path ahead. It is possible to envisage a smooth resolution of
the economic tensions. In this scenario, inflationary pressures ease spontaneously
due to an end to bottlenecks alongside a reversal in the war-induced increases in
commodity prices. This reduces the size of the required monetary policy tightening
and mitigates the associated slowdown in economic activity – a soft landing. But the
outcome could be less benign. The worst-case scenario would be stubborn inflation
pressures that prompt a stronger tightening. This could trigger a larger slowdown,
including a recession, alongside financial stress – a stagflationary hard landing.
Hence a natural sequence of questions. Will higher inflation become entrenched?
How far could growth falter? Will the financial sector come under strain?

Inflation
Policy response aside, whether inflation becomes entrenched or not ultimately
depends on whether wage-price spirals will develop. The risk should not be
underestimated, owing to the inherent dynamics of transitions from low- to highinflation regimes.
Three reasons stand out. First, we have already seen outsize and persistent
increases in especially salient prices, such as those of food and energy. Households
and workers’ perceptions of inflation and expectations of its future evolution are
especially sensitive to them. Second, given the broadening of price pressures,
inflation in general has no doubt moved out of the zone of “rational inattention”,
within which it has little impact on behaviour, into that of sharp focus, in which it
starts to influence behaviour more substantially. Finally, price-induced cuts in real
wages are likely to prompt workers to seek to recoup the loss of purchasing power.
Similarly, firms should find it easier to translate higher wages into higher prices
given how generalised wage and cost pressures are.
We may be reaching a tipping point, beyond which an inflationary psychology
spreads and becomes entrenched. This would mean a major paradigm shift.
These observations underscore some stylised features of the inflation process,
as analysed in detail in Chapter II. For a start, low- and high-inflation regimes are
very different animals. When inflation settles at a low level, it reflects mainly changes
in sector-specific, or relative, prices as opposed to more synchronised ones. In
addition, it exhibits self-equilibrating properties, as these price changes, including
those of “salient” items such as oil and food, tend to leave only a temporary imprint
on inflation. One reason is that, as the idiosyncratic fraction of price changes is
greater, differences in the price indices that matter for individual agents – households
and firms – are commensurately larger. Not only is economy-wide inflation less
noticeable, it is also less relevant. High-inflation regimes are the mirror image of
low-inflation ones. In particular, they don’t exhibit self-equilibrating properties, price
changes are much more synchronised and inflation is much more of a focal point for
the behaviour of economic agents, exerting a major influence on it.
This also means that transitions from low- to high-inflation regimes tend to be
self-reinforcing. As inflation rises and becomes a focal point for agents’ behaviour,
behavioural patterns tend to strengthen the transition. Agents redouble their

BIS Annual Economic Report 2022

xi

efforts to protect themselves from losses in purchasing power or profit squeezes,
both actual and, increasingly, prospective ones. And wage negotiations tend to
become more centralised, while demands for indexation proliferate and contract
lengths shrink.
Put differently, when changes in relative prices are large and persistent enough,
they test the self-equilibrating properties of the low-inflation regime. All the more
so if labour and product markets are tight, which puts further upward pressure on
both prices and wages.
From this perspective, so far, the signs are not entirely reassuring. True, wage
growth has been uneven across countries. It has been especially strong where
aggregate demand pressures have been more in evidence, not least in countries
that have made large terms-of-trade gains or have a history of high inflation. Hence
the differences between Latin America and Asia. But in many countries, a substantial
part, if not the bulk, of wage renegotiations are still to come. And in some of them
demands for higher indexation and more centralisation of wage bargaining have
already surfaced. Moreover, terms-of-trade losses may actually strengthen costpush inflationary pressures with a lag: when the cake becomes smaller, the fight
over it becomes bigger.

Growth
Two specific factors darken growth prospects at the current juncture: much of the
impact of developments in commodity markets is still to be felt, and macro-financial
vulnerabilities loom large. These factors matter in and of themselves. But they are
especially significant against the monetary policy tightening under way.
So far, the effect of commodity market ructions has operated mainly through
higher prices. It would become much bigger should supply constraints kick in as
well.
As regards energy, embargoes and price caps are on the horizon or being
implemented. Furthermore, investment in fossil energy sources has been remarkably
subdued, not least owing to the uncertainty-fraught transition towards zero
emissions.
As regards food, a crisis looms ahead. The war has wreaked havoc with the
supply of staples, such as wheat, and of fertilisers, which will greatly curtail crop
production. In addition, the tendency to cut food exports to favour the domestic
market inhibits distribution across the world and discourages production. Finally,
soaring food prices threaten to trigger major social and political unrest, especially
in lower-income countries. A food crisis is a humanitarian calamity that may also
have crippling consequences for the economy.
What about the conjunction of historically high private debt levels and elevated
asset prices? Much will depend on the evolution of interest rates and their knockon effects on financial markets, since high indebtedness heightens the sensitivity of
expenditures and the risk of financial strains.
A simple, highly stylised statistical exercise developed in Chapter I sheds some
light on this question, suggesting that the sensitivity of the economy to interest
rates is substantial. At one extreme – used purely as an analytical reference – in a
scenario in which interest rates are held constant, asset prices continue to rise
alongside debt levels, pointing to a further build-up in vulnerabilities. In one in
which interest rates follow the market-implied path, by 2025 GDP could be roughly
1.5% lower relative to the constant-rate baseline. And if they follow the steeper
path of the early 2000s, by 2025 debt service ratios could climb back to their GFC
levels while both house and equity prices would see steep declines. As a result, the
shortfall of GDP relative to the baseline is around 3%.

xii

BIS Annual Economic Report 2022

Naturally, these results are purely illustrative. They are based on average
relationships since the mid-1980s for a number of AEs and are subject to substantial
uncertainty. That said, they provide a sense of the orders of magnitude involved
and hence of the trade-offs faced by policymakers.
Moreover, macro-financial vulnerabilities need not weigh down on growth only
if interest rates increase. This is the case in China, where the authorities have sought
to contain the build-up of risks in the real estate sector – a key driver of growth for
the country – so as to make growth more sustainable. Indeed, the combination of
financial imbalances and stringent lockdowns casts a long shadow on China’s
growth prospects and hence on those of the global economy.

Financial system stress
Against this global backdrop, the resilience of the financial system will be tested.
Here, while deeply interconnected, it is useful to make a distinction between banks
and non-bank financial intermediaries (NBFIs).
Thanks to the wide-ranging post-GFC financial reforms, the banking sector is
now in a much stronger financial position. Above all, banks are much better
capitalised. This is what allowed prudential authorities to temporarily relax the
regulatory and supervisory constraints in the early stages of the Covid crisis, thereby
supporting economic activity.
But there is no room for complacency. For one, although banks’ direct exposures
to developments in Russia are comparatively small and manageable, indirect
exposures are more opaque. More importantly, macroeconomic prospects are a
major source of risk. Stylised simulations suggest that credit losses could be material.
Based on past relationships, along the market-implied interest rate path, bank credit
losses would be broadly in line with historical averages across AEs. But they would
be substantially higher in the scenario in which interest rates rise more steeply.
Vulnerabilities in the NBFI sector are more significant. Not only do they matter
for banks, as they represent potentially large and opaque exposures. The losses
from the failure of a leveraged fund (Archegos) in 2021 are a case in point. These
also matter in and of themselves. This was underscored by the financial market
turmoil in March 2020. At the time, an abrupt “dash for cash” prompted massive
central bank intervention to stabilise markets. Structural vulnerabilities in the form
of hidden leverage and liquidity mismatches loom large in the asset management
sector. Hence the urgent need to redouble regulatory efforts in this area.

Policy challenges
Just as the policymakers were breathing a sigh of relief with the end of the
pandemic in sight, the flare-up of inflation and the Russia-Ukraine conflict have
raised new and daunting challenges. It is useful to distinguish the near-term from
the longer-term ones, although the dividing line between the two is quite fuzzy.

Near-term challenges
The overriding near-term challenge is to prevent the global economy from shifting
from a low- to a high-inflation regime. In doing so, policymakers will need to limit
the costs to the economy as far as possible and to safeguard financial stability.
Some pain, however, will be inevitable. As historical experience has shown time and
again, the long-term costs of allowing inflation to become entrenched far outweigh
the short-term ones of bringing it under control.

BIS Annual Economic Report 2022

This is not just an economic challenge about policy calibration; it is also,
importantly, a political economy one. Ever since the GFC, and even more so
following the Covid crisis, both monetary and fiscal policies have worked to boost
economic activity. With inflation languishing stubbornly below targets, there was
no obvious trade-off between easy policy and inflation. Indeed, fiscal policy was
invoked more than once to relieve some of the burden placed on monetary policy.
To be sure, trade-offs did not magically vanish. The exceptionally low interest rates
that persisted for so long did contribute to the gradual build-up of financial
vulnerabilities. But now trade-offs have come into view much more starkly.
Take fiscal policy first. The economic slowdown will further widen public sector
deficits. While this will cushion the blow to economic activity, it will also further
raise government debt from its historical peaks. And as the cost of living soars in
the wake of the sharp increases in the prices of food and energy, pressures to
provide additional support will mount. It is essential that this support be targeted
and temporary so as not to endanger fiscal sustainability further. So far, however,
governments have relied more on untargeted measures, which are more costly and
harder to reverse.
For monetary policy, the self-reinforcing nature of transitions from low- to
high-inflation regimes heightens the calibration difficulties (Chapter II). In general,
the self-equilibrating properties of inflation in a well established and credible lowinflation regime allow the central bank to accept moderate, possibly persistent
deviations, from narrowly defined targets. Indeed, this is desirable, since there is
evidence that, in such a regime, monetary policy loses traction owing to the large
role played by sector-specific (idiosyncratic) price changes. The more vigorous
actions required would increase any associated costs, such as those of interest rates
that remain exceptionally low for long. But, crucially, once the regime is tested
hard, as it is now, the transition can gather speed. This puts a premium on a timely
and decisive response – all the more so given the well known lags with which
monetary policy affects expenditures and then inflation.
In such a context, two sources of uncertainty complicate the calibration.
The first concerns the evolution of inflation. The key problem is that leading
indicators have not proved fully fit for purpose (Chapter II). The broadening of price
pressures or the pickup in underlying measures of inflation can help, but they
provide relatively little information beyond short horizons. Measures of inflation
expectations can also be useful, but they have their own drawbacks. Those derived
from financial asset prices need not reflect the expectations of the economic agents
that matter most – workers and firms. And those derived from household and firm
surveys tend to be very backward-looking. In addition, more formal models, which
are necessary to chart the inflation path at longer horizons, are least reliable
precisely when needed most – during transitions. So far, these sets of indicators are
sending mixed signals. Broadening price increases and higher expectations provide
reasons to worry, at least for the near term; models tend to paint a more benign
picture, but arguably an overly rosy one.
By far the most reliable indicator is evidence of wages chasing prices – secondround effects. But by the time these are clearly visible, inflation may already be
becoming entrenched. Hence the need to focus on softer information, such as signs
of changes in inflation psychology and attitudes to price increases.
The second source of uncertainty concerns the strength of policy transmission.
As discussed, private debt levels at historical peaks and elevated valuations could
make expenditures especially sensitive. And after a long spell of unusually low
interest rates and ample liquidity, financial markets could overreact. While, so far,
financial conditions have tightened, sharper adjustments could be in store. In fact,
inflation-adjusted (real) interest rates have been falling as inflation has picked up.

xiv

BIS Annual Economic Report 2022

Hence a policy dilemma opens up. Uncertainty about the evolution of inflation,
about financial market reactions and about expenditure decisions may counsel
caution. But the risk of inflation becoming entrenched calls for a more pre-emptive
and vigorous response. In navigating this dilemma, good communication may help,
but only up to a point. The overriding priority is to avoid falling behind the curve,
which would ultimately entail a more abrupt and vigorous adjustment. This would
amplify the economic and social costs of bringing inflation under control.
Against this backdrop, and cross-country differences aside, EMEs are especially
vulnerable. They are more at the mercy of global financial conditions, which are
likely to tighten further, including through dollar appreciation, and they have less
room for policy manoeuvre. So far, capital flows have been less disruptive than in
previous episodes, such as the taper tantrum. No doubt, more comprehensive
policy frameworks have helped, involving a judicious reliance on foreign exchange
intervention and macroprudential measures. And so has pre-emptive tightening
where incipient inflationary pressures were stronger. Also helpful is the fact that the
share of foreign investors in domestic markets has already shrunk. But the tougher
tests may still lie ahead.

Longer-term challenges
As policymakers struggle to meet the urgent near-term challenges, they should not
lose sight of a key longer-term one – regaining policy safety margins. As discussed
in detail in last year’s AER, over time the room for policy manoeuvre has narrowed
substantially. Government debt levels are at historical peaks, interest rates, both
nominal and real, have been falling to historical troughs and central bank balance
sheets have risen to levels previously seen only in wartime. The recent tightening of
monetary policy has, so far, only marginally changed this picture, at least in AEs.
Economies operating without safety margins are exposed and vulnerable.
The current challenging environment does have one silver lining: it provides an
obvious opportunity for monetary policy to finally normalise. That said, it has also
highlighted a conundrum. Since regaining policy headroom is a joint task, the two
policies tend to work at cross purposes along the normalisation path. Now, monetary
policy tightening is materially raising the government’s financing costs at a time
when further demands on spending, both short- and longer-term, are growing.
Moreover, where central banks have engaged in large-scale asset purchases,
higher interest rates will also reduce central bank remittances to the government
(see last year’s AER). These central banks have de facto replaced long-term debt
with debt indexed to the overnight interest rate – the rate on bank reserves. As a
result, in the largest advanced economies, as much as 30–50% of marketable
government debt is effectively overnight. In the process, losses could heighten
political economy risks for central banks.
In part, this long-term joint normalisation challenge is itself the reflection of a
deeper problem. For far too long, there has been a temptation to turn to fiscal and
monetary policy to boost growth, regardless of the underlying causes of weakness.
For fiscal policy, in particular, loosening during contractions has not given way to
consolidation during expansions. The temptation to postpone adjustment has been
too strong. Such a strategy has arguably generated unrealistic expectations and
demands for further support.
As discussed in more detail in Chapter I, the only way of promoting robust
long-term growth is to implement ambitious structural reforms. Unfortunately, such
reforms have been flagging for too long. These reforms are more important than
ever at the current juncture, given the signs that globalisation may go into reverse,
partly due to geopolitical considerations.

The future monetary system
Digital innovation will also surely play a key role in the long-term growth story, not
least through its impact on the shape of the future monetary system (Chapter III).
Policymakers face both urgent and important tasks. Some of these important tasks
do not always figure in the breathless commentary of market observers. A critical
one is to put in place the components of a future monetary system that serves the
public interest.
As a case in point on the twin dimensions of urgent and important policy
challenges, this AER comes out at a time of turmoil in the crypto universe. The
recent implosions of the Terra stablecoin and its twin coin Luna are only the most
spectacular collapses in the crypto sector. As we write, many lesser-known coins
have seen their prices drop by more than 90% relative to their peaks last year.
Traditional financial stability concerns stemming from run risk are an urgent policy
challenge. However, focusing on prices diverts attention away from the deeper
structural flaws in crypto that make it unsuitable as the basis of a monetary system
that serves society. We should also keep these longer-term structural issues on our
radar.
For one, the prevalence of stablecoins in the crypto universe indicates a
pervasive need for crypto to piggyback on the credibility of central bank money.
Only the central bank can provide the nominal anchor that crypto craves. Crypto
started by turning its back on central bank money, but it has quickly rediscovered
the need for the unit of account function of central bank money. The same goes for
the medium of exchange function of money. Stablecoins are used to facilitate
transactions across more than 10,000 crypto coins, all competing for the attention
of speculative buyers.
The proliferation of coins also highlights the fragmentation of the crypto
universe, with many incompatible settlement layers jostling for a place in the
limelight. Gone is any pretence that money serves a coordination role. Money is the
pre-eminent example of network effects, which give rise to the virtuous circle of
greater use and greater acceptance. Rather than a single money gaining general
acceptance, thousands of different coins proliferate. Under the plausible-sounding
motto of “decentralisation and democratisation of finance”, crypto platforms have
mushroomed, all claiming to offer settlement of financial transactions. But the
congestion and high costs of these platforms have only opened the way for new
entrants, which cut corners on security in order to offer greater transaction capacity.
Money and its network effects should have the property of “the more, the
merrier”: the more money meets general acceptance, the more useful it becomes in
serving the public interest. Instead, the crypto universe heads in the opposite
direction: “the more, the sorrier”. The only participants who profit are the crypto
insiders, who extract rents from the speculative market on the back of new entrants
left holding the bag.
Having said all of this, the rise of crypto highlights the place of technology in
the popular imagination, and its galvanising role in debates on the shape of things
to come. In spite of its well documented flaws, crypto offers a tantalising glimpse of
potentially useful technical features that could enhance the capabilities of the
current monetary system. Notable examples include composability and automatic
execution, which represent features with a potential to deliver instantaneous
settlement of transactions and transform the efficiency of economic arrangements.
The vision for the future monetary system set out in Chapter III is a fusion of
these enhanced technical capabilities with the core of trust provided by central
bank money. The traditional strengths of the two-tier system and the division of
labour between the central bank and the private sector can be translated into a

xvi

BIS Annual Economic Report 2022

setting with wholesale CBDCs, tokenised deposits and other tokenised securities or
assets. The classical notion of settlement via the book entries of intermediaries can
find new expression in DLT platforms on which tokens are transferred in settlement.
The economics remain the same, but the technological medium is transformed.
Retail fast payment systems with interoperability powered by application
programming interfaces, or APIs, bear a strong family resemblance to retail CBDCs.
The metaphor for the future monetary system is that of a tree. With a solid
trunk provided by the central bank, the tree hosts a rich and vibrant ecosystem of
private sector service providers serving users in order to meet their economic
needs. And this ecosystem is rooted, figuratively speaking, in settlement on the
central bank’s balance sheet.
Central banks, as guardians of the monetary system, are embarked on a long
journey to fulfil the vision of making it versatile and robust. This journey is necessary
to put in place arrangements that anticipate future developments rather than
merely react to past developments. So, while the sound and fury of collapsing
crypto prices grabs all the attention, it is incumbent on us in the central bank
community to look ahead to these longer-term goals. For if we do not start today,
we will never get there.

Growth was resilient, at least until the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Inflation rose to
multi-decade highs against a backdrop of persistently goods-intensive demand and constrained
supply.

•

Stagflation risks loom large, owing to high inflation, the war in Ukraine and slower growth in China.
Pre-existing macro-financial vulnerabilities magnify the risks, which could disrupt financial systems
and strain emerging market economies.

•

The most pressing monetary policy task is to restore low and stable inflation, while limiting as far as
possible the cost to economic activity and preserving financial stability. Over the medium run, there
is a need to sustainably rebuild monetary and fiscal buffers. Governments should reignite supply
side growth drivers.

Powerful non-economic forces once again shaped economic developments over
the past year. The emergence of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 dashed hopes of
a quick and smooth global “pandexit”. Meanwhile, the invasion of Ukraine triggered
the largest European armed conflict in decades. First and foremost a humanitarian
disaster, the war also had major repercussions for commodity and financial markets,
and global supply chains.
For much of the year, growth was resilient. The global economy expanded
strongly in 2021, although in the United States and China it fell short of expectations.
As the review year progressed, the expansion lost some momentum, with supply
constraints, Omicron and the war in Ukraine blowing headwinds.
Against this backdrop, global inflation rose to multi-decade highs. At first,
higher inflation was seen as transitory, reflecting increased relative prices for a small
number of pandemic-affected items. But it proved persistent, broadening over
time. In response, central banks generally brought forward the timing and pace of
policy tightening. Higher inflation and shifting expectations of the policy response
led to bouts of financial market volatility, with financial conditions tightening
substantially as the year progressed, albeit from an exceptionally easy state.
This combination of forces makes for a challenging outlook. The mix of high
inflation, high and volatile commodity prices and significant geopolitical tensions
bears an uncomfortable resemblance to past episodes of global stagflation. An
uncertain growth outlook in China reinforces the downside risks. Unlike in the past,
stagflation today would occur alongside heightened financial vulnerabilities,
including stretched asset prices and high debt levels, which could magnify any
growth slowdown.
In this environment, policymakers face several challenges. In the short term,
the priority is to bring inflation down while limiting as far as possible the cost to
economic activity and preserving financial stability.1 At the same time, there is an

imperative to rebuild monetary and fiscal buffers through a durable normalisation
of policy settings. Recent economic developments further complicate this task.
Fiscal policy in particular faces pressure to address higher living costs and, in some
countries, increase military expenditures, while having to honour longer-term
commitments to “green” the economy. These challenges put a premium on supply
side reforms to promote sustainable growth.
This chapter first describes the key economic and financial developments over
the past year. It then examines the looming stagflation risks. Finally, it elaborates on
the policy challenges.

The year in retrospect
Global growth loses momentum as inflation returns
The year under review started well. Global GDP is estimated to have grown by 6.3%
in 2021, its fastest rate in almost 50 years, and in line with expectations at the time
of last year’s Annual Economic Report (Graph 1.A).
The expansion in 2021 was broad-based. Japan aside, most advanced
economies (AEs) grew strongly, bolstered by the easing of most remaining
pandemic-related restrictions and very accommodative fiscal and monetary policy.
Growth in emerging market economies (EMEs) (excluding China) varied, but as a
group they expanded by 6.5%, supported by buoyant global goods trade, easy
global financial conditions and, for commodity exporters, higher terms of trade.
Developments in China were less positive. Admittedly, GDP still grew by a solid
8.1% in 2021. However, this fell short of expectations. Regulatory interventions in
the real estate and IT sectors weighed on activity. In addition, more frequent and
broader lockdowns, in line with the authorities’ “dynamic zero-Covid” policy,
disrupted supply networks and undercut consumption.

The global expansion lost momentum as the review period progressed. Soaring
infections once Omicron emerged in late 2021 cut consumer spending and, in some
countries, labour supply (Graph 1.B). And, just as the expansion resumed, the war in
Ukraine dealt a further blow. GDP growth forecasts for 2022 were marked down,
particularly for countries more affected by the conflict (Graph 1.C).
In a striking break with the recent past, global inflation climbed to multi-decade
highs. By early 2022, it exceeded central bank targets in almost all AEs, and had
risen above 5% in more than three quarters of them (Graph 2.A). The share of EMEs
with inflation above 5% was almost as high. Higher inflation was less prevalent in
Asia. But even there, it generally rose above target as the year progressed, with the
notable exception of China.
The flare-up in inflation came as a surprise to most observers. At the end of
2020, forecasts were generally projecting inflation at or below central bank targets
(Graph 2.B). Even in mid-2021, by which time inflation had already started to rise,
most forecasters underestimated the extent or persistence of the increase.2 Contributing
to the miss, the increase was initially concentrated in a narrow set of items, such as
durable goods, food and energy. These price increases were widely interpreted as
one-off or transitory relative price adjustments to pandemic-induced shifts in supply
and demand. But inflation progressively broadened (Graph 2.C). By early 2022, growth
in service prices, which tends to be more persistent, exceeded its pre-pandemic
level in much of the world (Graph 3).
Higher inflation reflected a confluence of factors.
First, the recovery from the Covid recession has been unusually rapid, particularly
in AEs (Graph 4.A). Massive fiscal and monetary policy support early in the pandemic
bolstered household incomes despite large falls in GDP. This income boost – much of
which was initially saved – paved the way for spending to bounce back as activity
restrictions eased in 2021. However, some of this additional spending translated into

Second, the pandemic-induced rotation of aggregate demand to goods from
services, especially contact-intensive ones, proved surprisingly persistent. Little
demand rotated back, even after most containment measures were lifted (Graph 5.A).
Strong price increases by firms operating at full capacity in industries facing high
demand were not matched by slower price growth elsewhere.5 As a result, inflation
rose even as output remained below its pre-pandemic trend and labour markets
pointed to spare capacity.

Rising commodity prices: are we set for a repeat of the 1970s?

The past year has seen a significant rise in global inflation alongside higher commodity prices. This
combination recalls the experience of the 1970s, particularly the aftermath of oil crises in 1973 and 1979.
Those crises contributed to higher inflation and to a slowdown in global growth, which declined from an
average of 5.5% in the decade leading up to the 1973 oil crisis to 2.5% in the following one. There are several
reasons to expect recent commodity price rises to be less disruptive than those of the 1970s: recent price rises
are proportionally smaller, albeit spread across a broader range of commodities, commodity supply has so far
held up better, the global economy has become vastly more efficient in its use of many commodities, and the
inflationary backdrop is more benign. That said, adverse outcomes are still possible if policymakers repeat the
mistakes of the 1970s.
Recent commodity market developments differ from those of the 1970s in several respects. The 1970s
crises were concentrated in the oil market. In the 1973 crisis, oil prices more than doubled in the space of a
month (Graph A1.A). Prices rose to a similar extent in the 1979 crisis, albeit more gradually. Recent oil price
increases have been modest in comparison. Oil prices have increased by around 50% since the middle of 2021,
although they briefly rose more after the start of the war in Ukraine in late February.1 Taking a longer-term
perspective, oil prices today are still within the range of long-term averages, being at roughly the same level
in nominal (US dollar) terms as they were in mid-2014, and about 20% lower in real terms. In contrast, the
1970s crises took oil prices to historic highs.
But while oil prices have so far increased by less than during the 1970s crises, a broader range of
commodities has experienced price increases. The prices of non-oil energy, some agricultural goods, fertilisers
and metals have all risen significantly over the past year, to be well above their pre-pandemic levels
(Graph A1.B). Increases in European natural gas prices, which rose almost fourfold between the middle of
2021 and early 2022 and eight times from pre-pandemic levels, were particularly notable. In contrast, the
1970s crises were more concentrated in oil and, in the 1973 case, agricultural products.
Commodity supply disruptions have played a smaller role in recent price increases than in the 1970s.
Global oil production dropped by around 5% around the 1973 oil crisis (Graph A1.C). The decline in oil
consumption in AEs was even larger, at around 8%, due in part to embargos. Global oil production fell by
less around the 1979 crisis, although oil consumption in AEs again decreased substantially. In contrast, the
rise in commodity prices over the past year has been accompanied by a modest rise in the production of
many commodities, although not oil. That said, supply disruptions could intensify over the coming year.
The war in Ukraine will lower global production of agricultural commodities such as wheat and maize, as
well as fertilisers.2 Meanwhile, sanctions on Russian oil and gas would represent an effective reduction in the

supply of these products, where Russia accounted for around 12% and 17%, respectively, of global
production in recent years.
Aside from differences in commodity market behaviour, there are several reasons to think that the current
episode could play out differently to those of the 1970s. Higher energy prices, in particular, could matter less
for growth today than in the past. The energy intensity of GDP – the amount of energy required to produce a
given amount of goods and services – has fallen by around 40% since the late 1970s (Graph A2.A). The
5
reduction has been most striking for oil, for which consumption
has more than halved relative to GDP. To be
sure, some of this reflects a shift in energy use from oil to other fuels, such as gas, whose prices have also risen
recently. But even for gas, total consumption per unit of GDP is lower now than in the late 1970s.
The inflationary environment today is also arguably more benign. Although global inflation has risen
significantly since the start of 2021, this follows several years of low inflation (Graph A2.B). In contrast, the
1973 crisis took place against a backdrop of several years of steadily rising global inflation and signs that
inflation expectations were de-anchoring.3 Inflation was also generally high in the lead-up to the 1979 oil
crisis, albeit with substantial cross-country dispersion. The high-inflation environment of the 1970s may have
contributed to the large “spillovers” of rising oil prices to the prices of other goods and services (Chapter II).
The consequences of recent commodity price increases will depend on how policymakers respond. One
reason to expect more favourable outcomes is that monetary policy frameworks are very different. The 1973
crisis closely followed the collapse of the Bretton Woods managed exchange rate regime. At that time, the
goals and even instruments of monetary policy were poorly defined in many countries. Central banks today
have much clearer and more robust institutional frameworks. Even so, the path of real interest rates over the
past year, at least in AEs, bears a striking resemblance to that in the 1970s, with large declines in real interest
rates in the lead-up to the oil price shock in both episodes (Graph A2.C). In contrast, in the 1979 crisis real
interest rates were more stable in the face of higher oil prices and then eventually increased substantially as
central banks sought to bring inflation under control.
The conduct of fiscal policy will also matter. In AEs, many governments sought to cushion the blow to
incomes from the 1973 oil crisis with expansionary fiscal measures.4 The resulting increase in aggregate
demand added to inflationary pressures. In contrast, the fiscal responses to the 1979 oil crisis were generally
less expansionary. The backdrop to the current crisis is quite different, with budget deficits projected to
contract in most jurisdictions as governments withdraw stimulus deployed at the height of the Covid-19
pandemic. That said, a number of governments have announced tax cuts or expanded subsidies in response
to recent commodity price rises, as occurred following the 1973 oil crisis.

market participants brought forward their expectations of the timing of interest rate
increases, while the ECB gradually adjusted its guidance to raise the possibility of an
earlier policy tightening. The Bank of Japan remained an exception, maintaining its
highly accommodative stance.
Nominal policy rates generally increased by less than near-term inflation. As a
result, real ex post policy rates – ie adjusted for realised inflation – actually fell in
most countries, from levels that were already exceptionally low. In most AEs, at the
time of writing, real rates are 1–6 percentage points below their historical range
over the past three decades2(Graph 8.A). Real policy rates have generally been
somewhat higher in EMEs, but remain negative in most.
Fiscal deficits declined in most countries. Improving economic conditions
allowed governments to wind back some of the fiscal stimulus deployed at the height
of the pandemic. In EMEs, fiscal constraints loomed large and countries with higher
debt levels generally implemented larger fiscal consolidations (Graph 8.B). While
fiscal deficits generally shrank in AEs, governments in the United States and Europe
laid the groundwork for large infrastructure programmes in the coming years.

Inflation and war shape financial conditions
Higher inflation and the outbreak of war in Ukraine also left an imprint on financial
markets. Financial conditions tightened sharply during the review period, particularly
from the start of 2022, as asset prices responded to the prospect of rising inflation
and the resulting anticipated monetary policy tightening (Graph 9.A). The extent of
the tightening varied across countries and asset classes, reflecting their different
exposures to economic and geopolitical developments.
The consequences of the shifting macroeconomic conditions were first evident in
sovereign bonds. In the core bond markets, nominal yields rose sharply in
October 2021, particularly at shorter maturities. Long-term yields followed from
December as the Federal Reserve flagged an earlier and faster policy tightening,

before moving sharply higher after the start of the war in Ukraine (Graph 9.B). The rise
in US yields initially reflected higher inflation compensation, particularly at shorter
maturities. But real long-term yields also increased materially after the start of the war.
Indeed, in May the yield on 10-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities became
positive for the first time since the start of the pandemic (light red line). In the euro
area, German real yields remained deeply in negative territory (light blue line), despite
a jump in May as the ECB flagged an earlier rise in policy rates. Over the entire period,
however, the rise in German yields was due largely to increased inflation compensation.
Shifts in the shape of the US yield curve amid faster than anticipated monetary
tightening raised concerns about the economic outlook. Starting in October, the US
yield curve flattened as short-term yields rose by more than long-term ones. In
March, it briefly inverted, which is often seen as a signal of an imminent recession.
In the event, the inversion was short-lived and reversed sharply in early April. Such
a flattening was not observed in the euro area and Japan, reflecting their slower
pace of monetary tightening.
In EMEs, sovereign yields also increased alongside inflation. Initially, they rose
more in Latin America, where inflationary pressures were strongest and many
central banks had already started tightening policy early in 2021 (Graph 9.C). The
increase of sovereign yields in eastern Europe accelerated after the outbreak of war
in Ukraine, reflecting these countries’ greater exposures to the conflict. Asian
economies generally saw smaller sovereign yield increases, as inflation was slower
to gain momentum in the region. In China, yields declined, as policymakers wrestled
with the fallout of a troubled real estate sector and renewed Covid outbreaks.
Tighter US financial conditions spilled over globally through an appreciation of
the US dollar. The appreciation proceeded in two steps. The first, lasting from late
2021 to March 2022, was gradual, reflecting evolving inflationary concerns and
expectations that monetary tightening would proceed more quickly in the United
States than in other AEs (Graph 10.A). EME exchange rate movements were more

the full repricing of riskier debt.

Equity markets saw large fluctuations amid broad sectoral divergences. Stock
prices generally rose in the first half of the review period, albeit with bouts of
volatility as higher inflation and Omicron rattled investor sentiment (Graph 11.B).
They then fell significantly in 2022 in the wake of the Federal Reserve’s tightening
shift and the expectation that other central banks would follow suit, as well as the
outbreak of the war. In most regions, valuations declined, although they generally
remained above their post-GFC medians (Graph 11.C).
Chinese equities were an important exception. They drifted down from early
2022, as problems in the real estate sector lingered and Covid-related lockdowns
intensified (Graph 11.B). The rout accelerated after the beginning of the war, with
Chinese assets – both stocks and bonds – seeing large outflows, leaving valuations
at post-GFC troughs (Graph 11.C).

Stagflation: how high are the risks?
Although global growth was generally resilient over the review period, downside
risks loom large. To a great extent, this reflects the unique nature of the Covid
recession and subsequent expansion, which has led to higher inflationary pressures
alongside elevated financial vulnerabilities, notably high indebtedness against a
backdrop of surging house prices. This combination is historically unprecedented.
Prior to the mid-1980s, recessions were generally preceded by high inflation and
the associated monetary tightening while the financial system was largely repressed.
Since then, Covid aside, recessions have typically followed financial cycle peaks,
with inflation remaining subdued during expansions and hence calling for relatively
little monetary policy tightening.

BIS Annual Economic Report 2022

The absence of historical parallels makes for a highly uncertain outlook. At a
minimum, a spell of below-trend growth will be required to return inflation to
acceptable levels. But a modest slowdown may not be enough. Lowering inflation
could involve significant output costs, as after the “Great Inflation” of the 1970s.
Even then, inflation may not fall quickly, given the intensity of recent price pressures.
In a worst case scenario, the global economy could be set for a period of stagflation,
involving both low growth, if not an outright recession, and high inflation.
How could such a stagflationary situation arise? The entrenchment of recent
high inflationary outcomes, reinforced by rising commodity prices, would be a
natural starting point. High commodity prices could also weigh on global growth,
as would a significant slowdown in the Chinese economy. Financial stress could
magnify the growth slowdown. EMEs are especially exposed.

A new inflation era?
Inflation regimes have self-reinforcing properties (Chapter II). Just as low inflation
helped to moderate wage and price rises before the pandemic, so recent high
inflation outcomes may lead to behavioural changes that could entrench it. Such a
shift is most likely if an inflation rise is large and persistent enough – ie salient – to
leave a large imprint on the lives of workers and firms, and if they have sufficient
bargaining and pricing power to trigger a wage-price spiral.
There are several indications that recent inflation increases have been salient.
For instance, internet searches for the price of petrol surged in early March
(Graph 12.A). And measures of inflation expectations, for both households and
financial market participants, have started to increase (Graph 12.B).
At the same time, the conditions for faster wage and price growth look to be in
place. Real wages grew unusually slowly over the past year, and declined in some

jurisdictions, even as labour market conditions were remarkably tight, with job
vacancy rates well above their historical averages and unemployment rates low
(Graph 12.C). In part, this reflects the fact that wages tend to be negotiated
infrequently, and so naturally take time to respond when inflation increases
unexpectedly. As existing wage agreements expire, workers are likely to seek larger
wage rises. In some countries they have already secured wage indexation clauses to
guard against future inflation surprises.9 Meanwhile, the recent broadening of
inflation pressures suggests that many firms have greater pricing power than they
had pre-pandemic.

The war in Ukraine
The war in Ukraine adds to the inflationary pressures. The primary channel is
through higher commodity prices, particularly for oil, gas, agricultural products and
fertilisers, of which Russia and Ukraine are significant producers (Graph 13.A). Some
of these price rises – eg for oil and wheat – will feed directly into inflation. EMEs will
be hit harder than AEs, given the typically larger share of food and energy in
consumption baskets (Graph 13.B). Exchange rate appreciations may reduce
imported price pressures for commodity-exporting EMEs, although this relationship
appears to have weakened since the start of the pandemic (Graph 13.C). Other
price rises, eg for metals, will raise firms’ production costs and could intensify price
pressures through global value chains.
The net effect of these factors could be material, particularly as inflation is
already high. Estimates of the effect of commodity price increases across a broad
panel of countries indicate that a 30% increase in oil prices, combined with a 10%
rise in agricultural prices – roughly in line with those seen since the start of the
year – has historically been associated with a 1 percentage point increase in
inflation in the following year (Graph 14.A).10 For European countries, where gas
prices have surged even more than oil prices, the effects could be larger.

Some of the factors contributing to China’s growth slowdown are structural,
and hence likely to be long-lasting. China’s working age population, which peaked
in the early 2010s, will decline further in the coming years. Meanwhile, the potential
for further productivity gains from incorporating pre-existing technology and
reallocating labour to higher-productivity activities has diminished. The slowdown
in labour productivity growth as China has approached the technology frontier is
broadly comparable with those of Japan and Korea in previous decades (Graph 15.A).
This suggests that a return to very high productivity growth rates is unlikely.
A prolonged downturn in the financial cycle would exert a further drag on growth.
Against a backdrop of high debt levels, the influence of financial factors was already
evident in the year under review. In response to the further build-up of corporate debt
during the pandemic, and the continued high leverage of property developers,
Chinese authorities introduced several measures to reduce real estate vulnerabilities in
the second half of 2021 (Graphs 15.B and 15.C). These cut developers’ ability to
borrow, leading some to delay debt payments and shed assets, and curtailed mortgage
lending to households. Such measures enhance the sustainability of growth over the
longer run but dampen growth in the near term (Box B). Indeed, the relaxation of
some measures in early 2022 highlights the authorities’ difficult balancing act.
Pandemic-related developments exacerbate near-term headwinds. Local
lockdowns and other measures to enforce the authorities’ strict Covid policy
could further disrupt production networks, both within China and with trading
partners.15 The fight against the virus is far from over.

by the policy response to the pandemic, has left firms and households in many
countries highly indebted and has contributed to elevated asset prices, especially
for property. Unusually, these vulnerabilities did not decline materially during the
Covid recession. Indeed, in most countries private debt levels, particularly for the
non-financial corporate sector, rose substantially (Graph 16.A).
The coexistence of elevated financial vulnerabilities and high inflation globally
makes the current conjuncture unique for the post-World War II era. The tighter
monetary conditions needed to bring down inflation could cast doubt on
assets – including housing – priced for perfection on the assumption of persistently
low real interest rates and ample central bank liquidity. Even traditionally more
secure assets could be exposed. Bonds, for example, have provided a safe haven for
investors in the low-inflation environment of recent decades. During this phase,
bad economic times, when the prices of riskier assets like equities typically fall, were
generally met with monetary easing, which boosted bond prices (Graph 16.B). But
when inflation is high, economic downturns are more likely to be triggered by
tighter monetary conditions, causing both bond and stock prices to fall.
The effects of tighter monetary conditions would also be felt through higher
debt repayments. The largest strains are likely in countries where floating rate
loans – sensitive to higher policy rates – are more common (Graph 16.C). In this
regard, several small open economies look particularly exposed, at least in their
household sectors. For firms, floating rate loans are more common among riskier
segments. In principle, the aggregate savings built up early in the pandemic could
provide buffers for households and firms to cope with higher rates, at least initially.
However, the incidence of higher savings may not match that of debt burdens.
The consequences of these vulnerabilities for economic activity will depend on
how high interest rates rise and how asset prices and debt servicing burdens
respond. Illustrative simulations based on historical relationships between financial
and economic variables can shed light on the key risks. Particularly in countries

The real estate sector’s evolving contribution to China’s growth

The real estate sector plays a major role in China’s economy. Residential investment increased steadily in the
first decade of the 2000s, and has remained elevated since, accounting for a much larger share of GDP than in
other major economies (Graph B1.A).1 The real estate sector has also contributed to China’s credit expansion,
leading the authorities to take actions to reduce leverage. Given the prominent role of housing credit booms
and busts in past financial crises and recessions globally, and the strong correlation between housing sector
downturns and recessions, understanding the contribution of real estate to Chinese growth, and its
implications for the outlook, is of first-order importance.2 This box highlights the sizeable contribution of the
housing sector to China’s slowdown over the past year.
The analysis uses province-level housing market data and relates these to country-level GDP.3 Since local
economic conditions exert a large influence on housing sector activity, province-level indicators can help
identify developments that national-level data obscure. Moreover, from a methodological perspective,
province-level data provide more variation in the variables that are being analysed, which helps to pin down
economic relationships.4
The relationship between the real estate sector and China’s GDP growth strengthened in the 2010s. While
province-level measures of housing activity, such as floor space starts, show no significant link with subsequent
GDP growth pre-2010, a significant link emerges after 2010 (Graph B1.B). This is consistent with the increasing
share of residential investment in China’s output.
Housing sector indicators can also help forecast GDP. In particular, a measure of oversupply of housing at
the provincial level – computed as floor space starts less floor space sold – signals lower GDP growth over a
two-year horizon (Graph B1.C). A similar relationship, albeit with the opposite sign, holds for floor space starts
and residential investment activity at a one-year horizon. These relationships capture the direct and indirect
effects of residential investment on GDP, eg from spillovers to other sectors, such as real estate services,
production of construction materials and home improvement-related retail sales.5
These results confirm that the slowdown in the housing sector is likely to have had a material effect on
China’s growth over the past year. To give a sense of the magnitudes, the estimates suggest that, if growth in
floor space starts and residential investment had stayed at their average levels in 2018–19, and growth in
housing oversupply at its 2018 level, real GDP growth (year-on-year) would have been some 1–1.5 percentage
points higher in 2021. That said, such estimates are by their nature uncertain, in part because they assume
that the relationships between the variables remain stable and that the causation runs exclusively from the

real estate indicators to GDP. Moreover, the model does not explicitly control for financial factors or changes
in housing market policies, including macroprudential measures, which are also likely to have contributed to
China’s housing market dynamics.6
1
For analysis on China’s housing boom, see Fang et al (2015) and Glaeser et al (2017).    2 See Jordà et al (2016), Leamer (2015)
and Kohlscheen et al (2020).    3 For detailed analysis, see Kerola and Mojon (2022).    4 Indeed, aggregated province-level
housing market indicators explain a larger share of the variation in China’s GDP growth than aggregate country-level
housing data; the opposite is true for exports and imports, where country-wide measures prove more informative. This
result is obtained by aggregating information from province-level data by principal component analysis and then
comparing with nation-wide indicators.    5 Accounting for sectoral linkages and spillovers by means of input-output tables,
Rogoff and Yang (2021) argue that the impact of the real estate sector on China’s GDP is close to 30%. In this comparison
as well, China’s real estate sector appears larger than those in other major economies.    6 See Kuttner and Shim (2016).

where a large portion of debt is at fixed rates, it will take some time for the interest
rates faced by households and firms to reflect higher policy rates (Graph 17.A
and 17.B). Despite these lags, average AE private sector debt service ratios (DSRs)
could rise by more than 1 percentage point by 2025, to their highest level in over a
decade, if central bank policy rates evolve as financial markets currently expect
(Graph 17.C). If rates were to mirror the larger 425 basis point increase in the federal
funds rate in the 2004–06 period, average DSRs could increase by more than
2 percentage points, reaching their pre-GFC peak.
In this environment, asset prices could come under pressure. According to the
simulations, the path of real house prices would resemble that around the GFC,
while the long post-GFC run-up in equity prices would start to retreat (Graphs 17.D
and 17.E). In contrast, if policy rates were to remain at their current levels, asset
prices and debt levels would continue to rise, implying a further build-up in
vulnerabilities.
Such shifts in DSRs and asset prices could have a material effect on economic
activity. The simulations suggest that the level of GDP in the average AE would be
about 1.5% lower under the market interest rate path than it would be if policy
rates were held constant (Graph 17.F). In the steeper “2004 tightening” scenario,
the level of GDP would be around 3% lower. Even these results may understate the
GDP response to tighter monetary conditions, which would occur against a
backdrop of historically high debt levels, whose effects on growth may be felt more
keenly when asset prices are falling, and the growth headwinds of the higher
commodity prices and enhanced geopolitical uncertainty described above.16
Naturally, the results of this simulation exercise are purely illustrative. In
particular, they are based on average historical relationships since the mid-1980s,
which may have evolved over the past four decades. The use of cross-country
averages also masks considerable variation in exposure to higher policy rates across
jurisdictions. And, even for individual countries, the simulations are subject to
considerable uncertainty. Nonetheless, they help to highlight key vulnerabilities
and give a sense of the orders of magnitude involved.

Financial system stress
Financial system disruptions could reinforce any slowdown in household and
corporate spending. Such disruptions could come from stresses in banks or non-bank
financial intermediaries (NBFIs). Consider the two sectors in turn.
An economic downturn against the backdrop of high debt levels would test
banks’ resilience. Credit losses are most likely to accrue in the medium term, after
rising policy rates have passed through into market rates and households and firms
have exhausted accumulated buffers.

The size of credit losses will depend on the degree of required policy
tightening. If macro-financial conditions follow the “market path” scenario shown
in Graph 17 until the end of 2024, past relationships suggest that expected bank
credit losses over 2025–27 would be close to historical norms across AEs, albeit with
considerable uncertainty (Graph 18.A). They would be larger in the scenario where
rates follow the “2004 tightening” scenario shown in Graph 17, somewhat closer to
those experienced in the GFC (Graph 18.B). That said, stronger capital cushions
mean that banks are in a much better position to take the hit than they were then
(Graph 18.C).
Developments in NBFIs could pose greater challenges.
Financialised commodity markets are a key pressure point. These markets came
under strain when the war in Ukraine broke out, as sharp rises in commodity price
volatility triggered large margin calls in derivatives markets. The frantic search for

cash to meet those calls briefly led to stress in dollar funding markets, as reflected
in the spreads to OIS of forward rate agreement rates (Graph 19.A). At the same
time, some futures markets saw substantial increases in initial margin requirements,
leading some commodity traders to stop hedging their exposures in those markets
and absorb price risk themselves (Graph 19.B). This, in turn, saw commodity end
users, such as airlines, face difficulties hedging their own exposures. While the
tensions ultimately eased, the underlying vulnerabilities could resurface if price
volatility spikes again.
Some sovereign bond markets could also face strains as monetary conditions
tighten. The unwinding of large central bank bond purchases will remove reserves
from the banking system and could prove disorderly, as the ructions in US repo
markets in September 2019 showed. Already, liquidity in US Treasury markets
diminished in late 2021 as broadening inflationary pressures led investors to
anticipate an imminent policy shift. Market conditions worsened further as the
review period progressed, with implied volatilities in fixed income markets near
historical peaks, particularly for short-term rates (Graph 19.C).
As well as market functioning, sovereign credit spreads could emerge as a
concern as central banks wind down asset purchases. Some European government
bond markets are a case in point, given very high debt levels and past experiences.
As credit risk is repriced, these worries could also have a significant impact on
financial institutions’ balance sheets, probably affecting both securities dealers – key
participants of the NBFI ecosystem – and banks, which hold substantial amounts of
government bonds in their portfolios.
A broader concern is that the extent of exposures among NBFIs, which could
transform stresses at individual institutions into more systemic disturbances, are not
well known. The collapse of Archegos Capital Management in April 2021, and the
attendant stock market disruptions, is a leading example. In that instance, not only
18
was the capital of Archegos largely wiped out, but several banks that provided it
with prime brokerage services also took significant hits to their own capital buffers.

While the fallout was ultimately contained, it nonetheless highlights the risks posed
4
by hidden leverage in loosely regulated corners of the financial system.

Emerging market economies
The risks discussed above pose tough tests for EMEs. This is despite improvements in
fiscal and monetary policy frameworks that, together with greater use of prudential
buffers and macroprudential tools, have made EMEs generally more resilient.
Challenges arise because, in some other respects, the starting point for EMEs is
worse than in the past. Many are facing tighter financial conditions against a
backdrop of high debt, which rose further during the pandemic (Graph 20.A). This
raises the prospect of increased capital outflows, which have historically accompanied
times of rising global interest rates.17 The rise in geopolitical tensions at the current
juncture amplifies such risks (Graph 20.B). For commodity exporters, the rise in
commodity prices counteracts outflow pressures. Nonetheless, a number of
sovereigns have recently seen rating downgrades (Graph 20.C).
Many EMEs are highly exposed to stagflationary risks. Growth prospects had
already deteriorated pre-pandemic, with potential growth rates on average
2 percentage points lower than before the GFC.18 In addition, in many EMEs pandemic
scarring is more evident than in AEs. By the first quarter of 2022, the median length
of full school closures due to Covid-19 had amounted to 29 weeks in Latin America
and 16 weeks in emerging Asia, compared with six weeks in AEs.19 Labour force
participation is also recovering more slowly. In Latin America, in particular,
participation rates in 2021 were some 2 percentage points below pre-pandemic
levels.20 Many EMEs are highly exposed to slower Chinese growth, especially
countries in emerging Asia and some commodity exporters (Graph 21.A). And, in

countries where vaccination rates lag, health and economic activity could be more
vulnerable to further pandemic waves.
Even if growth does not decline, higher inflation tends to be more disruptive in
EMEs. Since inflation expectations are less well anchored in some of these countries,
4
not least in Latin America, larger nominal policy rate increases are required to
control inflation. Surging food prices are also more disruptive. Sharp rises in food
prices have been associated with social instability and the imposition of export
controls in the past, with recent price levels surpassing those seen during the food
price spike of 2011 (Graph 21.B).21 And while regulated food and energy prices, and
the associated subsidies, will lower the immediate pass-through to headline
inflation in some EMEs, they come with a fiscal cost and can create economic
distortions.22 Combined with growing demands for social spending in the
pandemic’s aftermath, larger fiscal deficits could eventually feed through into
exchange rate depreciations and inflation (Chapter II).

Macroeconomic policy challenges
Recent developments raise a number of macroeconomic policy challenges. High
inflation is clearly a major one, further complicated by the fragile growth outlook
and financial vulnerabilities. In such an environment, it could be difficult to achieve a
soft landing, ie bringing inflation sustainably back to target without sharply
restraining the expansion. At the same time, the need to rebuild both monetary and
fiscal buffers over the medium term, which has been clear for a long time, remains
pressing. The current environment creates an opportunity for sustained monetary
policy normalisation, but complicates the task for fiscal policy. Indeed, achieving
policy normalisation over the medium term and improving macroeconomic
performance more generally will require less reliance on macroeconomic stabilisation

policy to sustain growth and a renewed drive to strengthen the productive capacity
of the economy.

Controlling inflation
The most pressing challenge for central banks is to restore low and stable inflation
without, if possible, inflicting serious damage to the economy. At least in AEs, central
banks have not faced this challenge for decades. Historically, achieving such a “soft
landing” has proved difficult, and the starting conditions are in many respects
unfavourable (Box C). In most countries, inflation rates are much higher than usual at
the start of a tightening cycle, and real and nominal policy rates much lower, which
suggests that a stronger tightening may be required to bring inflation under control
(Graph 22.A). At the same time, elevated asset prices and high debt levels mean that
the output costs of tighter financial conditions could be larger than in the past.
The prominent role of relative price changes in driving inflation complicates the
policy response. The standard textbook prescription is to “look through” this type of
inflation because the tightening required to prevent it would be costly.23 But that
prescription assumes that the resulting inflation overshoot is temporary and not too
large. In the light of recent experience, it is harder to argue for such a clear-cut
distinction. If relative price adjustments are persistent and higher inflation triggers
second-round effects, central banks have no choice but to respond.
Calibrating the response naturally involves a trade-off. Tightening too much
and too quickly could inflict unnecessary damage. But doing too little would raise
the prospect of a larger and more costly tightening down the road.
For much of the past two decades, central banks had exceptionally ample
leeway to lean towards a more accommodative approach. In particular, inflation
was generally at or below central bank targets, even where unemployment rates
reached multi-decade lows. Of course, trade-offs did not disappear. A decade or
more of historically low interest rates contributed to a build-up of financial
21
vulnerabilities and meant that central banks did not rebuild monetary buffers.

tightening, seems to be associated with differences in the likelihood of hard or soft landings. This suggests
that there is little to be gained in terms of output from a shallower and more drawn-out tightening path.
What are the consequences of a hard landing, beyond lower GDP growth? Hard landings are more likely
to be associated with abrupt stock price falls (bottom panel of Table C1). At the same time, they are more
likely to be followed by lower real interest rates, which often become negative. These findings suggest that
achieving a soft landing could be key to ensuring a sustainable normalisation of monetary policy settings to
allow buffers to be rebuilt over the medium term.
While the analysis above is silent about the underlying policy frameworks, there are a number of ways in
which they could increase the likelihood of a soft landing. Some relevant dimensions have seen notable
improvements in recent decades. For example, the greater use of macroprudential tools and larger financial
system buffers could weaken the relationship between credit growth and hard landings, by increasing the
resilience of the economy against shocks. Better anchoring of inflation expectations may reduce the required
policy tightening in response to inflationary pressures, through its stabilising impact on wage and price-setting
(Chapter II).
We do not consider the role of balance sheet, exchange rate or credit policies in policy tightening.    2 There is no standard
definition of a hard landing. The results are unchanged when one defines a hard landing based on the peak-to-trough GDP
growth following the end of the tightening cycle. The results are also similar when a horizon of two rather than three years
is considered after the end of the tightening cycle.    3 See Borio et al (2018).    4 Because most of the tightening cycles in
the sample occurred after central banks had adopted inflation targeting, or similarly credible policy regimes, the results
may understate the adverse effects of high inflation and de-anchored inflation expectations on the likelihood of experiencing
a hard landing.
1

The new inflationary environment has changed the balance of risks. Gradually
raising policy rates at a pace that falls short of inflation increases means falling real
interest rates. This is hard to reconcile with the need to keep inflation risks in check.
Given the extent of the inflationary pressure unleashed over the past year, real policy
rates will need to increase significantly in order to moderate demand. Delaying the
necessary adjustment heightens the likelihood that even larger and more costly
future policy rate increases will be required, particularly if inflation becomes
entrenched in household and firm behaviour and inflation expectations (Graph 22.B).

Policy normalisation
A second macroeconomic policy challenge is to deliver a durable policy normalisation.
As discussed in last year’s Annual Economic Report, this requires achieving
macroeconomic objectives consistent with central bank mandates and room for
policy manoeuvre. The pandemic and the war in Ukraine have highlighted the
imperative to hold buffers so that macroeconomic policy can deal not only with
inevitable, cyclical recessions, but also truly unanticipated events.
Such an outcome is by no means guaranteed. Even in countries where financial
markets anticipate rapid monetary tightening, long-term bond yields still point to
very low policy rates at the peak of the adjustment, often negative in real terms
(Graph 23.A). Few fiscal authorities project a material decline in public debt in the
years ahead, even though the constellation of real interest rates is substantially
below real GDP growth rates, thereby greatly favouring a debt drawdown.24 Indeed,
higher energy and food prices have been creating substantial pressure for more
government spending to ease cost of living pressures.
Some governments have already stepped up spending, and further expenditures,
often untargeted, loom on the horizon. Germany, the Philippines, Sweden and the
United Kingdom, for example, have announced cash transfers to vulnerable
households to alleviate cost of living increases, while France and Korea have
temporarily lowered sales taxes on energy products.25 Brazil and Turkey have cut
import tariffs on food. In Europe, proposed increases in defence expenditure could

also have a material impact on public finances. Commitments to address climate
change add further pressure on fiscal positions globally. And less visible fiscal
commitments linked to ageing populations loom large.
A major difference from previous years is higher inflation. In the near term, this
provides a pressing reason to normalise monetary policy. Moreover, the unexpected
inflation burst will erode to some extent the value of long-term fixed income debt.
Because it rose much faster than interest rates in 2021, higher inflation helped limit
the rise in debt-to-GDP ratios (Graph 23.B). However, surprise inflation is not a
mechanism that fiscal or monetary authorities can or should rely on to control
public debt over the medium term. If it occurred repeatedly, unexpected inflation
could make investors demand a sizeable risk premium. And higher interest rates
will make fiscal policy normalisation harder.
The large stocks of government debt held by central banks complicate matters.
As explained in last year’s Annual Economic Report, they increase the sensitivity of
overall fiscal positions to higher rates. In effect, they transform long-term fixed
income debt into debt indexed at the overnight rate (the interest rate on bank
reserves). The effect can be quite large. Where central banks have used such
purchases more extensively, some 30–50% of public debt in the large AE
jurisdictions is in effect overnight.26
The general picture brings into sharp focus the tensions between fiscal and
monetary policy along the normalisation path. These could heighten the pressure
on central banks to keep their stance more accommodative than appropriate and
delay the already lengthy return of central bank balance sheets to more normal
levels (Graph 23.C). This puts a premium on institutional arrangements that
safeguard central bank independence and a clear emphasis on the primacy of low
and stable inflation as the core monetary policy objective.
Central banks have some options to influence the likelihood of a successful
policy normalisation. Choices about the pace and timing of policy tightening, as

well as the sequencing of balance sheet adjustment and interest rate increases,
could all influence the smoothness of the process. Effective communication is
critical. Here, central banks face a trade-off between forward guidance and
flexibility. Setting clear guidelines and benchmarks for policy normalisation could
help steer financial markets and reduce disruptions as interest rates rise. But if
forward guidance is interpreted as a degree of pre-commitment, it can curtail the
central banks’ flexibility to respond to evolving conditions. This flexibility is essential.

Rebooting the supply side
The experience of the past year, ranging from supply chain bottlenecks to
conflict-induced stagflationary pressures, reinforces the importance of reigniting
growth-friendly expenditure, in particular investment, and supply-side reforms.
These could raise growth and make it more resilient, thus facilitating the
normalisation of monetary and fiscal policies over time. To the extent that some of
the measures will involve carefully targeted expenditure increases that provide
benefits only further down the road, in an environment of limited fiscal space, there
is also a premium on making the tax system more growth-friendly.
As one of the most urgent tasks, the green transition calls for targeted
measures to put in place a more durable and sustainable energy mix. Simulations
suggest that an orderly transition that features a timely increase in green energy
investment could impose relatively small near-term costs and deliver persistent
long-term gains, measured in terms of economic output (Graph 24.A). By
contrast, a disorderly shift, where the adoption of clean energy technology lags
but carbon-intensive energy sources are shut down rapidly, would involve
significant costs in both the short and long run. The war in Ukraine has sharpened

the focus on energy security, which, especially over the longer run, is consistent
with the push to “green” the economy. That said, in the near term, energy security
considerations are likely to delay the green transition in some countries by
increasing the demand for coal and shale gas, for example. Moreover, the near-term
transition costs could be higher than conventionally assumed and may create
additional fiscal burdens.
To raise sustainable growth, and where fiscal space allows, many countries
could benefit from increased spending on human and physical capital. Increased
and better targeted education spending would help compensate for losses in
schooling and skills during the pandemic, especially in countries with lower income
levels. Pre-pandemic, the average length of schooling was around five years
shorter in emerging Asia (eight years) than in AEs (13 years); in Latin America, the
difference from AEs was around four years.27 As to physical capital, investment to
improve the state of public infrastructure, if carefully chosen and effectively
implemented, could make economies better prepared to deal with any future
shocks, be they health or natural disasters, and support the smooth functioning of
global trade.28
Another priority is to maintain competitive and open markets and avoid real
and financial fragmentation, especially in the face of geopolitical tensions and
surging food prices. Lowering barriers to firm entry and competition would help
accommodate pandemic-induced shifts in consumer preferences and lift businesses
closer to the productivity frontier (Graph 24.B). Recent years have seen an increase
in restrictive trade measures, and high food prices raise the risk of further export
restrictions (Graph 24.C). In the aftermath of the pandemic and in response to rising
geopolitical risk, supply chains are likely to see some adjustments, including
reshoring, aimed in part at increasing their resilience. While some of these
adjustments are necessary and desirable, it will be important to fend off growing
impulses in favour of nationalism and fragmentation, given the importance of trade
for global growth and productivity.

More generally, the need for structural reforms underscores that higher and
durable growth cannot be achieved only through macroeconomic stabilisation
policies. The repeated and systematic use of such policies over the past decade in
the face of economic weakness, combined with difficulties in rebuilding buffers in
good times, is one reason why the room for macroeconomic policy manoeuvre has
declined so much over time. A change in direction is urgently needed.

II. Inflation: a look under the hood

Key takeaways
•

To better understand inflation, it is key to go beyond aggregate analysis in order to separate relative
from generalised price changes and examine their joint dynamics.

•

Periods of high and low inflation are very different, notably with respect to their self-stabilising
properties and how firms and workers respond to relative price shifts.

•

Preserving a low inflation environment is paramount and requires ensuring that relative price
changes do not translate into entrenched inflation. Transitions from low- to high-inflation regimes
are especially challenging because they tend to be self-reinforcing.

•

Monetary policy has an essential role to play in ensuring the durability of a low-inflation regime
through the features of its operating framework as well as through flexible and timely adjustments
in the policy stance.

Introduction
The recent remarkable surge in inflation after its long quiescence has raised
pressing questions about the dynamics of inflation more generally. In the process, it
has put the spotlight on the importance of sector-specific developments including
the persistent pandemic-induced shift from services to goods; sectoral bottlenecks
in global value chains; and soaring food and energy prices (see Chapter I). An
urgent question is whether higher inflation will become entrenched.
These developments have underscored the need to go beyond the aggregate
dynamics of inflation in order to shed further light on how its engine works, ie to
look “under the hood”.
What does this mean, concretely? Many workhorse models of inflation build on
a Phillips curve relationship between inflation and economic activity. Taking this
approach, inflation fluctuations reflect aggregate demand pressures on productive
capacity, temporary supply shocks and changes in inflation expectations. Looking
under the hood complements this perspective. It distinguishes clearly between a
multitude of relative price changes and underlying inflation itself. It examines in
detail how, and under which conditions, such relative price changes can morph into
broader-based inflation. And it pays close attention to the wage-price formation
process – the core of the inflation engine – illuminating how this depends on the
rate of inflation itself and how it is linked to inflation perceptions and expectations.
This also means going beyond the well known cyclical drivers of inflation to examine
the structural influences on wage- and price-setting. These are often global in nature.
The distinction between relative price changes and underlying inflation is
critical. Relative price changes reflect those in individual items, all else equal. This
may or may not be related to underlying inflation, ie a broader-based and largely
synchronous increase in the prices of goods and services that erodes the value of
money and devalues the “unit of account” over time.

Looking under the hood reveals some important features of the inflation process.
Low-inflation regimes turn out to be very different from high-inflation
ones.1 When inflation settles at a low level, it mainly reflects changes in sector-specific
prices and exhibits certain self-equilibrating properties. Changes in inflation become
less sensitive to relative price shocks, and wage and price dynamics are less closely
linked. Moreover, there is evidence that the impact of changes in the monetary
policy stance becomes less powerful.
Transitions from low- to high-inflation regimes tend to be self-reinforcing. As
inflation rises, it naturally becomes more of a focal point for agents and induces
behavioural changes that tend to entrench it, notably by influencing wage and price
dynamics. This puts a premium on better understanding how transitions work in
order to be able to identify them early enough as events unfold. The transition from
a low- to a high-inflation regime in the late 1960s and early 1970s illustrates some
of the possible forces at play. These include large and persistent relative price
increases – notably oil – in a context of strong cyclical demand and in an environment
structurally conducive to wage-price spirals, ie high pricing power of labour and
firms coupled with the loss of the monetary anchor provided by the Bretton Woods
system.
Monetary policy plays a key role in establishing and hardwiring a low-inflation
regime and in avoiding transitions to a high-inflation one. Once a low-inflation
regime is established, monetary policy can afford to be more flexible and tolerate
more persistent, if moderate, deviations of inflation from targets. Having gained
precious credibility, it can reap the benefits. At the same time, monetary policy must
ensure that the regime is not jeopardised. It is one thing to tolerate moderate
deviations from point targets; it is quite another to put the system’s self-equilibrating
properties to the test. The costs of bringing inflation back under control can be very
high. Calibrating policy to prevent transitions is especially challenging.
This chapter examines inflation in depth, from an under the hood perspective.
It starts by defining inflation and characterising its behaviour as a function of its
level, drawing on the disaggregated price data that underpin it. It then provides a
systematic analysis of wage- and price-setting behaviour and of how changes in
relative prices can give rise to inflation, facilitating transitions across regimes.
Finally, it explores the key role of monetary policy in securing a low-inflation regime
and preventing transitions to a high-inflation one.

Inflation: stylised facts
Conceptually, the term “inflation” encapsulates the notion of an erosion of the
purchasing power of money.2 Inflation can be thought of as a change in the value of
the numeraire vis-à-vis all goods and services. When looked at from this perspective,
in its purest form, inflation would imply a proportional and synchronous change in all
prices.3 As such, it would leave the relative prices of all goods and services unchanged:
only their prices expressed in terms of the numeraire would vary.
In practice, however, price changes are never perfectly synchronous. Different
goods and services have different adjustment speeds. This is because the process of
changing prices uses valuable firm resources and very frequent adjustments need
not be optimal, especially in the presence of long-term relationships between
buyers and sellers (“nominal rigidities”).4 For example, the prices of commodities
are much more variable than those of, say, manufactured goods and, even more so,
of services.
Therefore, inflation, measured as the change in some general and
comprehensive price index, will always reflect changes in relative prices in addition

42

to underlying inflation. Some measures of inflation seek to partly disentangle the
two, in a very rough fashion, most commonly by excluding the most volatile items.
This, however, still misses the rich nature of granular price changes, both transitory
and long-lasting, if not permanent. Longer-lasting ones tend to be driven by
structural “real” forces, such as changes in consumer preferences and relative
productivity trends.
From a historical perspective, focusing on countries with a long history of price
data, extended phases of high inflation have been relatively rare. The Great Inflation
of the 1970s is the archetypal example. High rates of inflation have also typically
followed wars. A look at cross-country historical data since 1870 (Graph 1.A) reveals
that inflation was low, although volatile, over the years of the first globalisation
era (1870–1914) but surged during World War I and World War II. In the aftermath
of World War II, most belligerents experienced high inflation for some years
(Graph 1.B). Again, the 1970s stand out for both the length and global reach of
inflationary forces.
Extremely high-inflation episodes, or hyperinflations,5 are even less frequent.
These typically follow periods of major political upheavals and a generalised loss of
confidence in institutions. The defining characteristics of hyperinflations are large
budget deficits that are increasingly directly financed by central banks (often due
to the inability to collect sufficient revenues via taxes). One consequence is spiralling
exchange rate depreciations.6 Telling examples include post-revolutionary France
and the aftermath of World War I in the Soviet Union and Germany. More recently,
some countries in Latin America experienced hyperinflation in the wake of the debt
crisis of 1982, while Russia saw an inflation rate of around 2,500% in 1992 following
the collapse of the Soviet Union.
The dynamics of inflation vary systematically with its level along a number of
dimensions, pointing to important differences between low- and high-inflation
regimes. In particular, it is well known that when inflation becomes durably low, its
volatility tends to fall, as does its persistence.7 However, looking under the hood at
more granular price increases reveals several additional striking features.

First, the reduction in inflation volatility at low levels of inflation is not due to a
decline in the volatility of individual price changes but rather to the decline in the
correlation between them. This bears a close analogy with the return on a portfolio
of securities: the variance of the return is overwhelmingly determined not by the
variance of the individual components, but by the correlation across them.
The mirror image of this stylised fact is that, once inflation is tamed, idiosyncratic
relative price changes rather than price co-movements explain much of the change
in the overall price index. Thus, the common component in the cross section of price
changes declines. This is best illustrated with the personal consumer expenditure
price index for the United States, for which a long time series of very granular data is
available. The common component explains a large share of the total variance of
inflation up until the mid-1980s, corresponding to the period when inflation was
high, but little thereafter (Graph 2.A). This relationship also holds for other countries,
for which the series are shorter (Graphs 2.B–2.F).
Second, and closely related, the degree to which individual price changes spill
over into inflation also declines as inflation becomes durably lower. For example, the

pass-through of outsize price changes to core inflation falls substantially (Graph 3.A).
The same is true of the pass-through to inflation of changes in prices that are
especially “salient”, either because of their pervasive role in production chains (eg oil;
Graph 3.B) or because of their weight in consumption baskets (eg food, especially in
EMEs). And the same holds for the exchange rate – the relative price of two units of
account – given its far-reaching impact on prices in the economy (Graph 3.C).8
Third, and consistent with the previous findings, the spillovers across all prices
tend to decline in low-inflation regimes. This is illustrated in Box A and Graph 4.A,
which documents the phenomenon for a group of advanced economies (AEs) and
emerging market economies (EMEs). The transmission of disaggregated sectoral
price changes to other sectors, measured by the share of the total variance that
these account for, is much higher and more pervasive in high-inflation regimes.
Finally, a more granular perspective sheds further light on the well documented
decline in the persistence of aggregate inflation in low-inflation regimes.9 It shows
that this decline is not just a by-product of aggregation, but also reflects less
persistent individual price changes. This is quite a general phenomenon, visible for
most sectoral prices across a range of countries (Graph 4.B).
Overall, these findings highlight important differences between high- and
low-inflation regimes. In a low-inflation regime, relative price changes, even the
salient ones, tend to fade away without leaving a noticeable imprint on aggregate
inflation. Hence, the regime is, to a certain extent, self-equilibrating. As such, it
tends to become entrenched unless subjected to major shocks that are not met
with a sufficient policy response. By contrast, a high-inflation regime does not have
such desirable properties and inflation becomes increasingly sensitive to relative
price shocks – including large exchange rate depreciations. It is therefore more
likely to increase further (see also below).

What explains the inflation process?
What lies behind these stylised price dynamics? How do relative price changes
translate into self-sustained increases in the aggregate price level? More generally,
what explains the inflation process?
Sustained inflation ultimately involves a self-reinforcing feedback between price
and wage increases – so-called wage-price spirals. Changes in individual prices can
broaden into aggregate inflation. And they can also erode real wages and profit
margins for very long spells. But, ultimately, they cannot be self-sustaining without
feedback between prices and wages: profit margins and real wages cannot fall
indefinitely. So, beyond the important impact of aggregate demand conditions on
wage- and price-setting, a key question is how changes in relative prices that pass
through to the aggregate price index (“first-round effects”) can trigger feedback
between price and wage increases (“second-round effects”).
To unravel this process, we need to go beyond the canonical stylised Phillips
curve. The Phillips curve provides a useful and relatively easy-to-grasp framework
but has a number of features that limit its ability to shed light on the forces behind
inflation dynamics (see Box B for a detailed discussion). First, by construction, and for
simplicity, it focuses only on an aggregate price index and hence leaves out sectoral
developments. While the framework can include some key relative prices, such as
those of oil or the exchange rate, these have only a transitory impact on inflation.
Second, the Phillips curve focuses on aggregate cyclical factors as the key
drivers of prices (and, implicitly, wages) and does not account for structural forces.
Third, inflation expectations are assumed to affect inflation directly, rather than
through their impact on individual pricing decisions.10 Moreover, the various
relationships are assumed to be invariant to the level of inflation. While this is a

Measuring price spillovers across sectors

Examining how shocks to prices in certain sectors transmit and propagate to others can help shed light on
how individual price changes are able to morph into broad-based inflation. One relatively simple way to do
this is to look at how shocks affecting certain sectoral price indices affect the variability of prices in other
sectors within a certain horizon.1 This box presents indices of price spillovers across different sectors. It does
so, first, in the context of sector-level personal consumption expenditure (PCE) deflators for the United States.
The analysis is then extended to producer price indices (PPI) categories, to see how the price changes of
inputs percolate downstream to those of final goods and services.
The key ingredient for the construction of the spillover indices is the generalised forecast error variance
decomposition (GFEVD) matrix.2 This measures the share of the variance of each PCE sector (the rows)
explained by shocks to each of the sectors (the columns). Graph A1 visualises this for a horizon of 12 months
for two estimation samples: the first includes the Great Inflation of the 1970s (Graph A1.A), and the second the
“Great Moderation”, beginning in 1986 (Graph A1.B). Consider, for example, the dark red square in the row
“Food services” corresponding to the column for “Food and beverages”: it indicates that the bilateral spillovers
from the former to the latter are sizeable, as one would expect. Obviously, the diagonal elements of the
GFEVD matrix explain the lion’s share of each sector’s variance. But these are in fact “own” shocks, and do not
correspond to spillovers across sectors, and so they are excluded from the heat map.
Going beyond bilateral spillovers, an index of total spillovers can be constructed by summing all the
off-diagonal elements of the GFEVD matrix. Given that the matrix in Graph A1.A (“Great Inflation”) has overall
darker colouring compared with Graph A1.B (“Great Moderation”), the index of total spillovers is higher in the
high-inflation regime than in the later low-inflation one, as was also reported in Graph 4.A in the main text.
Spillovers across sectors explain about 20% of the total variance over a 12-month horizon in the post-1986
sample, down from more than 45% in the pre-1986 sample.
By summing the elements of the variance decomposition in Graph A1 by column and by row, respectively,
one obtains a measure of the extent of spillovers “exported to” and “imported from” each of the different
sectors. These are visualised in Graph A2. Comparing directional spillovers across sectors between high- and
low-inflation regimes indicates that they have diminished and have become more concentrated in a few
sectors that remain strong exporters of spillovers, such as food and gasoline. This highlights their centrality in
driving overall price developments. In line with the finding that total spillovers are lower in a low-inflation

The results are presented in Graph A3. The GFEVD matrix can now be divided in four blocks. The top-left block
represents spillovers within PCE categories, and is conceptually the same as discussed above. The bottom-right
block instead displays spillovers within PPI categories. Its generally darker shading, compared with the top-left
block, indicates that spillovers among PPI components tend to be larger than those among PCE components. The
other blocks represent spillovers from PPI to PCE (top right) and from PCE to PPI (bottom left). Not surprisingly,
those from PPI to PCE are stronger than vice versa. Note that the columns of PPI items are ordered based on their
(increasing) degree of upstreamness,3 so that the darker shades appearing on the right side correspond to sectors
further upstream, indicating that they tend to be the source of stronger system-wide spillovers.
The methodology follows that proposed by Diebold and Yilmaz (2012) and Lombardi et al (2013).    2 The generalised
forecast error variance decomposition is constructed by first modelling monthly growth rates in sector-level PCE deflators
as a Bayesian VAR with six lags controlling for common, economy-wide explanatory factors such as economic slack,
inflation expectations and oil prices. Generalised impulse responses to shocks to each of the variables are then used to
construct the decomposition of forecast errors over a horizon of 12 months. For further technical details, see Lombardi and
Zakrajšek (2022).    3 The index of upstreamness is computed following Antràs et al (2012).

tenable assumption in a stable inflationary environment, it can be more problematic
when inflation is liable to shifts across regimes.

Wage and price formation
All this suggests that it is worth more closely examining the wage and price formation
process. This can also more clearly bring out the role of inflation expectations of
workers and firms.
There are many similarities in the way wages and prices adjust. First, both are
sensitive to the same cyclical and structural forces. Second, their adjustment varies
systematically with the level of inflation itself, helping to entrench the high- and
low-inflation regimes. Finally, both are deeply influenced by inflation expectations.
These factors play somewhat different roles. Cyclical and structural forces
shape the pricing power of workers and firms – in particular, firms’ ability to raise
prices when profit margins are squeezed and workers’ ability to obtain higher
wages when their purchasing power is eroded. Inflation expectations provide a key
incentive to do so. And the level of inflation influences both their ability and
incentives, not least because of its impact on structural features of contracting
arrangements and on the sensitivity of expectations to relative price changes.
Let’s consider in more detail the roles of pricing power and inflation in wage-price
formation.

Pricing power
The pricing power of economic agents is ultimately determined by perceptions of
the consequences of charging a higher price or asking for a higher wage. How will
customers and employers react? How will “competitors”, be these other firms or
workers, respond? Will firms see their profit margins or market shares squeezed?
Will workers lose their jobs? Explaining pricing power means explaining how cyclical
and structural forces exert their impact on wage and price dynamics.

Cyclical forces
Cyclical forces are those that have generally attracted most attention. The main
such force is aggregate demand pressures. When the economy is running hot, it is
generally more likely for labour to have their wage demands accepted and for firms
to have their customers tolerate higher prices.

The Phillips curve and inflation under the hood

The Phillips curve first emerged as an empirical relationship between wages and the level of unemployment
(Phillips (1958)). Since this seminal contribution, the empirical regularity has been extended to prices
(Samuelson and Solow (1960)) and further explored and broadened. It has now come to play a key role in
many macroeconomic models as the main device to explain inflation.
In its simplest, prototypical version, a Phillips curve relates inflation (typically for a broad price index) to a
measure of economic slack (typically the output or unemployment gap). When this reduced-form relationship
is brought to the data, it turns into a linear regression in which inflation is expressed as a function of a chosen
proxy for economic slack. The other elements in the model are a constant, representing the level around which
inflation hovers, and residuals, capturing temporary, if possibly persistent, inflation deviations from their mean
that are not explained by slack (“shocks”). More formally, a prototypical Phillips curve takes the following form:

π t = c + β ( yt − yˆ ) + et

π t = c + β ( yt − yˆ ) + et

Such a framework is obviously too stylised to provide a faithful representation of inflation. Thus, the most

sensitivity of prices to sectoral slack. For example, sectors may differ in their exposure to global conditions – the
tradeable/non-tradeable distinction is an obvious example. And even differences across purely domestic
sectors can matter, as highlighted by the post-Covid developments.
In addition, there is a lot that can be learnt about the dynamics of inflation from the behaviour of
individual prices. A valuable insight is the much bigger role of (mostly transitory) idiosyncratic or relative price
changes when inflation settles at a low level. The importance of secular relative price trends is another, most
prominently the long-term increase in the price of non-tradeables, including many services, relative to that of
tradeables, which are mainly goods.
The other implications are more closely related to the wage- and price-setting mechanisms and their
interactions. These are at the very heart of the inflation process but are necessarily glossed over in the Phillips
curve representation.
First, the framework considers explicitly only the cyclical forces that influence the pricing power of labour
and firms, working through economic slack. As a result, it obscures the role of structural factors. Notable
examples include globalisation, technology, demographics and other features of labour and product markets.
Second, inflation expectations affect inflation directly. One implication is that there is no role for attempts
to recoup losses in purchasing power, or to compensate for squeezes in profit margins. In other words, unless
inflation expectations adjust, bygones are bygones, so that wage-price spirals cannot occur.
Third, there is no role for shocks to feed into the wage-price process and generate permanent, or even
persistent, changes in the inflation rate. For example, a large oil price increase does not directly affect
economic slack, and hence the cyclical component of pricing power. Nor does it induce attempts to
compensate for losses in purchasing power or squeezes in profit margins.
Finally, there is no room for the level of inflation to systematically influence its dynamics. For instance, the
response of wages and prices to slack or to changes in salient prices is modelled the same way, irrespective of
whether the economy is operating in a high- or low-inflation regime.
These omitted factors tend to show up as changes in equation coefficients. For instance, structural
changes that diminish the sensitivity of inflation to slack (eg globalisation, technology, a weakening in workers’
bargaining power), will result in a “flattening” of the Phillips curve, a well documented stylised fact.
One way of putting agents’ pricing decisions centre stage is to resort to “microfounded” versions of the
Phillips curve, that is, ones in which the relationship is derived directly from pricing decisions (see eg Roberts
(1995)). In these models, inflation results from the optimising behaviour of individual economic agents in the

of prices. These so-called “New Keynesian Phillips curves” describe a relationship between inflation,
st
inflation expectations and marginal production costs, mct ie

π t = E (π t +1 ) + κ mct

While appealing from a theoretical standpoint, such a version of the Phillips curve suffers from serious
mct shortcomings. As neither inflation expectations nor marginal costs can be directly observed, bringing
practical
a New Keynesian Phillips curve to the data requires additional assumptions. Marginal costs are typically
proxied using the output or unemployment gap, or even real unit labour costs. Inflation expectations can
either be estimated in a model-consistent way, or proxied using survey-based measures (eg forecasts of
inflation). So, even starting from the microfounded version of the Phillips curve, a researcher typically ends up
estimating a reduced-form relationship between inflation and a measure of slack that looks a lot like the
prototypical version described above. Moreover, the standard version only features a bundled consumer good,
and hence does not allow a role for relative price changes. And even in versions with multiple sectors, relative
price changes only reflect different adjustment speeds in prices, so that longer-run trends play no role.

That said, sectoral demand pressures, and differences across them, also matter.
Whenever sectoral imbalances take centre stage, aggregate measures of slack are
an insufficient indicator of the impact of cyclical factors on inflation. Given
differences in the strength of sectoral forces and in the response of prices to those
forces, a given measure of aggregate demand may be associated with quite
different inflationary pressures.
Probably the most important distinction in this context is the one between
tradeables and non-tradeables – one that has a long tradition in economics.
Tradeable prices are more directly exposed to external factors, including international
demand and supply imbalances and global financial conditions; non-tradeable
prices are more sensitive to domestic conditions.11 Of course, domestic demand
conditions affect the exchange rate, and hence have an important indirect impact
on the prices of tradeables.
The implication is that, as countries have become more open over time
because of globalisation, one would expect their inflation rates to have become
more sensitive to cyclical global factors as well.12 For individual countries, these
forces may show up as changes in relative prices, especially those of commodities.
Since these are often treated as “supply shocks”, there can be a tendency to
underestimate the role of aggregate demand in inflation whenever these pressures
affect several countries simultaneously.13
But the impact of the distinction between tradeables and non-tradeables goes
further. Just as in the domestic context, supply chains can act as a transmission
channel of global sectoral forces and facilitate their propagation. For instance, there
is evidence that the exposure of countries to global value chains helps explain the
relative importance of domestic and (suitably weighted) global measures of
economic slack, both across countries and over time.14
Furthermore, sectoral factors, domestic and global, can interact. Their
interaction has been very much in evidence in the unexpected recent flare-up in
inflation (Chapter I). The pandemic has induced a surprisingly persistent rotation
from services to goods, and the prices of many commodities have reflected global
demand pressures and dislocations in global value chains (“bottlenecks”), which
have made it harder for supply to keep up with the strong rebound in demand.

Structural forces
Structural forces have a major influence on wage- and price-setting. The previous
discussion highlights one channel through which they can influence the sensitivity

of inflation to domestic demand pressures, ie the openness of the economy. But
there are other examples, including structural features that may hinder the
reallocation of labour across sectors (eg the design of the pension system or
unemployment benefits).
The evolution of labour markets vividly illustrates how broad and deep the
influence of structural forces can be. Labour markets have seen major structural
changes since the Great Inflation of the 1970s. Their net effect has been to reduce
the pricing power of labour. This secular decline reflects many factors, including a
declining role of the public sector in setting wages; dwindling unionisation; a wave
of labour market deregulation; the gradual opening of markets due to globalisation;
and demographics. For instance, it is hard to imagine that the bargaining power of
labour, especially in advanced economies, could have remained immune to the
entry of large numbers of (predominantly low-wage) workers into the the global
trading system. China and former members of the Soviet bloc are the most
prominent examples. A quickening of technological change is yet another possible
factor, in this case increasing the competition between labour and capital.
Measuring pricing power is not straightforward. For example, it may not be the
actual entry of firms that determines their pricing power but the threat of entry
(“contestability”). Similarly, the actual extent to which jobs are relocated to foreign
countries may be less important than the threat thereof.
Again, labour markets can help illustrate the point. One possible, albeit
imperfect, indicator of labour’s decreasing structural pricing power is the secular
decline in the degree of centralisation of wage negotiations (Graph 5.A). Another is
the reduction in the number of countries adopting binding norms in the coordination
of wage-setting (Graph 5.B).
Based on these indicators, there is indeed evidence that workers’ bargaining
power is important in shaping the response of wages to both prices and economic

inflation to the unemployment gap increases, reflecting greater pricing power for any
given degree of tightness in labour markets.15 Moreover, workers are better placed
to successfully negotiate higher wages to reap the benefits of increases in labour
productivity as well as to recoup losses in purchasing power due to past inflation.

firms will initially try to make up for the erosion of purchasing power or profit margins
that they have already incurred. This, in and of itself, could trigger wage-price spirals
if background conditions are sufficiently favourable. And, once inflation becomes
sufficiently high and is expected to persist, they will also try to anticipate future
changes in the general price level, as these will erode purchasing power and profit
margins before contracts can be renegotiated.18
Fourth, if sufficiently high and persistent, inflation will influence the structural
features of wage- and price-setting. The higher the inflation rate, the greater the
incentive for workers to unionise, and for wage negotiations to be centralised, as
the inflation rate acts as a stronger focal point.19 And, the more persistent the
inflation rate, the greater the incentive to index wages and, more generally, to
reduce the length of contracts that are fixed in nominal terms.20 These forces are
amplified by the stylised fact that higher inflation rates tend to go hand in hand
with higher volatility and hence uncertainty.
There is considerable evidence supporting the impact of the inflation regime
on contractual arrangements.21 For instance, indexation practices tend to be more
prevalent in countries with a higher inflation history (eg in EMEs in Latin America
relative to those in Asia). And reliance on indexation has declined along with the
inflation rate (Graph 6.C).22 In other words, since the 1980s, structural forces and a
decline in inflation itself have arguably reinforced each other in reducing the
bargaining power of labour.
It is not hard to find the footprint of inflation regimes on wage- and pricesetting.
Consider price-setting first. As one example, across countries, the pass-through
from wages to inflation becomes more muted at lower inflation rates (Graph 7.A).
This finding is corroborated by US-specific evidence: unanticipated changes in
wages estimated over a sample starting in 1986 transmit less to both the producer

and consumer price indexes than they did in the preceding high-inflation regime
(Graphs 7.B and 7.C).
Similarly, wages have become less responsive to inflation over time. For
instance, corroborating evidence emerges from a simple empirical model in which
wage growth is a function of past inflation, the unemployment gap and labour
productivity growth estimated on a panel of advanced economies. Past inflation
has become less reflected in wage gains (Graph 8.A) as its average level has
declined over time (Graph 8.B).
Putting these various pieces of evidence together suggests that the link between
wages and prices has become looser. A statistical exercise that captures their joint
dynamics illustrates the point. When wages, say, fall behind their long-term
relationship with prices, they tend to subsequently catch up, although more slowly
in the low-inflation regime (Graph 9.A). The same holds for prices (Graph 9.B).
Taken together, all these findings may help explain why high- and low-inflation
regimes are self-reinforcing. This is largely through their impact on wage and price
adjustments and hence on the likelihood and intensity of wage-price spirals. In a
low-inflation regime, both the inflation rate and individual price changes are less
noticeable and the general price level is less representative of the prices that matter
for individual agents. Further, inflation expectations play a smaller role, and inflation
induces changes in structural features of wage- and price-setting that help keep it
low. High-inflation regimes are the mirror image.

Inflation expectations in financial markets
While the expectations of firms and households directly affect price- and wage-setting,
those in financial markets play an important indirect role through a variety of
channels.
First, they influence financial conditions and hence aggregate demand. A key
factor behind any decision to borrow or save is the interest rate, ie the amount the

borrower will need to pay to service their debt and the return to the saver for
postponing consumption. Apart from the short-term policy rate, which is set by the
central bank, the inflation expectations of market participants help determine
nominal interest rates at longer maturities, as investors need to be compensated
for the expected erosion of their purchasing power. In turn, expenditures are
shaped partly by nominal rates, which have a first-order impact on cash flows, and
by inflation-adjusted (“real”) interest rates, which reflect the real value of the
resources transferred over time. Long-term mortgage rates are a good example.
Second, through their impact on interest rates, the inflation expectations
embedded in financial markets have a major effect on the exchange rate – probably
the most salient and important relative price for open economies. This is because
they affect the returns across currencies, and hence the investment and borrowing
decisions of market participants that have access to both domestic and foreign
funds. These decisions will, in turn, be an important driver of exchange rates, as
sudden capital outflows can trigger large depreciations. Moreover, through
exchange rates, inflation expectations also affect the value of both assets and debts
denominated in foreign currencies. This is especially important in EMEs, where the
use of a foreign currency to denominate contracts can be common and where
currency mismatches – discrepancies between the currency denominations of assets
and liabilities – can be widespread.23
The impact on the servicing costs and debt burden of the government is
especially important. One possible mechanism is through financial market
perceptions of the sustainability of fiscal positions. For instance, there is evidence
from EMEs that when the share of public debt denominated in foreign currency is
high, an increase in the fiscal deficit results in a depreciation of the currency
(Graph 10.A). This depreciation is one reason why deficits, more generally, shift the
whole distribution of future inflation outcomes, increasing the likelihood of higher
inflation (Graph 10.B). This effect is stronger in EMEs, where debt sustainability tends
to be more of a challenge and the exchange rate plays a bigger role. The effect of
deficits on inflation is also bigger where debt levels are higher (Graph 10.C).

Third, financial markets’ inflation expectations are useful in and of themselves.7
While they may not be a good proxy for the expectations of wage- and price-setters,
they can help forecast inflation. After all, they aggregate the information of a
myriad of investors, who “put their money where their mouths are”. Moreover, their
timeliness can be of great value. And so is the fact that, through option prices, it is
possible to tease out information about the perceived risks around the average or
most likely future outcomes. To be sure, extracting inflation expectations from asset
prices is not without pitfalls. Since expectations are not observable, some “model”
is necessary to estimate them. Moreover, they are “contaminated” by the compensation
investors require for bearing inflation risk as well as by market characteristics,
including the underlying liquidity. Even so, at the end of the day, what matters is
their predictive content.
The empirical evidence indicates that financial market measures of inflation
expectations can indeed be valuable. While household expectations tend to be
biased on the upside when compared with those made by professional forecasters
(Graph 11.A), financial market expectations perform relatively well (Graph 11.B).
They also have the advantage of timeliness: in contrast to surveys that generally
take place regularly at fixed intervals, financial market expectations can be
monitored in real time. As such, they may prove especially useful when economic
conditions change rapidly.
The timeliness of market-based inflation expectations is one reason why they
are useful to central banks when setting monetary policy. As such, they serve not
only as indicators of the future path of inflation, but also as real-time gauges of the
credibility of the central bank’s commitment to price stability. Their use in this
context provides a valuable additional piece of information, although it needs to be
managed properly (see below).

Comparing different measures of inflation

Measuring inflation involves a balancing act between constructing a useful guidepost to assess price stability
(and hence inform central banks’ decisions) and identifying an index that is comprehensive, transparent and
easy to communicate to the public, whose experience of price changes it should duly reflect. Most price
indices are indeed based on the prices of goods and services in a typical consumption basket of a median
household. As such, they reflect the cost of consumption, rather than the cost of living per se.1
Central banks look at price indices partly to extract signals about imbalances between aggregate demand
and supply capacity that might require a monetary policy response. In addition, persistent movements in price
levels can serve as a warning indicator that inflation expectations may be at risk of de-anchoring. Yet, as
argued in the chapter, price indices mechanically reflect all price changes, including those that have limited
predictive value for future inflation, or are not influenced by monetary policy.2 In principle, monetary
authorities would like to react differently to different types of price change.
Some prices are particularly volatile and hence liable to be misleading. This happens for goods that are
more subject to large exogenous shocks, for example energy prices (eg due to conflicts or disruptions) and
food (subject to weather events and seasonality). These make up a particularly large share of overall
consumption, especially in some emerging market economies (Graph C1.A). One way to minimise their impact
on inflation is to rely on measures of “core” inflation that reduce the effect of specific components, by
excluding categories like food and energy that tend to be exogenously driven. Another is to rely on trimmed
measures that drop the most volatile components at each point in time, irrespective of their source.

The distribution of inflation outcomes, however measured, becomes much more concentrated around
low values when inflation is firmly in control of central banks (Graph C1.B). Under high-inflation regimes, both
core and headline inflation appear very volatile, while in a low-inflation regime core inflation tends to be
more stable, as one would expect.
A notable exception is the US Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) deflator.    2 Prices administered by government
agencies are an important source of prices not affected by monetary policy in some economies.

Monetary policy in a low-inflation regime
The dynamics of prices in a low-inflation regime offer considerable flexibility to the
central bank. In such a regime, inflation has valuable self-equilibrating properties.
Its evolution largely reflects changes in sector-specific, relative prices that are, for
the most part, transitory. Because of the lack of frequent and persistent salient price
changes that could drive inflation durably higher, agents need not pay much
attention to inflation. Partly as a result, wages and prices do not tend to chase each
other higher. Flexibility in this context could mean greater tolerance for moderate,
even if persistent, deviations of inflation from narrowly defined targets. It is as if,
having succeeded in bringing inflation under control, the central bank can enjoy
the fruits of its hard-earned credibility.
A low-inflation regime also confers flexibility regarding the specific measure of
inflation that the central bank can target. In an environment in which relative price
changes are dominant, and possibly disconnected from the dynamics of underlying
inflation, there is a premium on measures that abstract, to the extent possible, from
the most volatile relative price changes (see Box C for a detailed discussion).
There are good reasons for the central bank to make use of flexibility. For one,
with inflation low, supply side forces driving price changes become relatively more
important. These forces reflect natural adjustments in the economy that monetary
policy should accommodate, unless they threaten the low-inflation regime itself. In
addition, the evidence suggests that it becomes difficult for monetary policy to
steer inflation precisely. This, in turn, increases the possible costs of trying.
One reason behind the difficulties in steering inflation reflects the very nature of
the price changes. One would expect monetary policy to operate through the
common component of inflation, which tends to reflect the driver common to all
price changes. Empirical evidence supports this conjecture. Changes in the policy
stance have a persistent impact on the common component of price changes but
have little impact on idiosyncratic elements in US data (Graphs 12.A and 12.B). Thus,
as the common component declines relative to the sector-specific one when inflation
settles at a low level, the traction of changes in the policy stance declines with it.
In addition, the evidence suggests that, at least when inflation is low, monetary
policy operates through a rather narrow set of prices. The results of an exercise on
US data indicate that its impact is statistically different from zero for only around
one third of sectors, even after three years (Graph 12.C). Not surprisingly perhaps,
the prices that exhibit a response are mainly in the cyclically sensitive services
subsectors, which are more affected by domestic than foreign demand.24
Another piece of corroborating evidence is that monetary policy loses traction
when nominal interest rates are very low.25 Because nominal interest rates and
inflation rates tend to move together, this implies more limited monetary policy
traction in low-inflation regimes. This loss of traction holds even after filtering out
the influence of other factors – the state of the economy, the level of debt and the
apparent trend decline in “equilibrium” real interest rates. Moreover, the effect
tends to intensify the longer interest rates remain low.26
The more limited traction of monetary policy at low levels of inflation means
that bigger moves in the policy instrument are needed to produce the same
inflationary effect, with larger side effects for the real economy. This has been in
evidence in the post-Great Financial Crisis period, during which central banks have
faced difficulties in lifting inflation back to target, partly owing to the structural
disinflationary forces at play. Hence the need to keep an exceptionally easy policy
stance for exceptionally long – the so-called low-for-long phenomenon. This has
been one factor behind the build-up in risk-taking and financial vulnerabilities
(Chapter I).

Transitions across inflation regimes
What about transitions across regimes?
1
Bringing inflation under control has generally proven costly. And the higher
and more entrenched the initial inflation rate, and hence the larger the required
disinflation, the greater the cost is likely to be. As the previous analysis indicates,
once wage-price spirals set in, they develop an inertia that is not easy to break.
Expectations of persistent inflation become embedded in labour contracts and
wage negotiations, requiring a larger reduction in aggregate demand, and hence
higher unemployment, to break the back of persistent inflation. Monetary policy’s
task becomes much harder. This is true not only from a technical standpoint, but
also from a political one. A broad political consensus that inflation must be brought
back under control would greatly help the central bank’s task. For example, it could
be instrumental in inducing trade unions to accept the abandonment of indexation
clauses, as it did in the 1980s.27 But this consensus may take time to form and, in
the meantime, central bank actions will inflict necessary near-term costs on the
economy.
Thus, a key challenge for the central bank is to avoid transitions from low- to
high-inflation regimes in the first place – to nip inflation in the bud. To be sure, a
low-inflation regime has some self-equilibrating properties, which allow a credible
central bank to enjoy a considerable degree of flexibility. But, if the system is subjected
to too much pressure, those properties vanish. The Great Inflation of the 1970s is a
case in point. This historical phase was preceded by several years of moderately high
inflation, which left the inflation regime vulnerable to the 1973 oil price shock.28
Once the oil price soared, inflation accelerated and entrenched the transition.
A tough test central banks face in this context is how to identify transitions
sufficiently promptly and reliably and then to calibrate policy accordingly. Both
tasks are clouded in uncertainty. The under the hood perspective sheds light on

BIS Annual Economic Report 2022

61

these challenges and points to ways in which they may be addressed. Ultimately,
though, central banks have little choice but to consider the broadest set of
information possible, both hard and soft, and form a judgment about the risks
ahead. The current environment helps illustrate some of these difficulties.29
A first warning indicator is large and persistent changes in salient relative
prices, such as those of energy and food. Large exchange rate depreciations play a
similar role. For instance, recently the war in Ukraine has triggered major increases
in the prices of energy and food, adding to previous upward pressures, in part
related to the broader rebound in global demand (Chapter I). To be sure, such price
increases are neither necessary nor sufficient to trigger a transition. But they do test
the self-equilibrating properties of the system and require special attention.
A common practice to deal with such price shifts is to exclude them from the
measures of underlying or core inflation, because of their high volatility. The idea is
to capture only the more long-lasting influence of the inflation path. One possible
drawback, however, is that it may take time for their effect to filter through.
The under the hood perspective suggests another, complementary approach:
looking more closely at the degree of commonality across all price changes. A
simple such indicator is the degree of spillovers across sectors based on rolling
windows. Adding just a few post-Covid observations to the long estimation period
indicates that spillovers have increased in several countries in the sample
(Graph 13.A). A more timely indicator, which does not require long estimation
windows, is an index of similarity of price changes across sectors. This measure
reinforces the previous message: monthly observations point to an increase in
similarity since mid-2021 (Graph 13.B).
A limitation of all such indicators is that they cover only short horizons and
that the underlying changes may not be long-lasting. A complementary approach,
therefore, is to consider inflation expectations. These provide a better sense of the
possible evolution of inflation at different horizons, at least as perceived by
economic agents. That said, as noted earlier, these indicators are not foolproof
either. Expectations of economic analysts may provide little information over and
above central banks’ own forecasts. Those of financial market participants may also
be excessively influenced by the central bank’s own assessments and credibility – in
these cases, they could even lull the central bank into a false sense of security.30
And those of households and firms tend to be very backward-looking. In the
current context, these indicators point to significant risks (Chapter I).
Econometric models, not least those based on stylised relationships like the
standard Phillips curve, are the main tool to make longer-term forecasts, beyond
one year. But they can only go so far. The reason is that they are less well equipped
to address turning points (Box B). In part, this is because they tend to assume that
relative price shocks, even if large, have only a temporary impact on inflation.
Additionally, they may have been estimated over a long, low-inflation regime. More
generally, it is because they have a hard time capturing the specific inflation
dynamics during transitions, in which the level of inflation itself can alter well
established relationships.
Ultimately, the most reliable warning indicator is signs of second-round effects,
with wages responding to price pressures, and vice versa. These can be especially
worrying if they go hand in hand with incipient changes in inflation psychology.
Examples include demands for greater centralisation of wage negotiations or
indexation clauses, or surveys indicating that firms have regained pricing power, as
part of broader changes in the competitive environment, as observed in some
countries recently (Chapter I).
This gives rise to a dilemma. Central banks may wish to wait to obtain the most
reliable signals and to avoid overreacting. But waiting until signals are unequivocal

a tipping point. This is particularly important given that monetary policy affects
inflation only with a lag. Thus the risk of waiting too long should not be
underestimated, especially after a prolonged period in a low-inflation regime. If the
central bank has not had to tighten significantly for a long time, it will be more
uncertain about the impact of the removal of accommodation. All the more so if, in
the meantime, there have been signs of aggressive risk-taking and debt has built
up, not least reflecting the very low interest rates that may go hand in hand with a
low-inflation regime. These challenges loom large in the current environment.
In fact, transitions may be reliably identified only ex post. Central banks,
however, have no such luxury. This puts a premium on flexibility and timeliness.
When faced with high risks of a transition from a low- to a high-inflation regime,
the costs of falling behind the curve are likely to be high.
In considering these risks, country-specific features and circumstances are
important. For structural reasons, some countries are more vulnerable than others
to drifting from a low- to a high-inflation regime. The previous analysis points to
several relevant features. A large weighting of salient items in the consumption
basket can make increases in the inflation rate more likely to stick. Weak public
finances and large currency mismatches, especially in more open economies, can
make the exchange rate more sensitive to deteriorating conditions and amplify the
damage a depreciation can inflict. Formal or informal wage indexation practices,

behavioural adjustments. The actions of those in financial markets could quickly
push the system beyond the point of no return. This suggests that, in economies
with such features, there is a premium on a prompt monetary policy response.
EMEs are more likely to fall into this category. Not surprisingly, central banks in
many EMEs have responded more promptly than their AE peers to rising inflation
over the past year.

The prominent role of the history of inflation in influencing transitions
highlights the importance of policy frameworks and institutions. They hold the key
to the credibility of monetary policy. Credibility is essential to anchor expectations
firmly and, more generally, to strengthen the resilience of the economy to
inflationary shocks. In this context, central bank independence is critical. It
reinforces the self-equilibrating properties of a low-inflation regime, thereby
granting the central bank time to assess the situation more thoroughly. And, even
more importantly, it shields the institution from political economy pressures that
would delay, or even prevent, the necessary remedial policy response.

Conclusion
Understanding the nature and the mechanics of the inflation process is fundamental
to the conduct of monetary policy. Looking under the hood at disaggregated price
developments and at wage-price formation in depth is particularly valuable. It
sheds light on how waves of broad-based inflation can arise and propagate from
sector-specific relative price shocks and on the relative roles of cyclical and
structural forces in determining the likelihood and intensity of wage-price spirals.
The analysis highlights major differences between low- and high-inflation
regimes and hence the criticality of transitions.
A low-inflation regime has significant self-stabilising properties. What is
measured as inflation is, in large part, the reflection of relative or sector-specific
price changes that tend to have a transitory impact on the inflation level. In such an
environment, inflation has little effect on the wage and price formation as it loses
significance as a factor influencing behaviour. Central bank credibility is instrumental
in hardwiring the regime and increasing its robustness.
High-inflation regimes do not have such self-stabilising properties. Inflation
becomes a focal point for agents’ behaviour and wage-price formation becomes
more sensitive to relative price shocks. Higher inflation, in turn, induces changes in
more structural features of wage formation, such as indexation and centralised
wage bargaining, which help entrench the regime. It also undermines central bank
credibility, further unmooring the inflation process. The experience with the oil
price shocks of the 1970s illustrates the mechanisms at work.
Because of the sensitivity of agents’ behaviour to the level of inflation,
transitions are self-reinforcing and hence challenging. They are challenging for the
models typically used to explain and forecast inflation, which are ill-suited to
capturing such behavioural changes. And they are especially challenging for
policymakers, because of endemic uncertainty and the possibility of tipping points.
The under the hood perspective sheds light on how monetary policy can best
secure a low-inflation regime. The perspective underscores the importance of
navigating the transitions and the associated difficulties. Transitioning back from a
high-inflation regime can be very costly once it becomes entrenched. All this puts a
premium on a timely and firm response. Central banks fully understand that the
long-term benefits far outweigh any short-term costs. And that credibility is too
precious an asset to be put at risk.

The word “inflation” emerged in the mid-19th century (see eg Bryan (1997)). At
that time, it was used to denote changes in the volume of notes and deposits
in circulation. Given the metallic standards of those days, the loss of purchasing
power, and hence changes in the overall price level, were termed ”depreciation”.
It was only considerably later that the term took on the current connotations
of an increase in the general price of goods and services. In his Tract, Keynes
(1924) defined inflation as “an expansion in the supply of money to spend
relatively to the supply of things to purchase”, while in How to pay for the war?
he consistently refers to “price inflation” (Keynes (1940)).

See Volcker (1983). The formulation of price stability used by Greenspan (1996)

not effectively alter business or household decisions”.

18

Plentiful evidence for this exists, especially from the 1970s and 1980s for the
United States, where contracts often included automatic cost-of-living
adjustments, and sometimes even promised large future wage increases,
regardless of inflation outcomes. For example, a 40-month contract negotiated
in May 1981 for US mine workers guaranteed average 11% annual wage
increases over the life of the contract: see Taylor (1983).

19

High inflation also polarises the political debate, as the allocation of its costs
becomes a relevant distributional issue (see also Chapter II in BIS (2021)). In
that context, public policies (eg with respect to the minimum wage, or public
sector wages) can often play an important role in amplifying, or short-circuiting,
wage-price spirals. For example, wage moderation (achieved through consensus)
was instrumental in several disinflation episodes throughout the 1980s – see
Pereira da Silva and Mojon (2019).

20

This is most evident during hyperinflations. Paradoxically, extremely short
contract lengths when inflation gets completely out of control allow
hyperinflations to be brought to an abrupt end, since they contribute to
lowering inflation persistence.

21

See eg Rich and Tracy (2004), Fregert and Jonung (2008) and Christofides and
Peng (2006) for US, Swedish and Canadian evidence, respectively.

22

Note that indexation still plays an important role in the adjustment of pensions.
While pensions do not directly contribute to inflation, since they do not reflect
the cost of production, they contribute to demand and hence the inertia of
price changes.

23

See eg Eichengreen and Hausmann (2010) and Carstens and Shin (2019).

24

Note that this is especially the case for large AEs. In smaller and more open
EMEs, a stronger transmission of monetary policy through exchange rate
fluctuations, and hence its direct effect on the prices of imported goods, will
arguably lead to a broader inflationary response.

25

See Ahmed et al (2021).

26

There are many possible reasons for this loss of traction. Low nominal interest
rates can harm bank profitability and hence banks’ lending capacity. When
interest rates fall towards zero, market participants would see less potential for
further cuts. Persistently low rates may create disincentives to address debt
overhangs, undermining efficient resource allocation and productivity as well
as creating so-called zombie firms. Last but not least, the effects of real interest
rates on consumption and investment could become weaker: low rates might
encourage people to save more for their retirement to make up for lower
expected returns and, at the margin, firms may not invest more once rates fall
below hurdle rates.

This is a “hall of mirrors” effect as suggested by Morris and Shin (2002). Markets
come to trust the central bank too much and the central bank, in turn, relies
too much on market signals.

III. The future monetary system

Key takeaways
•

A burst of creative innovation is under way in money and payments, opening up vistas of a future
digital monetary system that adapts continuously to serve the public interest.

•

Structural flaws make the crypto universe unsuitable as the basis for a monetary system: it lacks a
stable nominal anchor, while limits to its scalability result in fragmentation. Contrary to the
decentralisation narrative, crypto often relies on unregulated intermediaries that pose financial risks.

•

A system grounded in central bank money offers a sounder basis for innovation, ensuring that
services are stable and interoperable, domestically and across borders. Such a system can sustain a
virtuous circle of trust and adaptability through network effects.

•

New capabilities such as programmability, composability and tokenisation are not the preserve of
crypto, but can instead be built on top of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), fast payment
systems and associated data architectures.

Introduction
Every day, people around the world make more than 2 billion digital payments.1
They pay for goods and services, borrow and save and engage in a multitude of
financial transactions. Every time they do so, they rely on the monetary system – the
set of institutions and arrangements that surround and support monetary exchange.
At the heart of the monetary system stands the central bank. As the central bank
issues money and maintains its core functions, trust in the monetary system is ultimately
grounded in trust in the central bank. However, the central bank does not operate in
isolation. Commercial banks and other private payment service providers (PSPs)
execute the vast majority of payments and offer customer-facing services. This division
of roles promotes competition and gives full play to the ingenuity and creativity of
the private sector in serving customers. Indeed, private sector innovation benefits
society precisely because it is built on the strong foundations of the central bank.
The monetary system with the central bank at its centre has served society
well. Yet digital innovation is expanding the frontier of technological possibilities,
placing new demands on the system.
Far-reaching innovations, such as those in the crypto universe, entail a radical
departure. The crypto universe builds on the premise of decentralisation. Rather
than relying on central bank money and trusted intermediaries, crypto envisages
checks and balances provided by a multitude of anonymous validators so as to
keep the system self-sustaining and free from the influence of powerful entities or
groups. Decentralised finance, or “DeFi”, seeks to replicate conventional financial
services within the crypto universe. These services are enabled by innovations such
as programmability and composability (see glossary) on permissionless blockchains.
Such systems are “always on”, allowing for global transactions 24/7, based on opensource code and knowing no borders.

However, recent events have revealed a vast gulf between the crypto vision
and its reality. The implosion of the TerraUSD stablecoin and the collapse of its twin
coin Luna have underscored the weakness of a system that is sustained by selling
coins for speculation. In addition, it is now becoming clear that crypto and DeFi
have deeper structural limitations that prevent them from achieving the levels of
efficiency, stability or integrity required for an adequate monetary system. In
particular, the crypto universe lacks a nominal anchor, which it tries to import,
imperfectly, through stablecoins. It is also prone to fragmentation, and its
applications cannot scale without compromising security, as shown by their
congestion and exorbitant fees. Activity in this parallel system is, instead, sustained
by the influx of speculative coin holders. Finally, there are serious concerns about
the role of unregulated intermediaries in the system. As they are deep-seated, these
structural shortcomings are unlikely to be amenable to technical fixes alone. This is
because they reflect the inherent limitations of a decentralised system built on
permissionless blockchains.
This chapter sets out an alternative vision for the future, one that builds on
central bank public goods. This will ensure that innovative private sector services
are securely rooted in the trust provided by central bank money.
Scaling on the back of network effects, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs)
and retail fast payment systems (FPS) are well placed to serve the public interest
through greater convenience and lower costs, while maintaining the system’s
integrity. Decentralisation and permissioned distributed ledger technology (DLT)
can also play a constructive role, eg when central banks work together in multiCBDC arrangements. These innovative payment rails are fully compatible with
programmability, composability and tokenisation to support faster, safer and
cheaper payments and settlement, both within and across borders. In this way, the
future monetary system will be adaptable, allowing private sector innovation to
flourish while avoiding the drawbacks of crypto. Such initiatives could open up a
new chapter in the global monetary system.
This chapter is organised as follows. To set the stage, it first describes today’s
monetary system and the high-level objectives it needs to achieve, and to what
extent changes in technology and the economic environment have opened up
room for improvement. The next section discusses the promise and pitfalls of
crypto and DeFi innovations. The chapter then discusses a vision for the future
monetary system, built on central bank public goods. The final section concludes.

What do we want from a monetary system?
The monetary system is the set of institutions and arrangements that supports
monetary exchange. It consists of money and payment systems.2 What is required
from such a system to serve society? While there is no canonical list of necessary
features, a number of high-level goals stand out (Table 1, first column).
To ensure the safety and stability of the system, money needs to fulfil three
functions: as a store of value, a unit of account and a medium of exchange. Where
the monetary system relies on key nodes or entities (whether public or private),
they need to be accountable, through specific mandates for public authorities and
through proper regulation and supervision for private entities. The monetary
system should be efficient, enabling reliable, fast payments to support economic
transactions both at scale and also at low cost. Access to basic payments services at
affordable prices, in particular transaction accounts, should be universal to spread
the benefits of economic activity, promoting financial inclusion. Not least, the
system must protect privacy as a fundamental right, and provide user control over

should ensure that key nodes
in the system are accountable
and transparent to users and
society

Supervision, regulation and

promote competition and
protect consumers, but
public mandates may need
to adapt to change

Crypto and DeFi create a
parallel financial system to
circumvent regulation, with
no accountability to the

High congestion and rents
lead to costly transactions
and new speculative

4. Inclusion – the system
should ensure universal access
to basic services at affordable

Many people lack access to
transaction accounts and
digital payment instruments

Crypto and DeFi have not
yet served to enhance
financial inclusion

New service providers and

barriers to inclusion and
better serve the unbanked

5. User control over data –
data governance arrangements
should ensure users’ privacy
and control over data

Users trust intermediaries to
keep data safe, but they do
not have sufficient control
over their data

Transactions are public on
the blockchain – which will
not work with “real names”

New data architectures can

should avoid illicit activity such
as money laundering, financing
of terrorism and fraud

Payment systems are
subject to extensive

Pseudo-anonymity is prone
to abuse by illicit actors, and
the DeFi sector is rife with

financial data. The integrity of the system must be protected, by guarding against
illicit activity such as money laundering, financing of terrorism and fraud.
The monetary system is not just a snapshot of the economy as it exists today; it
needs to evolve with structural changes in the economy and society. For this reason,
the means of reaching the high-level goals set out in Table 1 should evolve with the
monetary system itself and the technology underpinning it. In short, the monetary
system must be adaptable: it should anticipate future developments and user
needs. It must be attuned to technological developments and respond to the
changing demands of households and businesses, and it must foster competition
and innovation. To better serve an increasingly interconnected world, the monetary

system also needs to be open, interoperable and flexible, both domestically and
across borders. Just as economic transactions transcend borders, the monetary
system will need to serve a seamless web of interconnected entities, rather than
sparsely connected islands of activity.
Today’s monetary system has come some way towards these high-level goals,
but there is still some way to go. Changes in users’ needs and the concomitant
shifts in technology have pointed to areas for improvement (Table 1, second
column). Current payment services can sometimes be cumbersome and costly to
use, in part reflecting a lack of competition. Cross-border payments are particularly
expensive, opaque and slow: they usually involve one or more correspondent banks
to settle a transaction, using ledgers built on different technologies.3 In addition, a
large share of adults, especially in emerging market and developing economies, still
have no access to digital payment options. But a globalised world that features an
ever-growing digital economy requires a monetary system that allows everyone to
make financial transactions domestically and globally in a safe, sound and efficient
way. Catering to these changes in the demands that society places in the monetary
system calls for advances in technology and institutional arrangements.

The promise and pitfalls of crypto
The crypto universe is in turmoil. The implosion of the TerraUSD stablecoin and its
twin coin Luna is only the most spectacular failure in the sector, with many lesserknown coins having seen a collapse in price of more than 90% relative to their peak
in 2021. Crypto commentators have begun to refer to recent events as the start of
a “crypto winter”.
As dramatic as these recent price collapses have been, focusing on the price
action alone diverts attention away from the deeper structural flaws in crypto that
render them unsuitable as the basis for a monetary system that serves society
(Table 1, third column).
The prevalence of stablecoins, which attempt to peg their value to the US
dollar or other conventional currencies, indicates the pervasive need in the crypto
sector to piggyback on the credibility provided by the unit of account issued by the
central bank. In this sense, stablecoins are the manifestation of crypto’s search for a
nominal anchor. Stablecoins resemble the way that a currency peg is a nominal
anchor for the value of a national currency against that of an international currency
– but without the institutional arrangements, instruments, commitments and
credibility of the central bank operating the peg. Providing the unit of account for
the economy is the primary role of the central bank. The fact that stablecoins must
import the credibility of central bank money is highly revealing of crypto’s structural
shortcomings. That stablecoins are often less stable than their issuers claim shows
that they are at best an imperfect substitute for sound sovereign currency.
Stablecoins also play a key role in facilitating transactions across the plethora
of cryptocurrencies that have mushroomed in recent years. At the latest count there
were over 10,000 coins on many different blockchains that competed for the
attention of speculative buyers.
The proliferation of coins reveals another important structural flaw with crypto
– namely the fragmentation of the crypto universe, with many incompatible
settlement layers jostling for a place in the spotlight.
This fragmentation of the crypto universe raises serious questions as to the
suitability of crypto as money. Money is a coordination device that serves society
through its strong network effects. The more users flock to a particular form of
money, the more users it attracts. For this reason, money has the “winner takes all”

78

BIS Annual Economic Report 2022

property, in which network effects lead to the dominance of one version of money
as the transactions medium that is generally accepted throughout the economy. The
fragmentation of the crypto universe points in a very different direction: as explained
below, the more users flock to one blockchain system, the worse is the congestion
and the higher are the transaction fees, opening the door to the entry of newer
rivals who may cut corners on security in favour of higher capacity. So, rather than
the familiar monetary narrative of “the more the merrier”, crypto displays the
property of “the more the sorrier”. It is this tendency toward fragmentation that is
perhaps crypto’s greatest flaw as the basis for a monetary system.
Nevertheless, crypto offers a glimpse of potentially useful features that could
enhance the capabilities of the current monetary system. These stem from the
capacity to combine transactions and to execute the automatic settlement of
bundled transactions in a conditional manner, enabling greater functionality and
speed. Thus, one question to consider is how the useful functionalities of crypto can
be incorporated in a future monetary system that builds on central bank money.
In order to develop the deeper insights on the flaws and possibilities of crypto,
it is instructive first to explain some basic building blocks of the crypto world.

The building blocks of crypto
Crypto purports to reduce the heft of intermediaries and has been described as a
broader movement toward decentralised finance and even a more decentralised
internet (“Web 3.0” or “Web3”). The touted benefit is to democratise finance,
granting users greater control over their data. Prior to the recent crash, the market
size of cryptocurrencies and DeFi had expanded rapidly (Graph 1).
Crypto has its origin in Bitcoin, which introduced a radical idea: a decentralised
means of transferring value on a permissionless blockchain. Any participant can act
as a validating node (see glossary) and take part in the validation of transactions on
a public ledger (ie the permissionless blockchain). Rather than relying on trusted

intermediaries (such as banks), record-keeping on the blockchain is performed by a
multitude of anonymous, self-interested validators.
Transactions with cryptocurrencies are verified by decentralised validators and
recorded on the public ledger. If a seller wants to transfer cryptocurrencies to a
buyer, the buyer (whose identity is hidden behind their cryptographic digital
signature) broadcasts the transaction details, eg transacting parties, amount or fees.
Validators (in some networks called “miners”) compete to verify the transaction, and
whoever is selected to verify then appends the transaction to the blockchain. The
updated blockchain is then shared among all miners and users. The history of all
transactions is hence publicly observable and tied to specific wallets, while the true
identities of the parties behind transactions (ie the owners of the wallets) remain
undisclosed. By broadcasting all information publicly, the system verifies that the
transaction is consistent with the history of transfers on the blockchain, ie that the
cryptocurrency actually belongs to the seller and has not been double-spent.
However, for a decentralised governance system, economic incentives are key.
The limits of the system are set by the laws of economics rather than the laws of
physics. In other words, not only the technology but also the incentives need to work.
Miners (or validators) are compensated with monetary rewards for performing their
tasks according to the rules so that the system becomes self-sustaining. Rewards,
paid in crypto, can come in the form of transaction fees but can also stem from rents
that accrue to “staking” one’s coins in a proof-of-stake blockchain. The larger the
stake, the more often a node will serve as validator, and the larger the rents.
Since the advent of Bitcoin in 2009, many other blockchains and associated
crypto coins have entered the scene, most notably Ethereum, which provides for
the use of “smart contracts” and “programmability” (see glossary). Smart contracts,
or self-executing code that triggers an action if some pre-specified conditions are
met, can automate market functions and obviate the intermediaries that were
traditionally required to make decisions. As the underlying code is publicly available,
it can be scrutinised, making smart contracts transparent and reducing the risk of
manipulation. An important feature of smart contracts is their composability, or the
capacity to combine different components in a system. Users can perform complex
transactions on the same blockchain by combining multiple instructions within one
single smart contract – “money legos”. They can create a digital representation of
assets through “tokenisation” (see glossary). As smart contracts cannot directly
access information that resides “off-chain”, ie outside the specific blockchain, they
require mediators to provide such data (so-called oracles).4
Newer blockchains, with Terra (before its collapse) being a prominent example,
have been touted as “Ethereum killers” in that they boast higher capacity and larger
throughput (see glossary). However, these changes bring new problems. Capacity is
often increased through greater centralisation in the validation mechanisms,
weakening security and concentrating the benefits for insiders, as explained below.5

Stablecoins in search of a nominal anchor
A key development in the crypto universe is the rise of decentralised finance, or
“DeFi”. DeFi offers financial service and products, but with the declared objective of
refashioning the financial system by cutting out the middlemen and thereby
lowering costs.6 To this end, DeFi applications publicly record pseudo-anonymous
transactions in cryptocurrencies on permissionless blockchains. “Decentralised
applications” (dApps) featuring smart contracts allow transactions to be automated.
To reach consensus, validators are incentivised through rewards.
While the DeFi ecosystem is evolving rapidly, the main types of financial activity
continue to be those already available in traditional finance, such as lending,

80

BIS Annual Economic Report 2022

trading and insurance.7 Lending platforms let users lend out their stablecoins with
interest to borrowers that post other cryptocurrencies as collateral. Decentralised
exchanges (DEXs) represent marketplaces where transactions occur directly between
cryptocurrency or stablecoin traders, with prices determined via algorithms. On
DeFi insurance platforms, users can insure themselves against eg the mishandling
of private keys, exchange hacks or smart contract failures. As activities almost
exclusively involve exchanging one stablecoin or cryptocurrency for another, and
do not finance productive investments in the real economy, the system is mostly
self-referential.
Stablecoins play a key role in the DeFi ecosystem. These are so-called because
they are usually pegged to a numeraire, such as the US dollar, but can also target
the price of other currencies or assets (eg gold). In this sense, they often import the
credibility provided by the unit of account issued by the central bank. Their main
use case is to overcome the high price volatility and low liquidity of unbacked
cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin. Their use also avoids frequent conversion between
cryptocurrencies and bank deposits in sovereign currency, which is usually
associated with significant fees. Because stablecoins are used to support a wide
range of DeFi activities, turnover in stablecoins generally dwarfs that of other
cryptocurrencies.
The two main types of stablecoin are asset-backed and algorithmic. Asset-backed
stablecoins, such as Tether, USD Coin and Binance USD, are typically managed by a
centralised intermediary who invests the underlying collateral and coordinates the
coins’ redemption and creation. Assets can be held in government bonds, short-term
corporate debt or bank deposits, or in other cryptocurrencies. In contrast, algorithmic
stablecoins, such as TerraUSD before its implosion, rely on complex algorithms that
automatically rebalance supply to maintain their value relative to the target currency
or asset. To avoid reliance on fiat currency, they often do so by providing users with
an arbitrage opportunity relative to another cryptocurrency.
Despite their name, stablecoins – in particular, algorithmic ones – are less
stable than their issuers claim. In May 2022, TerraUSD entered a death spiral, as its
value dropped from $1 to just a few cents over the course of a few days (see Box A).
In the aftermath, other algorithmic stablecoins came under pressure. But so did
some asset-backed stablecoins, which have seen large-scale redemptions, temporarily
losing their peg in the wake of the shock. Redemptions were more pronounced
among stablecoins whose issuers did not disclose the composition of reserve assets
in detail, presumably reflecting investors’ worries that such issuers might not be
able to guarantee conversion at par.
Indeed, commentators have warned for some time that there is an inherent
conflict of interest in stablecoins, with an incentive for issuers to invest in riskier
assets. Economic history is littered with attempts at private money that failed,
leading to losses for investors and the real economy. The robustness of stablecoin
stabilisation mechanisms depends crucially on the quality and transparency of their
reserve assets, which are often woefully lacking.8
Yet even if stablecoins were to remain stable to some extent, they lack the
qualities necessary to underpin the future monetary system. They must import their
credibility from sovereign fiat currencies, but they benefit neither from the
regulatory requirements and protections of bank deposits and e-money, nor from
the central bank as a lender of last resort. In addition, they tie up liquidity and can
fragment the monetary system, thus undermining the singleness of the currency.9 As
stablecoins are barely used to pay for real-world goods and services, but underpin
the largely self-referential DeFi ecosystem, some have questioned whether
stablecoins should be banned.10 As will be discussed below, there is more promise in
sounder representations of central bank money and liabilities of regulated issuers.

The collapse of the TerraUSD stablecoin

The implosion of TerraUSD (UST) highlights inherent fragilities in some versions of stablecoins. The use of UST
grew rapidly over 2021–22 so that, prior to its collapse, it was the third largest stablecoin, with a peak market
capitalisation of $18.7 billion. An algorithmic stablecoin, it maintained value by adjusting supply in an
automated arbitrage trading strategy with another cryptocurrency, Luna, on the Terra blockchain. UST aimed
to keep a one-for-one peg to the US dollar by being convertible into one dollar’s worth of Luna, and vice
versa. For example, should Terra fall to 99 cents, a user could purchase UST on an exchange for 99 cents and
then exchange their UST for $1 worth of new units of Luna on the Terra platform. A crucial aspect of this
arrangement was that users would only be willing to exchange UST into Luna if Luna’s market capitalisation
exceeded that of UST. As Luna had no intrinsic value, its valuation stemmed primarily from the influx of
speculative users into the Terra ecosystem. To attract new users, the associated lending protocol Anchor
offered a deposit rate of around 20% on UST. As long as users had confidence in the stable value of UST and
sustained market capitalisation of Luna, the system could be sustained. The Terra/Luna pairing was regarded
as being especially significant as it promised to offer a “self-levitating” version of money that did not piggyback
on real-world collateral assets.

Structural limitations of crypto
In addition to the immediate concerns around stability, crypto suffers from the
inherent limitations of permissionless blockchains, which lead inevitably to the
system’s fragmentation, accompanied by congestion and high fees.11 Tracing the
reasons for fragmentation is revealing, as these highlight that the limitations are
not technological but rather stem from the system’s incentive structure.

The striking fragmentation of the crypto universe stands in stark contrast to
the network effects that take root in traditional payment networks. Traditional
payment networks are characterised by a “winner takes all” property, whereby more
users flocking to a particular platform beget even more users. Such network effects
stand at the heart of the virtuous circle of lower costs and enhanced trust in
traditional platforms. In contrast, crypto’s tendency toward fragmentation and high
fees is a fundamental structural flaw that disqualifies it as the foundation for the
future monetary system.14
Despite fragmentation, speculation can induce high price correlations across
different cryptocurrencies and blockchains. Attracted by high returns and the
expectation of further price increases (Box B), the influx of new users can push up
prices even more. As many cryptocurrencies share a similar user base and are tied

concerns about what happens to a system that relies on selling new coins when the
new inflow of users suddenly slows.

The DeFi decentralisation illusion and the role of exchanges
Despite its name, the DeFi ecosystem shows a tendency towards centralisation.
Many key decisions are taken by vote among the holders of “governance tokens”,
which are often issued to developer teams and early investors and are thus heavily
concentrated. Smart contracts tied to real-world events involve oracles that operate
outside the blockchain. “Algorithm incompleteness”, ie the impossibility of writing
contracts to spell out what actions to take in all contingencies, requires some
central entities to resolve disputes. Moreover, newer blockchains usually aim for
faster transactions and higher throughput by relying on concentrated validation
mechanisms. For example, proof-of-stake mechanisms build on a limited number of
validators who stake their coins.
Centralisation in DeFi is not without risks. Increasing centralisation of validators
gives rise to incentive conflicts and the risk of hacks, also because these centralised
nodes are often unregulated.15 Further, those in charge of an oracle can corrupt the
system by misreporting data (the so-called oracle problem). Currently, there are no
clear rules on how to vet or incentivise oracle providers.
Centralisation is also present in crypto trading activities, where investors rely
mainly on centralised exchanges (CEXs) rather than decentralised ones (DEXs).
While the latter work by matching the counterparties in a transaction through socalled automated market-maker protocols, CEXs maintain off-chain records of
outstanding orders posted by traders – known as limit order books – which are
familiar from traditional finance. CEXs attract more trading activity than DEXs, as
they feature lower costs (Graph 5.A).16 In terms of business model and the way they
operate, crypto CEXs are not fundamentally different from traditional exchanges,
even though they are not subject to the same regulation and supervision.
CEXs have seen substantial growth since 2020 and have reached volumes that
make them relevant from a financial stability viewpoint (Graph 5.B). Moreover,

People invest in cryptocurrencies for different reasons, for example because they distrust domestic financial institutions,
for cross-border money transfers or for the potential for pseudo-anonymity – for either legitimate or nefarious reasons.
However, one of the main reasons is that cryptocurrencies are seen as investment assets. See Auer and Tercero-Lucas

Regulatory approaches to crypto risks
Regulatory action is needed to address the immediate risks in the crypto monetary
system and to support public policy goals.
Above all, authorities need to rigorously tackle cases of regulatory arbitrage.
Starting from the principle of “same activity, same risk, same rules”, they should
ensure that crypto and DeFi activities comply with legal requirements for
comparable traditional activities. Stablecoin issuers, for instance, resemble deposit-

BIS Annual Economic Report 2022

87

takers or money market funds (MMFs). As such, legislation is needed to qualify
these activities and ensure that they are subject to sound prudential regulation and
disclosure. For systemically important stablecoins issuers, there must be robust
oversight. Where stablecoins are issued by large entities with extensive networks
and user data, entity-based requirements will be needed.18 The recent collapse of
the Terra UST stablecoin has highlighted the urgency of the matter.
Second, policies are needed to support the safety and integrity of the monetary
and financial systems. Cryptocurrency exchanges that hide the identity of transacting
parties and fail to follow basic know-your-customer (KYC) and other Financial Action
Task Force (FATF) requirements should be fined or shut down. Otherwise, they can
be used to launder money, evade taxes or finance terrorism, and to circumvent
economic sanctions. Similarly, banks, credit card companies and other financial
institutions that provide entry and exit points between DeFi and the traditional
system should require identification from users and perform KYC compliance.
Third are policies to protect consumers. While investors should be allowed to
invest in risky assets, including cryptocurrencies, there should be adequate
disclosure. This implies sound regulation of digital asset advertising by crypto
platforms, which can often be misleading and downplay risks. Practices akin to
front-running may require the deployment of new legal approaches.19 In addition,
decentralised platforms cannot, by design, take responsibility in case of fraud or
theft connected to the platform, eg as a result of hacks. This stands in the way of
providing incentives for the basic disclosure of risks and, as such, new approaches
may be needed.20 This logic also extents to the oracle problem. Sound regulatory
rules need to ensure that outside information is not manipulated.
Finally, central banks and regulators need to mitigate risks to financial stability
that arise from the exposure of banks and non-bank financial intermediaries to the
crypto space. Fast-growing investments in cryptocurrencies by traditional financial
institutions mean that shocks to the crypto system could have spillovers. Non-bank
investors, family offices and hedge funds have reportedly been the most active
institutional investors in cryptocurrencies (Graph 6.A). So far, the exposures of large
traditional banks have been limited and direct investments in firms active in crypto
markets are still small relative to bank capital (Graph 6.B).21 That said, bank funding
from stablecoin issuers has increased, as bank liabilities such as certificates of deposit
form a key part of stablecoins’ asset backing.22 Addressing these risks implies a
sound implementation of standards for bank exposures to cryptocurrencies, which
should seek to ensure adequate resilience to large and sudden changes in prices or
large losses through direct and indirect channels.23 This may also require prudential
regulation of crypto exchanges, stablecoin issuers and other key entities in the
crypto system. This does not preclude an innovative approach; for example,
supervision could be embedded in these markets, so that it is conducted “on-chain”.
It is essential to fill data gaps and identify entry points for regulation. The
growth of the crypto market has led to the proliferation of new centralised
intermediaries. Additional entities, such as reserve managers and network
administrators, have developed directly as a response to the growth of stablecoins.
These centralised entities and traditional financial institutions provide a natural
gateway for regulatory responses. These entities could also support the collection
of better and more detailed data on DeFi activities, as well as the investor base.
Across all areas of regulation, the global nature of crypto and DeFi will require
international cooperation. Authorities may need to actively exchange information
and take joint enforcement actions against non-compliant actors and platforms. In
some cases, new bodies such as colleges of supervisors may be necessary to
coordinate policy toward the same regulated entities operating in different
jurisdictions.

The BIS is contributing to this international cooperation through discussions in
BIS committees such as the BIS Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures
A strong canopy supports the global monetary (eco)system
Graph 8
(BIS CPMI) and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). The BIS is
actively engaged in the G20 discussion on the regulation of cryptocurrencies, as
coordinated by the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The BIS is also developing applied
technological capabilities in this area to inform the international policy dialogue. The
Eurosystem Centre of the BIS Innovation Hub is developing a cryptocurrency and
DeFi analysis platform that combines on-chain and off-chain data to produce vetted
information on market capitalisations, economic activity and international flows.

Crypto’s lessons for the monetary system
Overall, the crypto sector provides a glimpse of promising technological
possibilities, but it cannot fulfil all the high-level goals of a digital monetary system.
It suffers from inherent shortcomings in stability, efficiency, accountability and
integrity that can only be partially addressed by regulation. Fundamentally, crypto
and stablecoins lead to a fragmented and fragile monetary system. Importantly,
these flaws derive from the underlying economics of incentives, not from
technological constraints. And, no less significantly, these flaws would persist even
if regulation and oversight were to address the financial instability problems and
risk of loss implicit in crypto.

composability and tokenisation, but to ground them on more secure foundations
so as to harness the virtuous circle of network effects. Central banks can provide
such foundations, and they are working actively to shape the future of the monetary
system. To serve the public interest, central banks are drawing on the best elements
of new technology, together with their efforts to regulate the crypto universe and
address its most immediate drawbacks.

BIS Annual Economic Report 2022

Vision for the future monetary system
The future monetary system should meld new technological capabilities with a
superior representation of central bank money at its core. Rooted in trust in the
currency, the advantages of new digital technologies can thus be reaped through
interoperability and network effects. This allows new payment systems to scale and
serve the real economy. The system can thus adapt to new demands as they arise –
while ensuring the singleness of money across new and innovative activities.
Central banks are uniquely positioned to provide the core of the future
monetary system, as one of their fundamental roles is to issue central bank money
(M0), which serves as the unit of account in the economy. From the basic promise
embodied in the unit of account, all other promises in the economy follow.
The second fundamental role of the central bank, building on the first, is to
provide the means for the ultimate finality of payments by using its balance sheet.
The central bank is the trusted intermediary that debits the account of the ultimate
payer and credits the account of the ultimate payee. Once the accounts are debited
and credited in this way, the payment is final and irrevocable.
The third role of the central bank is to support the smooth functioning of the
payment system by providing sufficient liquidity for settlement. Such liquidity
provision ensures that no logjams will impede the workings of the payment system
when a payment is delayed because the sender is waiting for incoming funds.
The fourth role of the central bank is to safeguard the integrity of the payment
system through regulation, supervision and oversight. Many central banks also
have a role in supervising and regulating commercial banks and other core
participants of the payment system. These intertwined functions of the central bank
leave it well placed to provide the foundation for innovative private sector
services.24
The future monetary system builds on these roles of the central bank to give
full scope for new capabilities of central bank money and innovative services built
on top of them. New private applications will be able to run not on stablecoins, but
on superior technological representations of M0 – such as wholesale and retail
CBDCs, and through retail FPS that settle on the central bank balance sheet. Central
bank innovations can thereby support a wide range of new activities. Because
central banks are mandated to serve the public interest, they can design public
infrastructures to support the monetary system’s high-level policy goals (Table 1,
final column) from the ground up.
This vision entails a number of components that require both formal definitions
and examples. The section first introduces and explains these components. It next
gives a metaphor for what the future system will look like, both domestically and
across borders. Finally, it dives into the specifics of reforms to central bank money
at the wholesale, retail and cross-border level, before reviewing where central banks
stand in achieving this vision.

Components of the future monetary system
The future monetary system builds on the tried and trusted division of roles
between the central bank – which provides the foundations of the system – and
private sector entities that conduct the customer-facing activities. On top of this
traditional division of labour come new standards such as application programming
interfaces (APIs, see glossary) that greatly enhance the interoperability of services
and associated network effects. Not least are new technical capabilities
encompassing programmability, composability and tokenisation, which have so far
been associated with the crypto universe.

90

BIS Annual Economic Report 2022

This vision contains components at both the wholesale and retail level, which
enable a number of new features (in bold).
At the wholesale level, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) can offer new
capabilities and enable transactions between financial intermediaries that go
beyond the traditional medium of central bank reserves. Wholesale CBDCs that are
transacted using permissioned distributed ledger technology (DLT) offer
programmability and atomic settlement, so that transactions are executed
automatically when set conditions are met. They allow a number of different
functions to be combined and executed together, thus facilitating the
composability of transactions. These new capabilities not only permit the
expansion of the types of transactions, but also enable transactions between a
much wider range of financial intermediaries – not just commercial banks.
Wholesale CBDCs also work together across borders, through multi-CBDC
arrangements involving multiple central banks and currencies.
Within the new functions unlocked by wholesale CBDCs, one set of applications
deserves special mention – namely, those stemming from the tokenisation of
deposits (M1), and other forms of money that are represented on permissioned
DLT networks.25 The role of intermediaries in settling transactions was one of the
major advances in the history of money, tracing back to the role of public deposit
banks in Europe in the early history of central banking.26 Bank deposits serve as
the payment medium, as the intermediary debits the account of the payer and
credits the account of the receiver. The tokenisation of deposits takes this principle
and translates the operation to DLT by creating a digital representation of deposits
on the DLT platform, and settling them in a decentralised manner. This could
facilitate new forms of exchange, including fractional ownership of securities and
real assets, allowing for innovative financial services that extend well beyond
payments.
At the customer-facing, or “retail” level, the enhanced capabilities of the financial
intermediaries benefit users in the form of improved interoperability between
customer-facing platforms provided by intermediaries. Core to this interoperability
are APIs, through which users of one platform can easily communicate and send
instructions to other, interlinked platforms. This way, innovations at the retail level
promote greater competition, lower costs and expanded financial inclusion.
Concretely, FPS and retail CBDCs constitute another core feature of the future
monetary system. Retail FPS are systems in which the transmission of a payment
message and the availability of final funds to the payee occur in (near) real time, on
or as near to 24/7 as possible. Many are operated by the central bank. Retail CBDCs
are a type of CBDC that is directly accessible by households and businesses. Both
retail CBDCs and FPS allow for instant payments between end users, through a
range of interfaces and competing private PSPs. They hence build on the two-tiered
system of the central bank and private PSPs. Retail CBDCs and FPS share a number
of further key features and can thus be seen as lying on a continuum. Both are
supported by a data architecture with digital identification and APIs that enable
secure data exchange, thus supporting greater user control over financial data. By
providing an open platform, they promote efficiency and greater competition
between private sector PSPs, thus facilitating lower costs in payment services.
Through inclusive design features, both can support financial inclusion for users
that currently do not have access to digital payments.
Details of the wholesale and retail components are expanded upon below. For
each of these, an advanced representation of central bank money supports private
sector services that serve the real economy. The central bank supports the
singleness of the currency, and interoperability – the ability of participants to
transact in different systems without having to participate in each.27 This allows

more attractive for others.

A metaphor for the future monetary system
The metaphor for the future monetary system is a tree whose solid trunk is the
central bank (Graph 7). As well as exemplifying the solid support provided by
central bank money, the tree metaphor expresses the principle of the monetary
system being rooted (figuratively speaking) in payment finality through ultimate
settlement on the central bank’s balance sheet.
The monetary system based on central bank money supports a diverse and
multi-layered vibrant ecosystem of participants and functions in which competing
private sector PSPs can give full play to their creativity and ingenuity to serve users
better. Underlying these benefits is the virtuous circle set off by network effects
arising from the data architecture, consisting of digital identity and APIs, that
enables interoperability both domestically and across borders.

Zooming out, the global monetary system can then be compared with a forest,
whose canopy facilitates cross-border and cross-currency activity (Graph 8). In the
canopy, infrastructures such as multi-CBDC platforms serve as important new
elements of the system, as discussed in detail below. The functionality of new
platforms in the canopy is ultimately rooted in the domestic settlement layers
underneath.
Innovation is not only about the latest fashion or buzzword. Just as a tree
cannot sustain a vibrant ecosystem without a solid trunk, getting the basics right is
a prerequisite for private innovation that serves the public interest. Ongoing work
at central banks is showcasing how public infrastructures can improve the payment
system, taking advantage of many of the supposed benefits of crypto without the
drawbacks. Wholesale and retail CBDCs, FPS and further reforms in open banking
show how central banks can support interoperability and data governance. In
fulfilling their public interest mandates, central banks are not working alone but
collaborating closely with other public authorities and innovators in the private
sector. The following subsections fill in the details of how the system functions,
together with concrete examples of the functionalities.

Wholesale CBDCs and tokenised money
A CBDC is a digital payment instrument, denominated in the national unit of
account, which is a direct liability of the central bank.28 Much attention has recently
focused on retail CBDCs that are accessible by households and businesses (discussed
below). Yet wholesale CBDCs also offer new functions for payment and settlement,
and to a much wider range of intermediaries than domestic commercial banks. They
could unlock significant private sector innovation across a range of financial services.
Wholesale CBDCs can allow intermediaries to access new capabilities that are
not provided by the reserves held by commercial banks with the central bank.
These are particularly relevant in permissioned DLT networks, where a decentralised

BIS Annual Economic Report 2022

93

network of trusted participants accesses a shared ledger. As discussed below,
decentralised governance is a useful feature of multi-CBDC systems involving
multiple central banks and currencies. Yet the functions could in principle be
offered in more centralised payment systems. Key are self-executing smart contracts
that let participants make their transactions programmable. Transactions thus settle
only when certain pre-specified conditions are met. In security trading, such
automation can allow payment vs payment (PvP) and delivery vs payment (DvP)
mechanisms, meaning that payments and delivery of a security are made only all
together or not at all. Such atomic settlement can significantly speed up settlement
and mitigate counterparty risk.29
One benefit of wholesale CBDCs is that they could be available to a much
wider range of intermediaries than just domestic commercial banks. Allowing nonbank PSPs to transact in CBDC could make for much greater competition and
vibrancy. New protocols built on wholesale CBDCs could be open source, making
the source code freely available for a community of developers to develop and
scrutinise. This feature would allow for libraries of protocols that can be used to
combine functions, thus facilitating the composability of different functions and
enabling new services to be built on top of the programmability function of CBDCs.
By construction, wholesale CBDCs would allow for finality in payments. The
mechanics of how finality is attained in permissioned DLT platforms are described
in more detail in Box C, but their essence can be explained through the simple
analogy with a physical banknote. The recipient of a physical banknote wants to be
assured that the note is genuine, not counterfeit. Ensuring that payment is in
genuine money in a digital system is accomplished by proving the origin or
“provenance” of the money transferred. Crypto proves its provenance by publicly
posting the full history of all transactions by everyone. When real names are used,
such public posting would violate privacy and would be unsuitable as a payment
system. This is where cryptographic techniques such as zero-knowledge proofs
(ZKPs) provide a solution. As the name signifies, “proof” denotes that a statement is
true, and “zero-knowledge” means that no additional information is exposed
beyond the validity of the assertion. Cryptographic techniques allow the payer to
prove that the money was obtained from valid past transactions without having to
post the full history of all transactions. Depending on the detailed implementation,
a “notary” may be needed to prevent the same digital token being spent twice; in
many cases, the central bank can play this role. The common theme is that
decentralisation can be achieved without the structural flaws of crypto.
As issuers of the settlement currency, central banks can support the tokenisation
of regulated financial instruments such as retail deposits.30 Tokenised deposits are a
digital representation of commercial bank deposits on a DLT platform. They would
represent a claim on the depositor’s commercial bank, just as a regular deposit
does, and be convertible into central bank money (either cash or retail CBDC) at
par value. Depositors would be able to convert their deposits into and out of
tokens, and to exchange them for goods, services or other assets. Tokenised
deposits would also be protected by deposit insurance but, unlike traditional
deposits, they would also be programmable and “always on” (24/7), thus lending
themselves to broader uses in retail payments – eg in autonomous ecosystems. This
way, they could facilitate tokenisation of other financial assets, such as stocks or
bonds. This functionality could allow for fractional ownership of assets and for the
ability to exchange these on a 24/7 basis. Crucially, this could be done in a regulated
system, with settlements in wholesale CBDC.
One possible system with tokenised deposits could feature a permissioned DLT
platform. This platform records all transactions in tokens issued by the participating
institutions, eg commercial banks (representing deposits), non-bank PSPs

Making use of DLT with central bank money

Box C

In a permissionless blockchain used for crypto applications, all transactions are public. Privacy is maintained
by hiding the user’s real identity behind a private key. In this sense, there is pseudo-anonymity.1 By contrast, a
monetary system based on users’ real names raises the question of how to safeguard their privacy. Privacy has
the attributes of a fundamental human right. Nobody else needs to know from which supermarket an
individual buys their groceries. Therefore, a basic task of a decentralised monetary system based on real
names is to find a way to ensure both that the ledger is secure without the need for a central authority, while
at the same time preserving the privacy of the individual transactions.
One possible route is through permissioned DLT systems. In these systems, only select users that meet
eligibility requirements can obtain access. Interactions between system participants are thus invisible to people
outside the system. One example is the permissioned DLT system Corda, which is used by private financial
institutions (eg for trade finance platforms) and in a number of central bank wholesale CBDC projects,
including Projects Helvetia, Jura and Dunbar at the BIS Innovation Hub.
In Corda, updates to the ledger are performed through a validation function and a uniqueness function.
Validation, which involves checking that the details of the transaction are correct and that the sender has the
available funds, is done by the system participants. In fact, only the participants that are involved in a transaction
are responsible for validating it. Checking that the sender has a valid claim to funds does not, however, ensure
that they will not attempt to spend those same funds twice. Transaction uniqueness (ie the prevention of
double-spending) is ensured by a centralised authority called a “notary”. Notaries have access to the entire
ledger and hence can ensure that funds being used in a particular transaction are not being used elsewhere. In
the case of wholesale CBDCs, a natural candidate for the notary is the central bank, as this institution already
plays a similar role in maintaining the integrity of the overall transaction record in centralised systems.
In such permissioned systems, a tension can arise between payment integrity and transactional privacy.
Transactional privacy in a peer-to-peer exchange means that only the two participants involved in a transaction
can see that it occurs – very much like when one person hands over a one-dollar bill to a friend. In the case of
a digital banknote, the validation process performed by the participants requires that the recipient can trace
the banknote back to its origin, which in turn entails seeing every one of the banknote’s previous holders. In
the context of Corda, this is called the “backchain problem”. While the system does not allow everyone to see
everything, it does allow participants to have a view beyond their own transactions. Solving the backchain
problem is an important design problem in central bank CBDC projects. The challenge is to arrange matters
so that they can truly emulate paper banknotes and preserve people’s transactional privacy.
Recently, system architects have been exploring the use of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to generate a
cryptographic record that a transaction has occurred, without revealing either the identity of a participant or
the content of the transaction. ZKPs let one party prove to another that a statement is true without revealing
any information beyond that fact. In a payment system, the goal is to prove that the sender of funds obtained
those funds through a legitimate chain of transactions, going all the way back to and including the origination
of the funds, without sharing any details of these transactions. The goal is achieved by replacing each
individual transaction with a ZKP and transferring these proofs, in place of the individual transaction details,
during each successive transaction. This technique allows recipients of a digital banknote to know that it can
be traced back to its origin, without knowing the details of this banknote’s history. Instead of seeing the
history of all previous transactions, the verifier, and, if desired, the notary, can observe only a series of ZKPs
(see Graph C1).
The ZKP technique is generally understood to be an effective means of generating transactional privacy,
but using cryptographic proofs erodes system performance by reducing its speed. Currently, the most popular
ZKP systems are the so-called succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (SNARKs), succinct transparent
arguments of knowledge (STARKs) and Bulletproofs. Each solution has different costs in terms of verification
and overall proof time and overall proof size; these are shown in Table C1. Long verification and proof times
may reduce transaction throughput to levels that are insufficient to settle typical payment system volumes
without adding an unacceptable amount of delay. Researchers are looking for ways to reduce these times.

Retail investors (depositors) would hold tokens in digital wallets and make payments
by transferring tokens across wallets. The settlement of transactions between
financial institutions on the DLT platform would rely on the use of wholesale CBDCs
as settlement currency. To get a sense of how this would work, consider a depositor
who holds a bank’s tokens and wishes to make a payment to the holder of non-bank
PSP tokens, representing e-money, for instance to pay for a house (Graph 9). Both
parties may agree that the payment (green arrow) should occur at the same time
the deed to the house is transferred. In the background, to settle the transaction,
the bank would transfer wholesale CBDC on the DLT platform to the non-bank PSP
(blue arrows). The non-bank PSP would transfer a corresponding amount of new
tokens to its customer’s wallet. All of these steps could occur simultaneously, as part
of a single atomic transaction, executed through smart contracts. In this system,

wholesale CBDCs help to settle transactions and to guarantee the convertibility and
uniformity of the various representations of money. The same system could also
allow for digital representations of stocks and bonds. This would enable end users to
easily access (fractions of) these assets in small denominations, 24/7, from regulated
providers – and to settle the transactions instantaneously.
Programmable CBDCs could also support machine-to-machine payments in
autonomous ecosystems.31 Autonomous machines and devices increasingly
communicate and execute processes without human intervention through the
Internet of Things, a network of connected devices. Looking ahead, machines may
directly purchase goods and services from each other, and manage their own budget.
Their interconnection will increase the need for smart contracts and programmable
money. For example, they may be equipped with wallets, charged with a certain
budget of digital money. Smart contracts may automatically trigger payments as
soon as certain conditions are met, eg the arrival of the goods. This could lead to
significant efficiency gains, for example in the goods logistics sector, where
transactions often take several days and are still predominantly paper-based. The full
potential of these technological developments can be realised only if machine-tomachine transactions are settled instantly, so that any settlement risk is removed.
Existing private sector cryptocurrency projects for the Internet of Things are still
exploratory and suffer from limits to scalability.32 They also raise concerns about the
stability and convertibility of cryptocurrencies used for payments and would require
on- and off-ramp bridges to connect with traditional payment rails. In this respect,

the industry could benefit from CBDCs, which could underpin a decentralised system,
eg by enabling regulated financial institutions to issue programmable money.33
In short, programmability, composability and tokenisation are not the preserve
of crypto. The benefits of atomic settlement and open-source protocols are fully
compatible with central banks being at the core of the validation process. Yet by
relying on central bank money, wholesale CBDCs would benefit from the stability
and singleness of the currency that central banks provide. They would also draw on
the accountability of the central bank and of regulated intermediaries to society. By
supporting innovative private sector services, they would facilitate adaptability so
that the system can meet new needs as they arise.

Retail CBDCs and fast payment systems
Retail CBDCs and retail FPS share many similarities. Retail CBDCs make central bank
money available in digital form to households and businesses. Bank and non-bank
PSPs provide retail-facing payment services. The key difference from retail FPS is
that, for CBDCs, the instrument is a legal claim on the central bank. Retail CBDCs
are thus sometimes seen as “digital cash” – another form of central bank money
available to the public.34 In retail FPS, many of which are operated by the central
bank, the instrument being exchanged is a claim on private intermediaries (eg bank
deposits or e-money). Nonetheless, both retail CBDCs and retail FPS build on public
data architecture with APIs that ensure secure data exchange and interoperability
between different bank and non-bank PSPs. Both feature high speeds and
availability, as transfers occur in real time or near real time on a (near) 24/7 basis.
These retail payment infrastructures have already shown their mettle in
enhancing efficiency and inclusion in the monetary system. Unlike crypto, which
requires high rents and suffers from congestion and limited scalability, CBDCs and
retail FPS allow for network effects to lead to a virtuous circle of greater use, lower
costs and better services. Because of their explicit mandates, central banks can design
systems to meet these goals from the ground up. An open payment system resting
on the interoperability of services offered by competing private PSPs can challenge
rents in concentrated banking sectors and reduce the payments costs for end users.
Retail FPS have already made impressive progress in lowering costs and
supporting financial inclusion for the unbanked. For example, in just over a year
after its launch, the Brazilian retail FPS Pix is used by two thirds of the adult
population – with 50 million users making a digital payment for the first time.
Powered by innovative products and services offered by over 770 private PSPs, Pix
payments have now surpassed credit and debit card transactions (Graph 10.A). The
costs to merchants of accepting person-to-business (P2B) payments average one
tenth of the cost of credit card payments (Graph 10.B). Equally impressive progress
in inclusive, low-cost payments has been made in other economies.35
Retail CBDCs could play a similarly beneficial role as retail FPS, while offering
additional technological capabilities. For example, Project Hamilton – a joint project
by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology Digital Currency Initiative – has shown the technical feasibility of a
CBDC architecture that can process 1.7 million transactions per second – far more
than major card networks or blockchains.36 The project uses functions inspired by
cryptocurrencies, but it does not use DLT. In its next stage, Project Hamilton aims to
create a foundation for more complex functionalities, such as cryptographic designs
for privacy and auditability, programmability and self-custody. The code for the
project is open-source and can be scrutinised by any developer, to maximise
knowledge-sharing and expand the pool of experts contributing to the code base,
including central banks, academia and the private sector.

data privacy laws give consumers the opportunity to grant or deny third parties
consent to use their data. But this option is often difficult to exercise effectively.

Designing retail CBDCs to support financial inclusion

Many central banks around the world see financial inclusion as a key motivation for their work on retail CBDCs.
This is particularly true in emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), where access to digital
payment and other financial services is constrained by several key barriers. These include (i) geographic
factors, eg vast territories or islands; (ii) institutional and regulatory factors, such as a lack of identity credentials
and informality; (iii) economic and market structure issues, including limited competition and high costs in the
financial sector; (iv) characteristics of vulnerability, eg barriers by age, gender, income or disability status; (v) a
lack of educational opportunities and financial literacy; and (vi) distrust of existing financial institutions. In
many EMDEs, a majority of adults lack access to digital payment options.
A new study draws on the experience of nine central banks around the world in tackling financial inclusion
challenges.1 It finds that some central banks consider CBDCs as key to their mandate as a catalyst for
innovation and economic development. Others see CBDCs as a potential complement to existing policies to
support financial inclusion. The study argues that, if CBDCs are to be issued, they could be designed with
several key design features that directly address barriers to financial inclusion. For instance, they might
facilitate low-cost customer enrolment processes, for instance with simplified due diligence, electronic KYC
arrangements and tiered wallets, as demonstrated in several live retail CBDC systems (Graph D1.A). Features
such as the use of third-party agents help to reach isolated communities and to work around a lack of trust in
financial institutions. Central banks can offer a robust, low-cost public infrastructure with a multitude of user
interfaces (Graph D1.B). This includes offline functionality, and interfaces that specifically tailor to underserved
users. And finally, CBDCs foster interoperability both domestically and across borders, thus contributing to
greater competition and lower costs for end users (Graph D1.C).

bring economic benefits to users, for instance when they apply for a loan, want to
use financial planning services or in a range of other contexts. Importantly, such a
system is based on identification – and this identity information may often be held
only by the PSP and not by the central bank. The use of identification also allows
financial intermediaries to screen borrowers to assess their creditworthiness,
thereby ensuring that scarce capital is allocated to its best use.
In the process, central banks can make use of modern cryptography, which offers
solutions to preserve the privacy of users and ensure the security of transactions. This
can be achieved for instance through ZKPs, which verify the authenticity of the
transaction without revealing its content (Box C). Nonetheless, the system would be
based on users’ true, verified identities, ie they would transact under their real names.
Several central banks also see “electronic cash” in the form of retail CBDC as one
potential solution for preserving people’s transactional privacy.41
Identity-based designs are compatible with integrity in the financial system.
With clear mandates and public accountability, systems can be designed to grant
law enforcement authorities access to information with the requisite legal
safeguards. These approaches are already commonplace in the form of bank
secrecy laws and are being considered for retail CBDCs.42 Importantly, transactions
would not be recorded on a public blockchain visible to all. In the corporate space,
new corporate digital identity solutions could improve oversight of beneficial
ownership, thus reducing fraud, tax avoidance and sanctions evasion.43 Together
with new regtech tools and capabilities inspired by blockchain analytics, there is
potential for better tracking illicit activity while making compliance with regulatory
frameworks less resource-intensive.
Finally, retail CBDCs and FPS offer opportunities to improve on accountability
relative to today’s system, and certainly relative to the crypto universe. Indeed, the
design of new public infrastructures is not a task for the central bank alone. New
systems require public dialogue on the role of the central bank in retail payments.
Their operation will require legal mandates to be updated, as well as proper checks
and balances and appropriate forms of central bank accountability to society. It is
for this reason that many central banks have issued consultations on these initiatives
and are promoting dialogue on legal tender and central bank laws.44 A system built
on public infrastructure would also ensure that private service providers are
embedded in a sound regulatory and supervisory framework. Unlike in a parallel
crypto financial system, parties can be held to account for their actions. In this new
ecosystem, there will likely be new private sector business models that do not yet
fit with current regulatory frameworks, but experience to date suggests that
frameworks can adapt to allow for new types of innovative activity.45

Achieving cross-border integration
Integrated global value chains mean that the world is no longer a collection of “island
economies”, but rather a dense network of interconnections that requires a flexible
matrix of money, payments and broader financial services.46 Wholesale and retail
CBDCs as well as retail FPS, can support cross-border integration. The future monetary
system will thus be commensurate with the task of providing robust payment and
settlement rails that can support economic integration and public interest objectives.
The principles behind the construction of multi-CBDC platforms illustrate the
potential for decentralisation to be applied constructively.47 First, when there is
more than one currency involved, more than one central bank needs to take part in
the governance of the payment platform. One way to address the governance
problem among multiple parties is to adopt decentralisation through a DLT
platform. Trusted notaries can manage the shared ledger, and central banks are the

BIS Annual Economic Report 2022

101

natural candidates to take on this task domestically, with shared infrastructure at
the global level. Second, since the decentralisation has to be accomplished using
real names, rather than using private keys as in cryptocurrencies, safeguarding
privacy is an essential design element. Achieving both goals – of respecting privacy
while using real names – can be accomplished by using public key cryptography.
There are different models for multi-CBDC platforms, ranging from simply
coordinating on standards, through interlinking systems, to a fully shared, common
mCBDC platform. On a common mCBDC platform, transfers are recorded on a single
ledger in one step, and participants have full real-time visibility of their balances.
The settlement process is thus simplified, obviating the need for reconciliation of
balances across accounts as in conventional correspondent banking transactions.
A common mCBDC platform creates the opportunity to simplify processes. For
example, business rules or conditions can be automated using the smart contract
features on a DLT platform. Such process automation reaps efficiency gains both in
costs and in transaction time. As mCBDC arrangements involve multiple central
banks, each with their own currency, decentralisation can be a constructive feature,
and permissioned DLT can play an important role. In addition to the currencies of
each central bank in the platform, it could include tokens for other currencies,
including international currencies. These platforms have some family resemblance
with those used in crypto and DeFi, such as smart contracts and programmability
that enable PvP or, in the context of security settlements, DvP across borders.
Linking of public infrastructures across borders is also possible for retail FPS. A
recent project at the BIS Innovation Hub showed the potential for linking FPS in
different jurisdictions so that payments take seconds rather than days, cutting costs
and making fees and exchange rates transparent to senders before they commit to
a payment. Achieving these benefits requires coordination in messaging formats
and in several key policy areas, but it is technically feasible.48

Taking stock of progress toward the vision
Where do central banks stand in achieving this vision of the future monetary
system? Substantial efforts are under way, and central banks are working together
with one another, with other public authorities and with the private sector to
expand the frontier of capabilities in the monetary system.
Globally, a full 90% of central banks recently surveyed are doing some form of
work on wholesale or retail CBDCs.49 A number of wholesale CBDC pilots are under
way, often involving several central banks in different jurisdictions. There are three
live retail CBDCs and a full 28 pilots. This includes the large-scale pilot by the
People’s Bank of China, which now counts 261 million users.50 Meanwhile, over
60 jurisdictions now have retail fast payment systems, with several more planned in
the coming years – such as FedNow in 2023.51 The BIS Innovation Hub is developing
mCBDC platforms in partnerships with member central banks. These are Project
Jura (with the central banks of Switzerland and France), Project Dunbar (with
Singapore, Malaysia, Australia and South Africa), and mBridge (with Hong Kong SAR,
Thailand, China and the United Arab Emirates).
A recent stocktake by the Innovation Hub draws lessons from mCBDC
experiments to date.52 These have demonstrated their feasibility from a technical
perspective using different experimental designs. They have also shown the
potential for much faster, lower-cost and more efficient international settlement,
without the need for intermediaries such as correspondent banks. On the retail
side, the Innovation Hub, through its Hong Kong, London and Nordic centres is
advancing work on cyber-secure architectures, building an open API ecosystem for
retail CBDCs, and exploring resilient and offline CBDC systems.

Achieving frictionless payments in the global monetary system requires strong
cooperation between central banks, combined with innovation in the private sector.
Supporting these efforts is a comparative advantage of the BIS that arises from its
mandate for international settlements. Indeed, the BIS has already developed
proofs-of-concept and prototypes in near real-world settings. These can help to
draw policymakers’ attention to the actual issues they are likely to encounter. They
also show that cooperation is possible even when central banks take different
approaches to some key policy issues.
In sum, central banks are working together to advance domestic policy goals
and to support a seamlessly integrated global monetary system with concrete
benefits for their economies and end users. The solutions they use will draw on a
range of new technologies, some inspired by the crypto monetary system, but
grounded in the solid institutional frameworks that exist today. By adapting the
system now, central banks will help to make money and payments fit for the
decades to come.

Conclusion
The monetary system is a crucial foundation for the economy. Every time
households and businesses make payments across the range of financial
transactions, they place their trust in the safety of money and payment systems as a
public good. Retaining this trust is at the core of central bank mandates.
Rooted in this trust, the monetary system must meet a number of high-level
goals to serve society. It must be safe and stable, and key entities must be held
accountable for their actions. This way, the integrity of the system is ensured. Fast,
reliable and cheap transactions should promote efficiency and financial inclusion,
while users’ rights to privacy and control over data must be upheld. Finally, in an everchanging and globally connected world, the system must be adaptable and open.
Recent events have shown how structural flaws prevent crypto from achieving
the levels of stability, efficiency or integrity required for a monetary system. Instead
of serving society, crypto and DeFi are plagued by congestion, fragmentation and
high rents, in addition to the immediate concerns about the risks of losses and
financial instability.
This chapter has laid out a brighter vision of the future monetary system.
Around the core of the trust provided by central bank money, the private sector
can adopt the best that new technologies have to offer, including programmability,
composability and tokenisation, to foster a vibrant monetary ecosystem. This will
be achieved via advanced payment rails such as CBDCs and retail FPS.
A public-private partnership on these lines could make the monetary system
more adaptable and open across borders. A decade hence, users may take realtime, low-cost payments for granted, and payments across borders may be as
seamless as the cross-border exchange they support. Consumer choice in financial
services should be increased, and innovation will continue to push the frontiers of
what is possible.
In all of this, innovation must start from an understanding of the concrete
needs of households and businesses in the real economy – and of the policy
demands they put on a monetary system. While decentralised technologies such as
DLT offer many possibilities, users’ needs should stay at the forefront of private
innovation, just as the public interest remains the lodestar for central banks.
In both the design of new infrastructures and in regulation, there is an ongoing
need for global cooperation between central banks, and indeed a wide range of
new stakeholders. Supporting this cooperation will remain a key goal of the BIS.

At present, there are no clear and harmonised guidelines as to who can serve
as an oracle, or who is held accountable if a smart contract acts upon incorrect
off-chain information. As it is impossible to write ex ante a smart contract that
covers every possible contingency, some degree of centralisation is needed to
resolve disputes.

Security in DLT refers to the robustness of consensus, ie confidence that the
shared ledger is accurate. Security can be threatened by malicious actors who
compromise the ledger to execute fraudulent transactions, as in a 51% attack
(see glossary).

6

See glossary for a definition, Schär (2021) for an in-depth description, and
Aramonte et al (2021) and Carter and Jeng (2021) for an assessment of risks
and decentralisation. It is noteworthy that, even if DeFi often relies on
anonymous and permissionless DLT to achieve decentralisation, permissioned
DLT also allows for the use of smart contracts and associated composability
(Auer (2022)). In this case, a set of centralised validators are in charge of
validating transactions.

The limit is around four transactions per second for Bitcoin and 30 for
Ethereum. Possible solutions to the problem of high rents stemming from
congestion scalability (eg via “sharding”) usually introduce further technological
complexity and require a higher degree of centralisation in the governance
structure. Further, the sustainability of the incentive structure is not yet fully
understood.

13

Bridges can be divided into two main types: “centralised” and “trustless”. The
differences lie in how bridge transactions are confirmed and how the escrowed
assets are stored. In a centralised system, a network of pre-selected validators
track token deposits on the source chain, lock them up and mint tokens on the
target chain. In a trustless system, anyone can become a validator. For every
bridging transaction, validators are selected randomly from a pool to minimise
the risks of manipulation. In both cases, the consensus and custodial activities
are performed by a limited number of validators.

104

The need for collateral in many transactions is also detrimental to achieving an
inclusive system. Requiring collateral means that it takes money to borrow
money. For example, unless users already have sufficient funds in the form of
cryptocurrency to post as collateral, they cannot borrow another cryptocurrency
on lending platforms. See Aramonte et al (2022).

15

See IOSCO (2022).

16

As discussed above, these “gas fees” are designed to compensate validators.
Although transaction costs are higher in DEXs, some traders prefer these
platforms, in part due to their greater anonymity and interoperability with
other DeFi applications.

In a CBDC, a payment only involves transferring a direct claim on the central
bank from one end user to another. Funds do not pass over the balance sheet
of an intermediary, and transactions are settled directly in central bank money,
on the central bank’s balance sheet and in real time. By contrast, in an FPS the
retail payee receives final funds immediately, but the underlying wholesale
settlement between PSPs may be deferred (see Carstens (2021)).

35

See BIS CPMI (2021). The Unified Payment Interface in India and Bakong in
Cambodia have seen particularly rapid adoption and promotion of financial
inclusion goals.

For instance, some jurisdictions have defined new roles for private intermediaries
in the monetary system, such as payment initiation service providers (EU), thirdparty app providers (India) or virtual banks (China, Hong Kong SAR, Korea).
These often result in new regulatory requirements tailored to newly defined
activities.

Atomic settlement: instant exchange of two assets, such that the transfer of one
occurs only upon transfer of the other one.
Blockchain: a form of permissionless distributed ledger in which details of
transactions are held in the ledger in the form of blocks of information.
Central bank public goods: goods and services provided by the central bank that
serve the public interest, including payment infrastructures and trust in the currency.
Composability: the capacity to combine different components in a system, such as
DeFi protocols.
Consensus: in DLT applications, the process by which validators agree on the state
of a distributed ledger.
Cryptocurrency (also cryptoasset or crypto): a type of private sector digital asset
that depends primarily on cryptography and distributed ledger or similar
technology.
Data architecture: as used here, the combination of identification and application
programming interfaces that allows for the secure use of data.
Decentralised applications (dApps): DeFi applications offering services such as
lending or trading, predominantly between cryptocurrencies and stablecoins.
Decentralised exchanges (DEXs): marketplaces where transactions occur directly
between cryptocurrency or stablecoin traders.
Decentralised finance (DeFi): a set of activities across financial services built on
permissionless DLT such as blockchains.
Digital wallet: an interface that allows users to make transfers or otherwise transact
in digital money and assets.
Distributed ledger technology (DLT): a means of saving information through a
distributed ledger, ie a repeated digital copy of data available at multiple locations.
Gas fees: unit that measures the amount of computational effort required to
execute specific operations on the Ethereum network. Gas refers to the fee required
to conduct a transaction on Ethereum successfully.
Internet of Things: software, sensors and network connectivity embedded in physical
devices, buildings and other items that enable those objects to (i) collect and
exchange data and (ii) send, receive and execute commands, including payments.

Level 1: competing blockchains are sometimes referred to as “level 1” networks, to
distinguish them from separate off-chain (“level 2”) networks that record
transactions outside the distributed ledger.
Market integrity: the prevention of illicit activities in the monetary system, such as
money laundering and terrorism financing, as well as market manipulation.
Monetary system: the set of institutions and arrangements around monetary
exchange. This consists of two components: money and payment systems.
Multi-CBDC arrangements: solutions to make CBDCs compatible, interlink CBDC
systems or create a shared system for cross-border, cross-currency CBDC payments.
Non-fungible tokens (NFTs): unique cryptographic tokens that exist on a blockchain
and cannot be replicated, used to represent ownership of eg artwork, real estate or
other assets.
Open banking: the sharing and leveraging of customer-permissioned data by banks
with third-party developers and firms to build applications and services.
Open source: a feature whereby the original source code is made publicly available.
Oracle: a service that provides outside (“off-chain”) information for use by smart
contracts in a DLT system.
Permissioned DLT: a form of DLT whereby only a pre-defined group of trusted
institutions can act as a validating node.
Permissionless DLT: a form of DLT where any participant can act as a validating
node, for instance with (permissionless) blockchains.
Programmability: a feature of DLT and other technologies whereby actions can be
programmed or automated.
Proof-of-stake: a method by which validators pledge or “stake” coins that are used
as an incentive that transactions added to the distributed ledger are valid.
Proof-of-work: a method by which validators compete to perform mathematical
computations to verify and add transactions to the distributed ledger.
Pseudo-anonymity: a practice by which users are identified by an address or
pseudonym, for instance in a publicly viewable ledger.
Security: in DLT applications, security often refers to the robustness of consensus,
ie confidence that the shared ledger is accurate.
Smart contract: self-executing applications that can trigger an action if some prespecified conditions are met.
Stablecoin: a cryptocurrency that aims to maintain a stable value relative to a
specified asset, or a pool or basket of assets.

Token: a digital representation of value in a DLT system. Assets that are represented
with a token can be said to be “tokenised”. (This is unrelated to the distinction
between account-based vs token-based payment instruments.)
Tokenised deposit: a digital representation of a bank deposit in a DLT system. A
tokenised deposit represents a claim on a commercial bank, just like a regular
deposit.
Total value locked: total value of assets deposited in a DeFi protocol.
Throughput: a measure of the number of transactions that can be processed in a
payment system in a given period of time, eg per second.
Validator or validating node: an entity that verifies transactions in a blockchain. In
some networks, this role is played by “miners”.
Zero-knowledge proof: a cryptographic technique that allows one party to prove
to another party that a statement is true without revealing information beyond that
fact.
