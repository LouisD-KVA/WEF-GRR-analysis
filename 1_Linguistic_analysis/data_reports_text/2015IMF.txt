Editor’s notes:
(October 1, 2015)
Note 44 on page 122 has been amended to correct the start date of the period covered from January 2012 to
January 2013.
(October 7, 2015)
The final sentence of the second full bullet on page 4 has been amended. The final clause has been changed
from “reflecting slower U.S. growth but also lackluster domestic demand” to read “reflecting slower U.S. growth
and a drop in oil production.”
The fifth sentence of the final bullet in the first column of page 15 has been amended. The final clause has
been changed from “with significant negative spillovers onto growth in large parts of the region given the size
and interconnectedness of the Brazilian economy” to read instead “with negative spillovers on other parts of
the region, especially Brazil’s trading partners in Mercosur.”
(October 13, 2015)
The last three sentences of the first full paragraph on page 21 have been replaced. The original text of these
sentences read as follows:
Simulations using the IMF’s Global Projection Model, which draw on past shocks over a longer horizon, suggest a small decrease in the probability of a recession in the major advanced economies over a four-quarter
horizon relative to April 2015 (Figure 1.15, panel 1). However, the risk of a recession is now higher in the
Latin America 5 and the “rest of the world” group. This increase, which highlights the higher emerging market
economy risks noted earlier in the chapter, reflects lower starting values for growth, given weaker growth in the
second quarter of 2015 for these economies as a group and weaker near-term forecasts.
The amended text reads as follows:
Simulations using the IMF’s Global Projection Model, which draw on past shocks over a longer horizon, suggest a small increase in the probability of a recession in the major advanced economies and in the Latin America
5 economies over a four-quarter horizon relative to April 2015 (Figure 1.15, panel 1). This increase primarily
reflects the lower starting values for growth for some of the economies and the somewhat lower growth forecast
under the baseline. With the latter, the probability of negative shocks leading to a technical recession is higher
compared to a situation in which the baseline forecast is stronger.

ASSUMPTIONS AND CONVENTIONS

A number of assumptions have been adopted for the projections presented in the World Economic Outlook
(WEO). It has been assumed that real effective exchange rates remained constant at their average levels during July
27–August 24, 2015, except for those for the currencies participating in the European exchange rate mechanism
II (ERM II), which are assumed to have remained constant in nominal terms relative to the euro; that established
policies of national authorities will be maintained (for specific assumptions about fiscal and monetary policies for
selected economies, see Box A1 in the Statistical Appendix); that the average price of oil will be $51.62 a barrel
in 2015 and $50.36 a barrel in 2016 and will remain unchanged in real terms over the medium term; that the
six-month London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) on U.S. dollar deposits will average 0.4 percent in 2015 and
1.2 percent in 2016; that the three-month euro deposit rate will average 0.0 percent in 2015 and 2016; and that
the six-month Japanese yen deposit rate will yield on average 0.1 percent in 2015 and 2016. These are, of course,
working hypotheses rather than forecasts, and the uncertainties surrounding them add to the margin of error that
would in any event be involved in the projections. The estimates and projections are based on statistical information available through September 16, 2015.
The following conventions are used throughout the WEO:
. . . to indicate that data are not available or not applicable;
– 	between years or months (for example, 2014–15 or January–June) to indicate the years or months covered, including the beginning and ending years or months;
/
between years or months (for example, 2014/15) to indicate a fiscal or financial year.
“Billion” means a thousand million; “trillion” means a thousand billion.
“Basis points” refers to hundredths of 1 percentage point (for example, 25 basis points are equivalent to ¼ of 1
percentage point).
Data refer to calendar years, except in the case of a few countries that use fiscal years. Please refer to Table F in
the Statistical Appendix, which lists the economies with exceptional reporting periods for national accounts and
government finance data for each country.
For some countries, the figures for 2014 and earlier are based on estimates rather than actual outturns. Please
refer to Table G in the Statistical Appendix, which lists the latest actual outturns for the indicators in the national
accounts, prices, government finance, and balance of payments indicators for each country.
• Data for Lithuania are now included in the euro area aggregates, but they were excluded in the April 2015
WEO.
• Projections for Greece are based on data available as of August 12, 2015.
• As in the April 2015 WEO, data for Syria are excluded from 2011 onward because of the ongoing conflict and
the related lack of data.
In the tables and figures, the following conventions apply:
• If no source is listed on tables and figures, data are drawn from the WEO database.
• When countries are not listed alphabetically, they are ordered on the basis of economic size.
• Minor discrepancies between sums of constituent figures and totals shown reflect rounding.
As used in this report, the terms “country” and “economy” do not in all cases refer to a territorial entity that is
a state as understood by international law and practice. As used here, the term also covers some territorial entities
that are not states but for which statistical data are maintained on a separate and independent basis.

FURTHER INFORMATION AND DATA

This version of the World Economic Outlook (WEO) is available in full through the IMF eLibrary (www.elibrary.
imf.org) and the IMF website (www.imf.org). Accompanying the publication on the IMF website is a larger compilation of data from the WEO database than is included in the report itself, including files containing the series
most frequently requested by readers. These files may be downloaded for use in a variety of software packages.
The data appearing in the World Economic Outlook are compiled by the IMF staff at the time of the WEO exercises. The historical data and projections are based on the information gathered by the IMF country desk officers
in the context of their missions to IMF member countries and through their ongoing analysis of the evolving situation in each country. Historical data are updated on a continual basis as more information becomes available, and
structural breaks in data are often adjusted to produce smooth series with the use of splicing and other techniques.
IMF staff estimates continue to serve as proxies for historical series when complete information is unavailable.
As a result, WEO data can differ from those in other sources with official data, including the IMF’s International
Financial Statistics.
The WEO data and metadata provided are “as is” and “as available,” and every effort is made to ensure their
timeliness, accuracy, and completeness, but it cannot be guaranteed. When errors are discovered, there is a concerted effort to correct them as appropriate and feasible. Corrections and revisions made after publication are
incorporated into the electronic editions available from the IMF eLibrary (www.elibrary.imf.org) and on the IMF
website (www.imf.org). All substantive changes are listed in detail in the online tables of contents.
For details on the terms and conditions for usage of the WEO database, please refer to the IMF Copyright and
Usage website (www.imf.org/external/terms.htm).

PREFACE

The analysis and projections contained in the World Economic Outlook are integral elements of the IMF’s
surveillance of economic developments and policies in its member countries, of developments in international
financial markets, and of the global economic system. The survey of prospects and policies is the product of a

FOREWORD

S

ix years after the world economy emerged
from its broadest and deepest postwar recession, a return to robust and synchronized
global expansion remains elusive. The revised
forecasts in this latest World Economic Outlook report
underscore the challenges all countries face. Despite
considerable differences in country-specific outlooks,
the new forecasts mark down expected near-term
growth rates marginally, but nearly across the board.
Moreover, downside risks to the world economy
appear more pronounced than they did just a few
months ago.
Near-term economic growth still looks stronger in
advanced economies, compared with the recent past,
but weaker in the emerging market and developing
economies that account for a growing share of world
output and will still account for the lion’s share of
world growth. Within advanced economies, receding legacies of recent crises, coupled with protracted
monetary policy support and a return to fiscal neutrality, have underpinned generally accelerating output
and falling unemployment, although deflationary
pressures remain. Recovery is most advanced in the
United States and the United Kingdom, where monetary policy looks likely to tighten soon, but is more
tentative in the euro area and Japan. In countries
outside of the advanced economies, the sources of
slower growth are diverse, ranging from commodity
price declines (which are also affecting a few advanced
economies adversely), to overhangs from past rapid
credit growth, to political turmoil. Of course, countries with multiple diagnoses are faring worst, in some
cases also facing higher inflation. For emerging market
and developing economies as a whole, our forecast
is that 2015 will mark the fifth consecutive year of
declining growth.
What underpins forecasts of moderating growth?
First, the ongoing experience of slow productivity
growth suggests that long-run potential output growth
may have fallen broadly across economies. Persistently
low investment helps explain limited labor productivity and wage gains, although the joint productivity
of all factors of production, not just labor, has also

been slow. Low aggregate demand is one factor that
discourages investment, as the last World Economic
Outlook report showed. Slow expected potential
growth itself dampens aggregate demand, further limiting investment, in a vicious circle. Aging populations
further restrain investment in a number of countries;
in some others, institutional shortcomings or political
instability are deterrents. In its more extreme forms,
political conflict has created a large global stock of
displaced persons, both within and across borders. The
economic and social costs are immense.
Chapter 1 suggests that recessions may have a
permanent negative effect not only on trend productivity levels, but on trend productivity growth. This
mechanism would make current low productivity
forecasts look in part like products of the post-2007
turbulence. Some economic historians advance the
idea that the postwar global growth experience largely
reflects diminishing returns along the extensive margin
of technological innovation, punctuated temporarily
by the entry of China and the former nations of the
Soviet Union into the global market economy and
by the information and communications technology revolution. Others counter that transformative
innovation continues in many areas, from robotics to
bioengineering. But like electrification over a century
ago, these advances may take decades to embody in
commercial production processes whose outputs are
measured in national income. Only time can resolve
these debates.
For countries that export oil and other commodities, changes in prices affect both the output gap
and potential output itself, so recent movements in
commodity prices also inform the near-term and
longer-term output forecasts. Those movements have
been dramatic, in part because of changes in China’s
economy, and affect low-income commodity exporters with particular force. Now the world’s most
important importer of metals, China maintained very
rapid growth rates during the 2000s through 2011; as
commodity prices rose, exporters invested heavily in
capacity, fueling domestic growth. China’s leadership
has recently targeted lower growth rates, however, as it

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: ADJUSTING TO LOWER COMMODITY PRICES

seeks to rebalance its formerly export- and investmentdriven economy in favor of consumption, including
of services. As Chapters 1 and 2 document, many real
commodity prices, notably those of metals, have fallen
from peaks reached in 2011, and fell particularly
sharply in the recent weeks of financial volatility starting in mid-August. It remains unclear, at the time of
publication, if the recent declines represent a downward overshooting, but the effects of earlier reductions
are already reflected in commodity exporter growth.
Chapter 2 estimates that on average about a third of
the resulting growth reductions are attributable to the
structural component of growth, mostly via reduced
investment.
Commodity exporters in particular have seen sharp
depreciations of their currencies, but a general trend
of reduced financial inflows to emerging markets
has resulted in more generalized depreciation against
the U.S. dollar, euro, and yen. Chapter 3 suggests
that these exchange rate changes should be associated with growing net exports for the depreciating
countries, a development that is part of the natural
adjustment process to differential growth rates that
flexible exchange rates promote. Although one result
may be an increase in the current account deficits of
some advanced economies with relatively good growth
performance, it is important that these exchange rate
adjustments be seen as the natural shock absorbers
they typically are rather than as intentional acts of
“currency war.” Indeed, past attempts by emerging
markets to fix their exchange rates in the face of large
financial outflows had quite negative consequences for
global financial stability.
Large exchange rate depreciations carry the risk
of negative balance sheet effects. A notable potential
pressure point is offshore foreign-currency borrowing
by emerging market corporations. Counteracting such

xiv

risks are substantial reserve buffers, greater external
equity finance, and a growing trend of domesticcurrency denomination of onshore loans. Of course,
other risks abide—renewed concerns about China’s
growth potential, Greece’s future in the euro area,
the impact of sharply lower oil prices, and contagion
effects could be sparks for market volatility. In the
advanced economies and in China, deflationary pressures, which continue to slow balance sheet adjustment, have not been entirely banished.
No single set of policy prescriptions is suitable for every country seeking to improve growth
performance or build resilience. But some familiar
general principles still apply in light of the shared
challenges that countries face. Emerging market and
developing economies need to be ready for monetary
policy normalization by the United States. Advanced
economies must continue to deal with crisis legacies where they persist. At the same time, monetary
accommodation should continue where output
gaps are negative, supplemented by fiscal measures
where fiscal space permits. In particular, the case for
infrastructure investment seems compelling at a time
of very low long-term real interest rates. Investment
is one way to enhance potential output growth, but
targeted structural reforms can also play an important positive role. Such reforms help not only to
enhance future growth, but to increase the resilience
of growth. They can help low-income countries to
diversify their export bases. In all countries, continued strengthening of micro- and macro-prudential
policy frameworks will also support resilience to
economic shocks, whether originating domestically
or from abroad.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Global growth for 2015 is projected at 3.1 percent, 0.3
percentage point lower than in 2014, and 0.2 percentage
point below the forecasts in the July 2015 World Economic Outlook (WEO) Update. Prospects across the
main countries and regions remain uneven. Relative to
last year, the recovery in advanced economies is expected
to pick up slightly, while activity in emerging market and
developing economies is projected to slow for the fifth year
in a row, primarily reflecting weaker prospects for some
large emerging market economies and oil-exporting countries. In an environment of declining commodity prices,
reduced capital flows to emerging markets and pressure
on their currencies, and increasing financial market
volatility, downside risks to the outlook have risen, particularly for emerging market and developing economies.
Global growth remains moderate—and once again
more so than predicted a few months earlier. Although
country-specific shocks and developments play a role,
the persistently modest pace of recovery in advanced
economies and the fifth consecutive year of growth
declines in emerging markets suggest that medium-term
and long-term common forces are also importantly at
play. These include low productivity growth since the
crisis, crisis legacies in some advanced economies (high
public and private debt, financial sector weakness, low
investment), demographic transitions, ongoing adjustment in many emerging markets following the postcrisis credit and investment boom, a growth realignment in China—with important cross-border repercussions—and a downturn in commodity prices triggered
by weaker demand as well as higher production
capacity. Chapter 2 of this WEO report and the Commodities Special Feature in Chapter 1 examine in detail
causes and implications of the commodity price downturn, while the October 2015 Fiscal Monitor examines
the role of fiscal policy and fiscal policy frameworks in
managing commodity price volatility.
Financial market volatility spiked in August, following the depreciation of the renminbi, with an increase
in global risk aversion, weakening currencies for many
emerging markets, and a sharp correction in equity
prices worldwide. Temporary surges in volatility had

earlier been associated with events surrounding Greek
debt negotiations and the sharp stock market decline
in China and subsequent policy measures by the Chinese authorities in June–July. With the first increase
in U.S. policy rates approaching and a worsening of
the global outlook, financial conditions for emerging
markets have tightened since the spring, especially
in recent weeks: dollar bond spreads and long-term
local-currency bond yields have increased by 50 to 60
basis points on average, and stock prices are weaker,
while exchange rates have depreciated or come under
pressure. Financial conditions in advanced economies
continue in contrast to be easy, and real interest rates
remain low even as the policy rate liftoff approaches
in the United States and the United Kingdom.
Commodity prices have weakened, particularly
in recent weeks. After increasing in the spring from
their January trough, oil prices have declined sharply,
reflecting resilient supply, the prospects of higher
future output following the nuclear deal with the
Islamic Republic of Iran, and weaker global demand.
Metal prices have also fallen on concerns about global
demand, especially the slowdown in commodityintensive investment and manufacturing activity in
China, but also owing to increases in supply following
the past mining investment boom.
For many commodity exporters with flexible
exchange rate regimes, weakening commodity prices
have triggered sizable currency depreciation. But
emerging market currencies more generally have seen
sharp depreciations since the spring, particularly in
August, while exchange rate movements across major
advanced economy currencies have been relatively
modest in recent months compared to the August
2014–March 2015 period. These realignments across
floating-rate currencies have reflected to an important
extent the evolution of underlying fundamentals—
countries with weakening growth prospects and worsening terms of trade are facing currency depreciation
pressures as part of global adjustment. As discussed in
Chapter 3, countries experiencing sharp and persistent exchange rate movements will likely see notable
changes in their net external demand.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: ADJUSTING TO LOWER COMMODITY PRICES

These global factors—and country-specific developments—point to a somewhat weaker recovery in 2015
and 2016 than previously envisaged, and to higher
downside risks.
Growth in advanced economies is projected to
increase modestly this year and next year. This year’s
developments reflect primarily a strengthening of
the modest recovery in the euro area and a return to
positive growth in Japan, supported by declining oil
prices, accommodative monetary policy, and in some
cases, currency depreciation. The pickup in advanced
economies is tempered by lower growth in commodity exporters—particularly Canada and Norway—and
in Asia outside of Japan (in particular, Korea and
Taiwan Province of China). Unemployment is declining, but underlying productivity growth remains weak,
including in the United States, where the recovery
is more entrenched. This heightens concern about
the medium-term outlook. Some pickup in growth
is expected in 2016 (especially in North America),
but medium-term prospects remain subdued, reflecting a combination of lower investment, unfavorable
demographics, and weak productivity growth. The
recent further decline in oil prices, as well as in prices
of other commodities, should support demand in the
majority of advanced economies that are net commodity importers, but the slowdown in emerging markets
will imply weaker exports.
The renewed declines in commodity prices will
again put downward pressure on headline inflation
in advanced economies in the coming months and
could delay the expected pickup in core inflation as the
recovery progresses. While core inflation has remained
more stable, it generally is still much below central
bank objectives. The outlook is for inflation to remain
subdued, notwithstanding declining unemployment
and weaker medium-term growth potential.
Growth prospects in emerging markets are very different across countries and regions, but the outlook is
generally weakening, with growth projected to decline
for the fifth year in a row. This reflects a combination
of factors: weaker growth in oil exporters; a slowdown in China with less reliance on import-intensive
investment; adjustment in the aftermath of credit and
investment booms; and a weaker outlook for exporters
of other commodities, including in Latin America, following declines in other commodity prices, as well as
geopolitical tensions and domestic strife in a number
of countries.

International Monetary Fund | October 2015

For most emerging market economies, external conditions are becoming more difficult. While currency
depreciation will help net exports, the “pull” from
advanced economies will be somewhat more modest
than previously forecast, given their weak recovery and
moderate prospects for medium-term growth. Capital flows to emerging markets have slowed in recent
quarters, and the liftoff of U.S. policy rates from the
zero lower bound is likely to be associated with some
tightening of external financial conditions. And while
the growth slowdown in China is so far in line with
forecasts, its cross-border repercussions appear greater
than previously envisaged. This is reflected in weakening commodity prices (especially those for metals) and
reduced exports to China (particularly in some east
Asian economies).
Growth in emerging market and developing economies is projected to rebound in 2016. This reflects
mostly a less deep recession or a partial normalization
of conditions in countries in economic distress in 2015
(including Brazil, Russia, and some countries in Latin
America and in the Middle East), spillovers from the
stronger pickup in activity in advanced economies,
and the easing of sanctions on the Islamic Republic of
Iran. China’s growth is projected to slow further, albeit
gradually.
The weakness in commodity prices, slower-thanexpected global growth, and the prospect of tighter
global financial conditions weigh on the outlook for
low-income countries. Some have been running large
current account deficits, benefiting from easy access
to foreign savings and abundant foreign direct investment, especially in resource-rich countries, and they
are hence particularly vulnerable to external financial
shocks.
The balance of risks is still tilted to the downside.
Lower oil and other commodity prices could provide
some upside to demand in commodity importers,
but complicate the outlook for commodity exporters, some of which already face strained initial conditions. The Chinese authorities face difficult trade-offs
in their objectives of achieving a transition to more
consumption-driven growth without activity slowing
too much, while also reducing financial vulnerabilities and implementing reforms to strengthen the role
of market forces in the economy. Emerging markets
remain vulnerable in the short term to further declines
in commodity prices and sharp appreciation of the
U.S. dollar, which could further strain corporate

Executive Summary

balance sheets in some countries. Increased financial
market volatility can pose financial stability challenges
in advanced economies (for instance, if accompanied
by a sudden decompression of risk premiums), with
substantial spillovers onto emerging markets, including
through tighter financial conditions and a reversal of
capital flows.
The main medium-term risk for advanced economies is a further decline of already-low growth into
near stagnation, particularly if global demand falters
further as prospects weaken for emerging market and
developing economies. In this context, persistently
below-target inflation could become more entrenched.
In emerging markets, medium-term risks come from
spillovers from a “hard landing” or much slower potential growth in China, or lower potential growth more
generally.
Raising both actual and potential output through
a combination of demand support and structural
reforms continues to be the economic policy priority.
In advanced economies, accommodative monetary
policy remains essential, alongside macroprudential
policies to contain financial sector risks as needed.
Countries with fiscal space and sizable output gaps or
significant reliance on net external demand should ease
their fiscal stance in the near term, especially through
increased infrastructure investment. Indeed, to the
extent that demand support is able to boost confidence
and investment, which has been lagging in many
advanced economies, this would also contribute to
higher potential output. The structural reform agenda
is country specific, but its main planks are measures to
strengthen labor force participation and trend employment, facilitate labor market adjustment, tackle legacy

debt overhang, and lower barriers to entry in product
markets, especially in services.
Emerging market and developing economies face a
difficult trade-off between supporting demand amid
slowing growth—actual and potential—and reducing
vulnerabilities in a more difficult external environment.
Many economies have eased macroeconomic policies in
response. The scope for further easing varies considerably across countries, however, given differences in
growth performance, macroeconomic conditions, and
sensitivity to commodity price shocks, as well as external, financial, and fiscal vulnerabilities.
• In oil importers, lower oil prices have reduced price
pressures and external vulnerabilities, which will
ease the burden on monetary policy. These positive effects are, however, offset in oil importers that
export other commodities by weaker export prices
and the ensuing exchange rate depreciation.
• In oil exporters without fiscal space, lower oil
revenues require a reduction in public spending. For
those with space, it is appropriate to adjust the fiscal
position gradually, but medium-term adjustment
plans should be formulated and initiated to maintain policy credibility.
• In commodity-exporting countries with flexible
exchange rate regimes, currency depreciation can
help offset the demand impact of terms-of-trade
losses, but sharp exchange rate changes can in
some countries exacerbate vulnerabilities associated
with high corporate leverage and foreign-currency
exposure.
• Structural reforms to raise productivity and remove
bottlenecks to production are urgently needed in
many economies.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND PROSPECTS

Global growth declined in the first half of 2015, reflecting a further slowdown in emerging markets and a weaker
recovery in advanced economies. It is now projected at
3.1 percent for 2015 as a whole, slightly lower than
in 2014, and 0.2 percentage point below the forecasts
in the July 2015 World Economic Outlook (WEO)
Update. Prospects across the main countries and regions
remain uneven. Relative to last year, growth in advanced
economies is expected to pick up slightly, while it is
projected to decline in emerging market and developing
economies. With declining commodity prices, depreciating emerging market currencies, and increasing financial
market volatility, downside risks to the outlook have risen,
particularly for emerging market and developing economies.
Global activity is projected to gather some pace
in 2016. In advanced economies, the modest recovery
that started in 2014 is projected to strengthen further.
In emerging market and developing economies, the
outlook is projected to improve: in particular, growth
in countries in economic distress in 2015 (including
Brazil, Russia, and some countries in Latin America
and in the Middle East), while remaining weak or
negative, is projected to be higher next year, more than
offsetting the expected gradual slowdown in China.

Recent Developments and Prospects
The evolution of the global outlook in recent
months reflects a combination of short-term factors
and longer-term forces.

The World Economy in Recent Months
Growth in advanced economies in the first half
of 2015 remained modest. For most emerging market
economies, external conditions are becoming more
difficult. Financial market volatility rose sharply during
the summer, with declining commodity prices and
downward pressure on many emerging market currencies. Capital inflows have slowed, and the liftoff of
U.S. policy rates from the zero lower bound is likely
to herald some further tightening of external financial

conditions. And while the growth slowdown in China
is so far broadly in line with forecasts, its cross-border
repercussions appear larger than previously envisaged.
This is reflected in weakening commodity prices (especially those for metals) and weak exports to China.
Slowing Global Activity, Tame Inflation
Preliminary data suggest that global growth in the
first half of 2015 was 2.9 percent, about 0.3 percentage
point weaker than predicted in April of this year (Figure 1.1). Growth was below forecast for both advanced
economies and emerging markets. Specifically:
• Growth in the United States was weaker than
expected, despite a strong second quarter. This
reflected setbacks to activity in the first quarter,
caused by one-off factors, notably harsh winter
weather and port closures, as well as much lower
capital spending in the oil sector. Despite weaker
growth, the unemployment rate declined to 5.1 percent at the end of August, 0.4 percentage point
below its February level (and 1 percentage point
below the level a year ago). Lower capital expenditures in the oil sector were also a major contributor
to the slowdown in Canada, where economic activity contracted modestly during the first two quarters
of 2015.
• The recovery was broadly in line with the April forecast in the euro area, with stronger-than-expected
growth in Italy and especially in Ireland and Spain
(sustained by recovering domestic demand) offsetting weaker-than-expected growth in Germany.
• In the United Kingdom, GDP expanded at an
annualized rate of 2¼ percent in the first half of
2015, with the unemployment rate now back near
its precrisis average of about 5½ percent.
• In Japan, a strong rebound in the first quarter was
followed by a drop in activity in the second quarter. Over the first half of the year, consumption fell
short of expectations and so did net exports. Exports
declined substantially in the second quarter.
• Growth in China was broadly in line with previous
forecasts. Investment growth slowed compared with

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: ADJUSTING TO LOWER COMMODITY PRICES

Figure 1.1. Global Activity Indicators
Global growth moderated in the ﬁrst half of 2015, and global industrial production
and world trade volumes slowed markedly. Global activity is projected to gather
pace in 2016. In advanced economies, the projections suggest a broad-based
further strengthening of growth in the second half of 2015 and in early 2016. In
emerging market and developing economies, the pickup in 2016 mainly reﬂects a
gradual improvement in countries in economic distress in 2015.

last year and imports contracted, but consumption growth remained steady. While exports were
also weaker than expected, they declined less than
imports, and net exports contributed positively to
growth. Equity prices have dropped sharply since
July after a one-year bull run. While the authorities intervened to restore orderly market conditions,
market volatility remained elevated through August.
•• Economic activity in some advanced and emerging market economies in east Asia—such as Korea,
Taiwan Province of China, and economies of
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
members—was also a bit weaker than expected,
reflecting lower exports but also a slowdown in
domestic demand.
•• In Latin America, the downturn in Brazil was
deeper than expected, and with declining commodity prices, momentum continues to weaken in other
countries in the region. Growth was also lower than
expected in Mexico, reflecting slower U.S. growth
and a drop in oil production.
•• The decline in GDP in Russia over the first half
of 2015 was somewhat larger than forecast, and the
recession in Ukraine was deeper than previously forecast, reflecting the ongoing conflict in the region.
•• Macroeconomic indicators suggest that economic
activity in sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle
East—for which quarterly GDP series are not
broadly available—also fell short of expectations,
affected by the drop in oil prices, declines in other
commodity prices, and geopolitical and domestic
strife in a few countries.
Global industrial production remained weak
through 2014, consistent with the uneven strength in
demand across major economies and groups of countries, and slowed markedly over the course of the first
half of 2015, reflecting some building of inventories
in late 2014 and early 2015 but also lower investment
growth. World trade volumes also slowed in the first
half of 2015. Weak investment worldwide, particularly
in mining, as well as the trade spillovers of China’s
growth transition, has likely contributed to this slowing. Measuring the extent of the trade slowdown in the
current context of large commodity price and exchange
rate changes is challenging, however, and depends
on the underlying measure. National-accounts-based
estimates suggest a moderation in the growth of world
trade volumes, while measures based on international
merchandise trade statistics, depicted in the first panel
of Figure 1.1, imply an outright contraction.

CHAPTER 1

Headline inflation declined in advanced economies
(Figure 1.2), mostly reflecting the decline in oil prices
and softer prices for other commodities, while core
inflation remained stable. With regard to emerging
markets, lower prices for oil and other commodities
(including food, which has a larger weight in the consumer price index of emerging market and developing
economies) have generally contributed to reductions in
inflation, except in countries suffering sizable currency
depreciations, such as Russia.
Declining Commodity Prices
After remaining broadly stable during the second
quarter of 2015, oil prices declined through much of
the third quarter (Figure 1.3). Weaker-than-expected
global activity played a role, but supply was also higher
than expected, reflecting strong production in members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries as well as in the United States and Russia.
Furthermore, a future boost to supply is expected,
coming from the Islamic Republic of Iran after the
recent nuclear agreement with the P5+1 nations.1
Recent developments suggest that oil markets will
take longer to adjust to current conditions of excess
flow supply, and oil prices through 2020 are now forecast to remain below the levels projected a few months
ago. Supply has remained more resilient than expected,
and global activity has been weaker. While lower oil
prices have supported demand in importers, other
shocks have partly offset the effects and so far prevented
a broad-based pickup in activity, which in turn would
have supported oil market rebalancing. The income
windfall gains from lower oil prices have supported a
pickup in private consumption in advanced economies,
broadly as expected, except in the United States, where
harsh winter weather and other temporary factors weakened the consumption response somewhat, and Japan,
where the consumption response has been dampened
by delayed pass-through and wage moderation. But
investment has not responded, partly reflecting a greater
contraction in oil sector investment, but also lackluster
investment more broadly. And in emerging markets,
economic activity has been weaker than expected, particularly in oil exporters, as discussed earlier.
As examined in more detail in the Special Feature,
the prices of nonfuel commodities—especially base
metals—have fallen sharply in recent weeks. The

(Year-over-year percent change, unless noted otherwise)
Headline inﬂation has declined in advanced economies, mostly reﬂecting the decline
in the prices of oil and other commodities. Core inﬂation has remained more stable,
but generally is below central banks’ inﬂation objectives, as are nominal unit labor
costs. In emerging market economies, lower commodity prices have also
contributed to lowering headline inﬂation, but sizable currency depreciation has led
to offsets on the upside in some economies.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: ADJUSTING TO LOWER COMMODITY PRICES

Figure 1.3. Commodity and Oil Markets
In global oil markets, spot prices have declined again after rising from the lows
reached in January 2015. More resilient supply, including in North America, and
weaker global activity likely have been the main factors behind the renewed
downward pressure on prices. The adjustment to excess ﬂow supply conditions is
now expected to take longer, and prices are projected to remain below the levels
assumed a few months ago.

dynamics are similar to those of the recent adjustment in the oil market. High prices have generally led
to a buildup in supply capacity that came onstream
as demand began to slow. However, developments
in China play a much more important role in base
metal markets than they do in the oil market. China’s
share in the global consumption of these metals
has increased from some 10 to 20 percent in the
early 2000s to more than 50 percent currently. Some
of this increase relates to the country’s role as a manufacturing hub, but it also reflects the infrastructure
investment and construction boom in 2009–13 after
the global financial crisis. China’s growth transition
and slower metal-intensive investment growth have
been instrumental in weakening base metal prices, and
the trend is expected to continue during the transition.
With demand growth expected to stay relatively weak
under the baseline projections, prices are assumed to
move broadly sideways in the near term.
The global macroeconomic implications of lower
oil prices were discussed in detail in the April 2015
WEO. In commodity exporters, the near-term outlook
has deteriorated with lower oil prices and commodity prices more broadly. Chapter 2 analyzes in more
detail the implications of commodity terms-of-trade
fluctuations for real GDP in commodity exporters. All
else equal, current WEO assumptions for commodity
prices imply average commodity exporter growth rates
almost 1 percentage point lower in 2015–17 than in
2012–14—with a stronger drag for exporters of fuel
and metals (about 2¼ percentage points). The impact
will, of course, also depend on other factors, including
macroeconomic policy responses—as discussed in the
October 2015 Fiscal Monitor.
Exchange Rate Movements
Weakening commodity prices have been reflected in
sizable exchange rate depreciation for many commodity exporters with flexible exchange rate regimes. But
emerging market currencies more generally have seen
sharp depreciations since the spring, and particularly
since July. Exchange rate movements across major
advanced economy currencies have instead been relatively modest in recent months, after the large changes
during the August 2014–March 2015 period. In real
effective terms, the euro appreciated by 3.7 percent
and the U.S. dollar by 2.3 percent between March
and August 2015, while the yen weakened slightly.
Exchange rate volatility increased in August, particu-

CHAPTER 1

Long-Term Interest Rates and Financial Conditions
Financial market volatility spiked in August, with an
increase in global risk aversion triggered by concerns
about China’s outlook, uncertainty about the implementation of its new exchange rate regime, and emerging market prospects more generally. This episode was
associated with lower equity prices, higher interest
rate spreads, declining yields on safe assets, and—as
discussed earlier—sharp declines in commodity prices
and currency depreciation for most emerging markets.
Longer-term sovereign bond yields are currently some
30 basis points higher than the level prevailing in April
in the United States and are up by 45–80 basis points
in the euro area (excluding Greece) over the same
period (Figure 1.4). Despite some increases in corporate bond spreads (modest for investment-grade firms
and larger for high-yield bonds), financial conditions
for corporate and household borrowers have remained
broadly favorable, with solid growth in household
credit in the United States and gradually improving
lending conditions in the euro area (Figure 1.5).
Higher yields partly reflect improving economic
activity and the bottoming out of headline inflation; in
the euro area, they also reflect a correction after earlier
declines to extremely compressed levels in response
to increased bond purchases by the European Central
Bank. On the policy rate front, the United States and
the United Kingdom are approaching liftoff, but a
number of other countries are easing monetary policy.
Namely, policy rates have been reduced in commodity exporters (Australia, Canada, New Zealand) and

Figure 1.4. Financial Conditions in Advanced Economies
(Percent, unless noted otherwise)

Financial market volatility spiked in August following an increase in global risk
aversion triggered by concerns about China’s growth outlook and emerging market
prospects more broadly. But ﬁnancial conditions have remained favorable in
advanced economies. Slightly higher yields on longer-term bonds primarily reﬂect
improving activity and the bottoming out of headline inﬂation.

larly after the depreciation of the renminbi associated
with the announced increase in exchange rate flexibility. Despite its 4 percent adjustment with respect to
the U.S. dollar, the renminbi remains some 10 percent
stronger than its 2014 average in real effective terms.
More generally, exchange rate movements across floating-rate currencies over the past year have reflected to
an important extent large variations in underlying fundamentals, such as expected demand growth at home
and in trading partners, declines in commodity prices,
and country-specific shocks. For instance, countries
with weakening growth prospects and worsening terms
of trade are facing currency depreciation pressures as
part of global adjustment. And as discussed in Chapter
3, countries experiencing sharp and persistent exchange
rate movements will likely see notable changes in net
external demand.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: ADJUSTING TO LOWER COMMODITY PRICES

Figure 1.5. Advanced Economies: Monetary Conditions
Markets still expect a policy rate liftoff in late 2015 in the United States, but
subsequent rate increases are expected to be more gradual. With more
accommodative monetary conditions in the euro area, the contraction in private
credit has started to bottom out. In the United States, household net worth has
stabilized at a higher level, and household debt continues to decrease.

International Monetary Fund | October 2015

in Korea, and Sweden has adopted and subsequently
expanded quantitative-easing measures.
Low long-term interest rates, easy monetary policy
conditions, and still-compressed spreads in advanced
economies support the recovery and have favorable
impacts on debt dynamics. But they also raise some
concern, as discussed in the October 2015 Global
Financial Stability Report (GFSR) and in the “Risks”
section of this chapter. Inflation expectations, particularly in the euro area and Japan, remain low, and
there is a risk they may drift downward if inflation
remains persistently weak. Financial stability concerns
associated with a protracted period of low interest rates
remain salient—particularly in advanced economies
with modest slack. Insurance companies and pension
funds face difficult challenges in this respect. And
compressed term premiums imply a potential risk of
a sharp increase in long-term rates, with significant
spillovers to emerging markets.
Financial conditions have in contrast tightened in
most emerging market and developing economies,
albeit very differently across countries and regions
(Figure 1.6). Corporate and sovereign dollar bond
spreads have risen by 40 to 50 basis points on average since the spring, and long-term local-currency
bond yields by close to 60 basis points on average.
Stock prices have weakened, and exchange rates have
depreciated or come under pressure, particularly in
commodity exporters. The evolution of policy rates in
recent months has also differed across regions, reflecting differences in inflation pressure, other domestic
macroeconomic conditions, and the external environment (Figure 1.7). Nominal policy rates have been
reduced in China and other countries in emerging
Asia (notably India) and in Russia, after the very sharp
increase in December 2014. In contrast, because of
increasing inflation, policy rates have risen further in
Brazil, while in the rest of the region they have been
stable or declining, reflecting the weakness in domestic
demand.

Longer-Term Factors
Productivity Growth in Advanced Economies
As highlighted in previous WEO reports, growth
has fallen short of forecasts over the past four years. A
comparison of output growth for advanced economies
for 2011–14 with the forecast in the April 2011 WEO
shows an aggregate overprediction over the horizon of

Monetary conditions generally remain accommodative in many emerging market
economies. Real policy rates are low, while currencies have depreciated in real
effective terms. However, in a number of emerging market economies with
inﬂationary pressures or external vulnerabilities, central banks have raised policy
rates. Real credit growth has slowed in many emerging market economies after
credit booms and rapid increases in credit-to-GDP ratios.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: ADJUSTING TO LOWER COMMODITY PRICES

Figure 1.8. Growth, Employment, and Labor Productivity in
Advanced Economies
(Percent)

Labor productivity growth in advanced economies has been much lower since the
global ﬁnancial crisis. The ﬂip side is that, since the crisis, the same rate of output
growth has, on average, been associated with higher employment growth (as
reﬂected in a higher slope coefﬁcient in the trend line). With relatively more
employment-intensive growth, unemployment has decreased noticeably in
economies that have experienced a sustained growth recovery.

about 1 percentage point. However, the overprediction of employment growth (0.3 percentage point) is
much lower. And for a range of economies—including
Germany, Japan, Korea, and the United Kingdom—
the overprediction of output growth has instead been
associated with an underprediction of employment
growth. In other words, labor productivity has fallen
well short of predictions.
Figure 1.8 looks at this issue in more detail. The
first two panels show the average relationship between
output growth and employment growth across countries, before and after the crisis. A comparison of these
panels highlights that both output growth and employment growth were much weaker in the period 2008–
14 relative to the precrisis period 1995–2007. The
panels also show that, on average, the same rate of
output growth has been associated since the crisis with
higher employment growth—but with much lower
output growth rates, employment growth since the crisis has nevertheless been weaker than before the crisis.
Adjusting employment growth for changes in hours
worked yields the same results.
The figure’s third panel compares labor productivity growth in advanced economies—proxied by the
difference between output growth and employment
growth—across the periods 1995–2007 and 2008–14.
It shows that while labor productivity growth still
varies substantially across countries, there has been a
common slowdown across virtually all countries—the
only exception being Spain (the only point above the
45-degree line in the panel), reflecting large changes
especially in temporary, lower-productivity jobs over
the cycle. Again, adjusting employment growth for
changes in hours worked leads to a virtually identical
picture.
The fourth panel of the figure compares the 2014
level of unemployment with the maximum level during
the period 2008–14. Although the recently elevated
“employment intensity” of growth has helped reduce
unemployment in a number of countries, the low rate
of output growth implies that unemployment is still
high and that output gaps are sizable in a number of
advanced economies.
What is behind the decline in labor productivity? Clearly weak investment after the crisis is playing a role, but as Chapter 3 of the April 2015 WEO
shows, slowing total factor productivity growth across
large advanced economies looks so far to be the most
important part of the explanation in most cases. In
turn, the reasons for slowing total factor productiv-

CHAPTER 1

ity growth across advanced economies are still poorly
understood (see for instance OECD 2015), but likely
include slower human capital accumulation, a compositional shift of GDP toward services, and—at least
for the United States—gradually declining positive
effects on productivity from the information and
communications technology revolution (Fernald 2014;
Gordon 2014).2
A key question is whether the protracted slowdown in growth and weak productivity growth could
also reflect the nature of the recent crisis, given the
literature on weak recoveries in the aftermath of severe
financial distress. Box 1.1 addresses this question by
focusing on more than 100 recessions in 23 advanced
economies since the 1960s. It finds that two-thirds of
recessions are followed by lower output relative to the
prerecession trend. Even more surprising, almost half
of those are followed not only by lower output, but
also by lower output growth relative to the prerecession
trend. The results discussed in the box raise important
policy questions—for instance, the extent to which
these effects reflect supply shocks or the erosion of
potential output coming from protracted downturns in
domestic demand. In the IMF staff’s view, both factors
are at play in accounting for lower potential growth,
and—despite lower potential growth—demand shortfalls are still sizable in a number of advanced economies (as shown, for instance, in the fourth panel of
Figure 1.8).
A Protracted Slowdown in Emerging Markets
After a strong rebound to almost 7½ percent after
the global financial crisis, real GDP growth in emerging market and developing economies decreased from
about 6.3 percent in 2011 to 4.6 percent in 2014.
In 2015, it is projected to decline further to 4 percent.
With this decline, growth for the entire group in 2014
was about 1 percentage point below the average growth
recorded during 1995–2007.
Larger deviations from the average in the major
emerging market economies heavily influenced these
outcomes for the group, which are calculated using
GDP weights. And among emerging market and
developing economies, the slowdown has not been
universal—for almost 40 percent of them, growth
2Some have argued that owing to rapid technological change,
especially in the information and communications technology sector,
conventional national income statistics increasingly understate the
true income level, but that view is not widely accepted.

Recent Developments and Prospects

in 2011–14 was above the 1995–2007 average.3
Against the backdrop of such variation, it should not
come as a surprise that slightly more than half of the
variation in the 2011–14 change in growth in emerging market and developing economies appears to have
resulted from country-specific factors. Such factors—
including, for example, supply bottlenecks and changes
in structural policies—have been discussed extensively
in previous WEO reports. The flip side is that slightly
less than half of the variation can be related to a set of
initial conditions and external factors.
An interesting feature of the decline in growth is
that in the first two years of the decline (2011–12),
external factors, notably lower partner country growth,
appear to have played a more important role than they
did subsequently in 2013–14.4 Changes in growth in
all partner countries seem to have been a more relevant
factor than changes in partner advanced economies
only, perhaps a reflection of increased trade within
the group of emerging market and developing economies. While the extent of direct trade exposure to
China does not seem to have been a significant factor
in explaining differences in growth declines across
economies, being a net commodity exporter appears to
have been a relevant factor: these economies experienced relatively larger growth declines, all else equal.
Still, as discussed in Chapter 2, the impact of commodity terms-of-trade fluctuations on both actual and
potential (medium-term) growth depends on a number
of factors, such as initial levels of financial development, how much fiscal policy smooths or exacerbates
the cycle, and exchange rate regimes. Typically, exporters with greater exchange rate flexibility experienced
smaller reductions in growth in 2011–14, which was
also true for other emerging market economies.
The growth slowdown also appears to reflect a
correction after years of exceptionally rapid growth
in the 2000s. Countries that recorded growth much
above longer-term averages around the time of the
global financial crisis slowed down more during 2011–
14 (“mean reversion”). This suggests that the protracted
slowdowns could in part also reflect adjustment to
various possible boom legacies, including an investment overhang and higher corporate sector leverage
after credit booms, as discussed in Chapter 3 of the
October 2015 GFSR.
3The analysis of forecast errors shows a similar picture, as discussed in Box 1.3 of the October 2014 WEO.
4Chapter 4 of the April 2014 WEO also finds an important role
for external shocks in the initial stages of the slowdown.

The Forecast

(Percent of GDP, unless noted otherwise)

Policy Assumptions

Fiscal consolidation is expected to moderate in most advanced economies over the
forecast horizon. However, in core euro area economies, the ﬁscal stance will be
slightly tighter relative to projections in the April 2015 World Economic Outlook (WEO),
while in some other euro area economies, it has eased relative to earlier projections.
In emerging market and developing economies, the ﬁscal policy stance is projected
to ease in 2015, but with considerable differences across countries.

Fiscal consolidation is projected to moderate in
advanced economies over the forecast horizon (Figure 1.9). In emerging markets, the fiscal policy stance
is projected to turn more expansionary to offset the
slowdown—albeit with marked differences across
countries and regions. On the monetary policy front,
U.S. policy rates are expected to increase beginning
in late 2015 (Figure 1.5). Monetary policy normalization in the United Kingdom is projected to begin
in 2016 (consistent with market expectations). Very
accommodative policy stances are expected to remain
in place for longer in Japan and also in the euro area,
where monthly purchases of government bonds started
March 9. Policy rates are generally expected to be on
hold in a number of emerging market economies until
rate increases start in the United States.

Global financial conditions are assumed to remain
accommodative, with some gradual tightening reflected
in, among other things, rising 10-year yields on
U.S. Treasury bonds as the expected date for liftoff from
the zero bound in the United States approaches. The
process of normalizing monetary policy in the United
States and the United Kingdom is assumed to proceed
smoothly, without large and protracted increases in
financial market volatility or sharp movements in longterm interest rates. Nevertheless, financial conditions in
emerging markets are assumed to be tighter than over
the past few months, reflecting the recent rise in spreads
and decline in equity prices, with some further increases
in long-term rates reflecting rising 10-year yields in
advanced economies. Oil prices are projected to increase
gradually over the forecast horizon, from an average of
$52 a barrel in 2015 to about $55 a barrel in 2017.
In contrast, nonfuel commodity prices are expected to
stabilize at lower levels after recent declines in both food
and metal prices. Geopolitical tensions are assumed to
stay elevated, with the situation around Ukraine remaining difficult and strife continuing in some countries in
the Middle East. These tensions are generally assumed to
ease, allowing for a gradual recovery in the most severely
affected economies in 2016–17.
Global Outlook for 2015–16
Global growth is projected to decline from 3.4 percent in 2014 to 3.1 percent in 2015, before picking

12

International Monetary Fund | October 2015

CHAPTER 1

up to 3.6 percent in 2016 (see Table 1.1). The decline
in growth this year reflects a further slowdown in
emerging markets, partially offset by a modest pickup
in activity in advanced economies—particularly in the
euro area. This pickup, supported by the decline in
oil prices (Figure 1.3) and accommodative monetary
policy, will modestly narrow output gaps.
The decline in growth in emerging markets—for the
fifth year in a row—reflects a combination of factors:
weaker growth in oil exporters; a slowdown in China,
as the pattern of growth becomes less reliant on investment; and a weaker outlook for exporters of other
commodities, including in Latin America, following
price declines. In emerging market oil importers, a
more limited pass-through to consumers of the windfall gains from lower oil prices, together with in some
cases substantial exchange rate depreciation, has muted
the attendant boost to growth, with lower prices accruing in part to governments (for example, in the form
of savings from lower energy subsidies—as discussed in
the April 2015 Fiscal Monitor).
The sizable pickup in projected 2016 growth reflects
stronger performance in both emerging market and
advanced economies. Among emerging market and
developing economies, growth in countries in economic distress in 2015 (including Brazil, Russia, and
some countries in Latin America and in the Middle
East), while remaining weak or negative, is projected
to be higher than in 2015, and domestic demand in
India is projected to remain strong. These developments more than offset the projected continuation of
the slowdown in China. Among advanced economies,
higher growth reflects a strengthening recovery in
Japan, the United States, and the euro area, as output
gaps gradually close.
The outlook is weaker than the one in the July 2015
WEO Update for both advanced economies and emerging markets. Relative to the April 2015 WEO, global
growth has been revised downward by 0.4 percentage
point in 2015 and 0.2 percentage point in 2016.
Global Outlook for the Medium Term
Global growth is forecast to increase beyond 2016,
entirely reflecting a further pickup in growth in emerging market and developing economies. This pickup
reflects two factors. The first is the assumption of a
gradual return to trend rates of growth in countries
and regions under stress or growing well below potential in 2015–16 (for example, Brazil and the rest of
Latin America, Russia, and parts of the Middle East).

Recent Developments and Prospects

The second factor is the gradual increase in the
global weight of fast-growing countries such as China
and India, which further increases their importance as
drivers of global growth.
On the other hand, growth in advanced economies
is projected to remain at about 2¼ percent as output
gaps gradually close, and then to decline below 2
percent, reflecting the gradual effects of demographics
on labor supply and hence on potential output, which
were discussed in Chapter 3 of the April 2015 WEO.
Economic Outlook for Individual Countries and

States, supported by lower energy prices, reduced
fiscal drag, strengthened balance sheets, and an
improving housing market (Figure 1.10, panel 1).
These forces are expected to more than offset the
drag on net exports coming from the strengthening of the dollar. As a result, growth is projected to
reach 2.6 percent in 2015 and 2.8 percent in 2016.
However, longer-term growth prospects are weaker,
with potential growth estimated to be only about
2 percent, weighed down by an aging population
and low total factor productivity growth (which
recent revisions to national accounts suggest was
lower than previously thought during 2012–14).
•• The moderate euro area recovery is projected to
continue in 2015–16, sustained by lower oil prices,
monetary easing, and the euro depreciation (Figure
1.10, panel 2). At the same time, potential growth
remains weak—a result of crisis legacies, but also
of demographics and a slowdown in total factor
productivity that predates the crisis (see Chapter
3). Hence the outlook is for moderate growth and
subdued inflation. Growth is expected to increase
from 0.9 percent in 2014 to 1.5 percent this year
and 1.6 percent in 2016, in line with the forecast
of last April. Growth is forecast to pick up for 2015
and 2016 in France (1.2 percent in 2015 and
1.5 percent in 2016), Italy (0.8 percent in 2015 and
1.3 percent in 2016), and especially Spain (3.1 percent in 2015 and 2.5 percent in 2016). In Germany,
growth is expected to remain at about 1½ percent
(1.5 percent in 2015 and 1.6 percent in 2016). The
outlook for Greece is markedly more difficult following the protracted period of uncertainty earlier
in the year.
•• In Japan GDP growth is projected to rise from
–0.1 percent in 2014 to 0.6 percent in 2015 and

(Annualized quarterly percent change)

In advanced economies, growth is expected to remain robust and above trend
through 2016 and contribute to narrowing the output gap. The growth recovery in
the euro area is projected to be broad based. Growth in India is expected to rise
above the rates in other major emerging market economies. In Latin America and
the Caribbean, activity is expected to rebound in 2016 after a recession in 2015.

International Monetary Fund | October 2015

1.0 percent in 2016 (Figure 1.10, panel 1). The
gradual pickup reflects support from higher real
compensation and higher equity prices due to the
Bank of Japan’s additional quantitative and qualitative easing, as well as lower oil and commodity
prices.
•• In other advanced economies, growth is generally
expected to be solid, but weaker than in 2014. In
the United Kingdom, continued steady growth is
expected (2.5 percent in 2015 and 2.2 percent in
2016), supported by lower oil prices and continued
recovery in wage growth. The recovery in Sweden
(2.8 percent growth projected in 2015) is supported
by consumption and double-digit housing investment. In Switzerland, the sharp exchange rate appreciation earlier in the year is projected to depress
growth in the near term (1.0 percent in 2015).
In commodity exporters, lower commodity prices
weigh on the outlook through reduced disposable
income and a decline in resource-related investment.
The latter mechanism has been particularly sharply
felt in Canada, where growth is now projected to
be about 1 percent in 2015, 1.2 percentage points
lower than forecast in April. Australia’s projected
growth of 2.4 percent in 2015, a bit weaker than
predicted in April, also reflects the impact of lower
commodity prices and resource-related investment—partly offset by supportive monetary policy
and a weaker exchange rate. In Norway GDP is
projected to grow by 0.9 percent this year as the fall
in oil prices is reflected in stalling investment and
weakening consumption. Among Asian advanced
economies, growth is generally weaker than in 2014,
reflecting domestic shocks and slower exports. The
decline in growth relative to last year is particularly
noticeable for Taiwan Province of China (from 3.8
percent to 2.2 percent), where exports have been
slowing especially sharply.
•• Growth in China is expected to decline to 6.8 percent this year and 6.3 percent in 2016—unchanged
projections relative to April (Figure 1.10, panel 3).
Previous excesses in real estate, credit, and investment continue to unwind, with a further moderation in the growth rates of investment, especially
that in residential real estate. The forecast assumes
that policy action will be consistent with reducing
vulnerabilities from recent rapid credit and investment growth and hence not aim at fully offsetting
the underlying moderation in activity. Ongoing

CHAPTER 1

implementation of structural reforms and lower oil
and other commodity prices are expected to expand
consumer-oriented activities, partly buffering the
slowdown. The decline in stock market valuations is
assumed to have only a modest effect on consumption (reflecting modest household holdings), and
the current episode of financial market volatility is
assumed to unwind without sizable macroeconomic
disruptions.
•• Elsewhere in emerging and developing Asia, India’s
growth is expected to strengthen from 7.3 percent
this year and last year to 7.5 percent next year.
Growth will benefit from recent policy reforms, a
consequent pickup in investment, and lower commodity prices. Among the ASEAN-5 economies
(Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam), Malaysia and to a lesser extent Indonesia are
expected to slow this year, affected by weaker terms
of trade. Growth is on the other hand projected to
pick up in Thailand, as a result of reduced policy
uncertainty, to remain broadly stable at around 6
percent in the Philippines, and to strengthen to 6.5
percent in Vietnam, which is benefiting from the oil
price windfall.
•• Economic activity in Latin America and the Caribbean continues to slow sharply, with a small
contraction in activity in 2015 (Figure 1.10, panel
4). A modest recovery is projected for 2016, but
with growth at 0.8 percent, still well below trend.
Growth projections have been revised downward
by more than 1 percentage point in both 2015
and 2016 relative to the April 2015 WEO. The
bleaker outlook for commodity prices interacts in
some countries with strained initial conditions. In
Brazil, business and consumer confidence continue
to retreat in large part because of deteriorating
political conditions, investment is declining rapidly,
and the needed tightening in the macroeconomic
policy stance is putting downward pressure on
domestic demand. Output is now projected to
contract by 3 percent in 2015 and by 1 percent in
2016 (for both years, a forecast 2 percentage points
lower than in April), with negative spillovers on
other parts of the region, especially Brazil's trading
partners in Mercosur. Venezuela is projected to experience a deep recession in 2015 and 2016 (–10 percent and –6 percent, respectively), because the oil
price decline since mid-June 2014 has exacerbated
domestic macroeconomic imbalances and balance of

Recent Developments and Prospects

payments pressures. Venezuelan inflation is projected
to be well above 100 percent in 2015. A modest
decline in activity is now projected for Ecuador,
where 2015 growth has been revised downward by
more than 2 percentage points, reflecting the impact
of lower oil prices coupled with sizable real appreciation driven by the stronger U.S. dollar. Additional
weakness in metal prices is projected to dampen
the growth recovery in Chile and Peru, while the
projected deceleration in Colombia reflects the drop
in oil prices.
•• Projections for economies in the Commonwealth
of Independent States remain very weak, reflecting
the recession in Russia with its attendant regional
spillovers, as well as a very sharp further contraction
in Ukraine. Overall, activity is projected to contract
by 2.7 percent, after growing by 1 percent in 2014.
The outlook is projected to improve in 2016, with
a return to positive growth (0.5 percent). In Russia
the economy is expected to contract by 3.8 percent
this year, reflecting the interaction of falling oil
prices and international sanctions with preexisting structural weaknesses. Output is projected to
decline further in 2016. The projected 0.1 percent
contraction in the remainder of the region this year
reflects to an important extent the deep recession
in Ukraine (–9 percent), where positive growth is
expected to return in 2016, supported by the beginning of reconstruction. Elsewhere in the region,
especially in the Caucasus and Central Asia, activity
will be held back by lower commodity prices and
spillovers from Russia (through trade, foreign direct
investment, and especially remittances), which will
interact with existing structural vulnerabilities.
•• Growth in emerging and developing Europe is projected to rise modestly to 3.0 percent in 2015–16.
The region has benefited from lower oil prices and
the gradual recovery in the euro area, but is also
affected by the contraction in Russia and the impact
of still-elevated corporate debt on investment. The
latter, together with political uncertainty, is expected
to weigh on domestic demand in Turkey, where the
growth of activity is projected to remain at about
3 percent in 2015–16. Growth remains relatively
robust in central and eastern Europe, with Hungary
and Poland growing at rates of 3 percent or higher
in 2015, but weaker in southeastern Europe (with
the exception of Romania), with growth in Bulgaria,
Croatia, and Serbia below 2 percent.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: ADJUSTING TO LOWER COMMODITY PRICES

•• Growth across the Middle East, North Africa,
Afghanistan, and Pakistan is forecast to remain
modest in 2015 at 2.5 percent, slightly below last
year. Spillovers from regional conflicts and intensified security and social tensions are weighing on
confidence and holding back higher growth. Low
oil prices are also taking a toll on the outlook for oil
exporters. In oil importers, the recovery is strengthening. Headwinds from weak confidence are being
offset by gains from lower oil prices, economic
reforms, and improved euro area growth. Regional
growth is projected to pick up substantially in 2016,
supported by accelerated activity in the Islamic
Republic of Iran, where the lifting of sanctions—
once the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action
becomes binding and is implemented—should allow
for a recovery in oil production and exports, as well
as by a gradual improvement in the outlook for
countries severely affected by conflicts, such as Iraq,
Libya, and Yemen. Compared with the April 2015
projections, the outlook for 2015 is weaker, reflecting the collapse in activity in Yemen and a further decline in GDP in Libya, but looks stronger
for 2016, primarily on account of the improved
prospects for the Islamic Republic of Iran.
•• Growth in sub-Saharan Africa is expected to slow
this year to 3.8 percent (from 5.0 percent in 2014,
a 0.7 percentage point downward revision relative to April). The slowdown in 2015 is primarily
driven by the repercussions of declining commodity prices, particularly those for oil, as well as
lower demand from China—the largest single trade
partner of sub-Saharan Africa—and the tightening of global financial conditions for the region’s
frontier market economies. Among the region’s
oil exporters, Nigeria’s growth is now projected
at 4 percent in 2015, some 2¼ percentage points
lower than last year, and growth in Angola is also
expected to decline to 3.5 percent from close to
5 percent in 2014. Among the region’s oil importers—projected to grow at 4 percent on average—a
majority will continue to experience solid growth,
especially low-income countries, where investment
in infrastructure continues and private consumption
remains strong. Countries such as Côte d’Ivoire, the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Mozambique, and Tanzania are still expected to register
growth of about 7 percent or above this year and
next. But others, such as Sierra Leone and Zambia,
are feeling the pinch from lower prices for their
16

International Monetary Fund | October 2015

main export commodity, even as lower oil prices
relieve their energy import bill. South Africa’s growth
is projected to be below 1½ percent both this year
and next, reflecting ­electricity-load shedding and
other supply bottlenecks. In Ghana, power shortages and fiscal consolidation are also weighing on
activity, which is projected to slow further in 2015
to 3.5 percent. Growth for the region is projected
to pick up in 2016 to 4.3 percent, with the global
recovery supporting a moderate pickup in external
demand, the modest recovery in oil prices benefiting
oil exporters, and an improvement in the outlook
for Ebola-affected countries.
•• Growth in low-income developing countries is
projected to slow to 4.8 percent in 2015, more than
1 percentage point weaker than in 2014, before
picking up to 5.8 percent in 2016. These projections are shaped by the outlook for sub-Saharan
economies, in particular Nigeria; the resilient
growth in low-income developing countries in Asia,
particularly Bangladesh and Vietnam; and for 2015,
the domestic-conflict-driven collapse in activity in
Yemen.
Global Inflation
Inflation is projected to decline in 2015 in advanced
economies, reflecting primarily the impact of lower
oil prices. The pass-through of lower oil prices into
core inflation is expected to remain moderate, in line
with recent episodes of large changes in commodity
prices. In emerging market and developing economies,
the inflation rate is projected to increase in 2015, but
this reflects the sharp increase in the inflation forecast
for Venezuela (more than 100 percent in 2015) and
Ukraine (about 50 percent). Excluding these countries,
inflation in emerging market and developing economies in 2015 is projected to decline from 4.5 percent
in 2014 to 4.2 percent in 2015.
In advanced economies, inflation is projected to
rise in 2016 and thereafter, but to remain generally
below central bank targets. In emerging market and
developing economies, inflation is projected to decline
in 2016, with markedly lower inflation in countries
that experienced sizable depreciation in recent months,
such as Russia and to a lesser extent Brazil.
•• In the euro area, headline inflation is projected to
be 0.2 percent in 2015, slightly lower than in 2014.
After dipping below zero in December 2014
and remaining negative through the first quarter
of 2015, inflation picked up in the second quarter

CHAPTER 1

of 2015, reflecting a modest recovery in economic
activity, the partial reversal in oil prices, and the
impact of the euro depreciation. Inflation expectations, while higher than in the first quarter, remain
low, although core measures point to tentative signs
of an upturn in underlying inflation. Headline inflation is projected to increase to 1 percent in 2016,
but is expected to remain subdued through the
medium term.
•• In Japan, several factors will put upward pressure
on the price level, including the lagged impact of
the recent yen weakening and the closing of the
output gap. Continued tightening of the labor
market could accelerate favorable wage-price
dynamics. As a result, under current policies,
inflation is expected to rise gradually to 1½ percent over the medium term.
•• In the United States, annual inflation in 2015 is
projected to decline to 0.1 percent. After a sharp
decline in late 2014 and early 2015 that reflected
lower energy prices, it has started to increase gradually, even though the effects of dollar appreciation,
muted wage dynamics, and the renewed bout of
declines in oil prices act as a headwind. Inflation is
then projected to rise gradually toward the Federal
Reserve’s longer-term objective of 2 percent.
•• Inflation is projected to remain well below target in
a number of other smaller advanced economies—
especially in Europe and east Asia. In particular, consumer prices are projected to decline in
both 2015 and 2016 in Switzerland, following the
sharp appreciation of the currency in January. Inflation remains subdued in the Czech Republic, New
Zealand, and Sweden, but is projected to gradually
rise toward the target over 2016–17.
In emerging market economies, the decline in oil
prices and a slowdown in activity are contributing to
lower inflation in 2015, even though not all of the
decline in the price of oil will be passed on to enduser prices. At the same time, however, large nominal exchange rate depreciations are putting upward
pressure on prices in several countries, particularly
commodity exporters. In subsequent years the effect of
lower oil prices is expected to phase out, but this effect
is projected to be offset by a phasing out of the effect
of large depreciations as well as by a gradual decline
in underlying inflation toward medium-term inflation
targets.
•• In China, consumer price index inflation is forecast
to be 1.5 percent in 2015—reflecting the decline

Recent Developments and Prospects

in commodity prices, the sharp real appreciation
of the renminbi, and some weakening in domestic
demand—but to increase gradually thereafter.
•• In India, inflation is expected to decline further in 2015, reflecting the fall in global oil and
agricultural commodity prices. In Brazil, average
inflation is expected to rise to 8.9 percent this year,
above the ceiling of the tolerance band, reflecting
an adjustment of regulated prices and exchange
rate depreciation, and to converge toward the
4.5 percent target over the following two years.
In contrast, inflation is projected to rise to about
16 percent in 2015 in Russia, reflecting the large
depreciation of the ruble, and to decline below
9 percent next year. In Turkey, inflation for 2015 is
projected at about 7½ percent, some 2½ percentage points above target.
•• A few emerging markets are projected to experience
headline inflation well below target in 2015, with
modest increases in 2016. These include in particular a number of small European countries whose
currencies are tightly linked to the euro.
External Sector Developments
World trade growth is projected to remain modest, as in the past two years (Figure 1.11, panel 1). A
pickup in trade is forecast for advanced economies.
For emerging markets import growth is projected to
decline further, reflecting weakening domestic demand
and depreciating exchange rates, but export growth is
projected to increase, sustained by higher oil exports
from the Middle East and the pickup of domestic
demand in advanced economies.
Capital flows to and from advanced economies
remained modest relative to their precrisis trends during 2014, but showed signs of a pickup in early 2015.
After a sustained period of strength, capital flows
to emerging markets have been declining since the
end of 2013 (Figure 1.12, panels 1 and 2). This has
reflected to an important extent reductions in capital inflows to China and Russia, but also declining
flows to other countries and regions, including Latin
America. With no large change in the aggregate current account balance for emerging market and developing economies, the decline in inflows has been offset
by a corresponding decline in these economies’ net
purchases of foreign assets (Figure 1.12, panel 4). Large
emerging market economies as a group sold about
$100 billion in foreign exchange reserves during both
the last quarter of 2014 and the first quarter of 2015,

Global trade volumes weakened more than GDP in the ﬁrst half of 2015,
highlighting that economic growth in the services and other nontradables sectors
has been relatively stronger than in the tradables sectors. Global current account
imbalances are expected to narrow further over the forecast horizon, with most of
the contribution coming from smaller surpluses in oil exporters. In contrast, global
creditor and debtor positions have increased further as a share of world GDP.

with net sales of foreign reserves by China, Russia, and
Saudi Arabia representing the lion’s share.5
Current account deficits and surpluses across the
main creditor and debtor regions declined further
in 2014, albeit relatively modestly (Figure 1.12, panel
2). Nevertheless, global creditor and debtor positions,
as measured by net international investment positions,
continued to grow in 2014 as a share of world GDP
(Figure 1.12, panel 3). Valuation effects play an important role in explaining such widening. Specifically, the
appreciation of the U.S. dollar and the increase in the
value of U.S. assets related to interest rate and equity
price movements have increased the net external liabilities of the United States and symmetrically boosted
asset values in holders of U.S. financial instruments.
Projections for 2015 suggest changes in the composition of global current account deficits and surpluses, reflecting the impact of declining prices of oil
and other commodities, as well as the large exchange
rate movements that have taken place since last year.
As discussed in Chapter 3, the evidence suggests
that exchange rate movements continue to have an
economically significant impact on external balances. However, the aggregate size of global current
account deficits and surpluses will remain broadly
stable. Specifically, the contraction in the surpluses
of oil-exporting countries will continue to be broadly
offset by increasing surpluses in oil importers such as
European surplus countries as well as in China, while
the reduction in deficits for some oil importers is and
will remain offset by a deteriorating current account
balance in the United States.
From a normative perspective, there is of course no
presumption that current account deficits and surpluses
should necessarily decline. But as discussed in the 2015
External Sector Report (IMF 2015a), a number of
countries’ 2014 current account imbalances appear too
large relative to a country-specific norm consistent with
external stability. These countries have made limited
progress in reducing the excess imbalances remaining
after the large narrowing of imbalances in the aftermath
of the global financial crisis. As discussed earlier, external
balances in 2015 are affected by substantial shocks,
including changes in commodity prices and large fluctuations in exchange rates. Panel 3 of Figure 1.13 depicts
5The decline in the stock of reserves for emerging market and
developing economies overstates the amount of actual sales because
of valuation effects. Namely, the appreciation of the U.S. dollar with
respect to most other reserve currencies in recent quarters implies a
decline in the stock of reserves measured in U.S. dollars.

Recent Developments and Prospects

projected changes in current account balances relative
to GDP in 2015 in relation to the current account gaps
for 2014 discussed in the 2015 External Sector Report.6
The figure shows a modest general tendency for current
account balances to move in the direction of narrowing 2014 current account gaps, but with large economies such as China, Germany, and the United States
being notable exceptions, such gaps would not narrow
on a global scale. Panel 2 of Figure 1.13 undertakes
the same exercise for real effective exchange rates, and
it shows that exchange rate changes in 2015 relative to
their 2014 average are not systematically consistent with
a reduction in the exchange rate gaps identified for 2014
by the 2015 External Sector Report. Of course a normative assessment of external balances and exchange rates
must also take into account changes in the underlying
current account and real exchange rate “norms” as well,
and such an assessment will be undertaken in next year’s
External Sector Report.
More generally, a desirable pattern of global
rebalancing would depend not just on exchange rate
changes and their attendant current account implications, but on policies underpinning desirable shifts to
relative demand and consistent with sustaining world
growth.
Although the compression of global current account
imbalances following the global financial crisis has
been discussed extensively (see, for instance, Chapter
4 of the October 2014 WEO), large current account
surpluses and deficits in smaller countries have received
less attention. Their number—especially the number
of deficits—remains elevated. During 2012–14, more
than 80 countries ran current account deficits that
exceeded 5 percent of GDP but altogether accounted
for only 3½ percent of world GDP. For comparison,
during 2005–08 the number of countries with current
account deficits above 5 percent of GDP was only
slightly larger (90), but they accounted for a share of
world GDP that was larger by a factor of 10. And the
number of countries running large surpluses is much
smaller than in the previous period. Box 1.2 discusses
the characteristics of countries that have run large
current account deficits in recent years in more detail,
highlighting a variety of different drivers (ranging
from domestic shocks to commodity price booms to
increased access to external finance after debt forgive6These gaps measure deviations of current account balances from a
level consistent with underlying fundamentals and desirable policies.
Real exchange rate gaps are defined analogously.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: ADJUSTING TO LOWER COMMODITY PRICES

Figure 1.13. Real Exchange Rates and Current Account Gaps
Currencies of many major emerging market economies have depreciated further in
real effective terms since the projections for the April 2015 World Economic Outlook
(WEO) were prepared, reﬂecting to an important extent weaker fundamentals,
notably weakening growth prospects and worsening terms of trade. As for external
imbalances, the assessment in the 2015 External Sector Report is that these
remained too large in 2014 relative to underlying norms. WEO projections suggest
some general tendency for the expected current account balances in 2015 to move
in the direction of narrowing the implied 2014 current account gaps. However, in
some large economies, including China, Germany, and the United States, no
narrowing is expected.

ness) within the general tendency for poor countries,
as well as for small countries (in terms of population),
to run current account deficits. Box 1.3 addresses a
related question—namely, the impact of capital flows
to low-income developing countries on those countries’ credit growth. Its findings suggest an important
influence of external financial conditions on domestic
credit expansion in those countries. Clearly, reliance on
external finance among countries with pressing development needs and high rates of return on investment
is to be expected. However, given declining commodity
prices and worsening external conditions, these two
boxes suggest that some countries that relied heavily on
private external financing may face significant external
adjustment pressures in the future.

Risks
The distribution of risks to global growth remains
tilted to the downside. Compared to the risk assessment in the April 2015 WEO, downside risks to
growth for emerging market and developing economies
have increased, given the combination of risks from
China’s growth transition, more protracted commodity market rebalancing, increased foreign-currency
exposure of corporate balance sheets, and capital flow
reversals associated with disruptive asset price shifts.
In advanced economies, contagion risks from Greecerelated events to other euro area economies, while
lower than earlier in the year, remain a concern, as do
risks from protracted weak demand and low inflation.
Oil price declines since June (and lagged effects from
previous declines) could imply some upside risk to
domestic demand and growth in oil importers.

The Fan Chart: Risks around the Global GDP Forecast
The fan chart for the global GDP forecast suggests
that the confidence interval around the projected path
for global growth in 2016 has narrowed, especially on
the upside (Figure 1.14, panel 1). Hence, high growth
outcomes much above the baseline forecast are now less
likely compared to what they were in the April 2015
WEO.7
The smaller probability of growth outcomes much
above the baseline is consistent with the view that an

either on prices of derivatives or on the distribution of forecasts for
the underlying variables.

CHAPTER 1

even stronger growth rebound above trend than is
already incorporated in current forecasts is unlikely in
advanced economies. Productivity growth has turned
out weaker than expected, and potential output growth
is projected to remain substantially below precrisis rates
(see the discussion earlier and in Box 1.1). In addition,
downside risks to growth in many major emerging
market economies have increased.
While upside risks from large positive growth surprises have decreased, the probability of global growth
falling below 2 percent remains small and broadly
unchanged relative to that in the April 2015 WEO.
Simulations using the IMF’s Global Projection Model,
which draw on past shocks over a longer horizon,
suggest a small increase in the probability of a recession in the major advanced economies and in the Latin
America 5 economies over a four-quarter horizon relative to April 2015 (Figure 1.15, panel 1). This increase
primarily reflects the lower starting values for growth
for some of the economies and the somewhat lower
growth forecast under the baseline. With the latter, the
probability of negative shocks leading to a technical
recession is higher compared to a situation in which
the baseline forecast is stronger.

Recent Developments and Prospects

Figure 1.14. Risks to the Global Outlook
The fan chart, which indicates the degree of uncertainty about the global growth
outlook, suggests that upside risks to the forecast have narrowed compared to the
April 2015 World Economic Outlook (WEO), while the distribution of downside risks
is broadly unchanged. The distribution of the risks to the forecast for global growth
is thus tilted more to the downside. Measures of forecast dispersion and implied
volatility for equity and oil prices as well as the term spread in major advanced
economies suggest an increase in perceived uncertainty about key variables for
the global outlook.

Risks to the Global Outlook
Downside risks differ between advanced and emerging market economies to some extent. However, there
would be spillovers if any of the risks discussed in
this subsection materialized, and these spillovers, as
illustrated in Scenario Box 1 and in the October 2015
GFSR, could be substantial. In regard to upside risks,
lower oil and commodity prices could have a stronger
impact on demand than currently expected (including
through lagged effects of earlier price declines).
Disruptive Asset Price Shifts and Financial Market
Turmoil
As elaborated in the October 2015 GFSR, disruptive asset price shifts and financial turmoil could take
a toll on global activity. Emerging market economies
are particularly exposed, as these risks, if they materialized, could involve capital flow reversals. Four factors
underpin these risks.
• Term premiums and risk premiums in bond markets
are still very low by historical standards. Estimates
of the term premium on longer-term U.S. Treasury
bonds suggest that it turned negative in late 2014,

economies are also low if not negative. A correction
to higher term premiums in the United States could
lead to sharply higher yields abroad, given the strong
linkages among longer-term bond yields.8
• The context underlying this asset price configuration—in particular, very accommodative monetary
policies in the major advanced economies, as well
as crisis legacies and deflation risks—is expected to
start changing with improved recovery prospects in
8See,

International Monetary Fund | October 2015

those economies. Deflation risks, for example, which
appear to have partly underpinned very low bond
term premiums, should decrease as output gaps
close. Under the baseline, the change in term premiums is assumed to be gradual, but news that changes
expectations about these fault lines and unexpected
portfolio shifts could trigger disruptive asset price
adjustments. These adjustments might be related to
the start and especially the pace of monetary policy
normalization in the United States, also in light of
the remaining divergence between market expectations and estimates by members of the Federal Open
Market Committee about the path of U.S. policy
rates over the next few years.
• Vulnerabilities and financial stability risks in
emerging market economies have likely increased
amid lower growth, recent commodity price
declines, and increased leverage after years of
rapid credit growth. Hence, unfavorable news in
these areas could trigger higher risk premiums and
disruptive declines in emerging market asset prices
and currency values.
• Financial market reaction to the protracted uncertainties surrounding the negotiations for a new
financing program with Greece was limited, reflecting the strength of euro area firewalls and European
Central Bank policies, as well as declining systemic
linkages with Greece. Risks have diminished since
the agreement on a new European Stability Mechanism program for Greece, but should policy and
political uncertainty reemerge in Greece, sovereign
and financial sector stress in the euro area could also
reemerge, with potentially broader spillovers.
Lower Potential Output
Potential output is projected to grow at a rate
lower than it did before the crisis, in both advanced
and emerging market economies.9 Risks are that the
growth rate of potential output could be even lower
than expected. Indeed, recent revisions in U.S. national
accounts data suggest that productivity growth in
recent years was weaker than estimated previously. That
said, the growth rate of potential output will likely
continue to differ between advanced and emerging
market economies even if this risk materializes. In the
latter, potential output growth will remain substantially
9Chapter 3 of the April 2015 WEO discusses prospects for
potential output in major advanced and emerging market economies
in more detail.

CHAPTER 1

higher than in the former, given demographic trends
and the forces of convergence in per capita income.
Some of the forces underlying the risks of lower
potential output growth are the same in the two
groups of economies, while others differ.
•• In terms of common forces, lower capital stock
growth is a concern in both groups. In advanced
economies, the protracted crisis legacies—notably
financial sector weakness, still-high public debt
ratios, and private debt overhang—are the main
concern. In emerging market economies, the
concerns are structural constraints, less favorable
external conditions for investment, notably tighter
financial conditions and lower commodity prices,
and a possible greater credit overhang after the
recent credit booms. As a result, capital stock growth
could be lower for longer, which, in turn, might
also lower productivity growth at least temporarily
because of capital-embodied technological progress.
•• In terms of differences, risks of negative productivity
effects from longer-lasting high unemployment (skill
losses, lower labor force participation) apply primarily to advanced economies. Conversely, lower total
factor productivity growth than expected under current convergence assumptions is primarily a concern
for emerging market economies.
Risks to Growth in China
Growth has slowed in China in recent years, and
a further moderate slowdown has been factored into
the baseline projections. There are risks of a stronger
growth slowdown if the macroeconomic management of the end of the investment and credit boom
of 2009–12 proves more challenging than expected.
Risks span a broad spectrum, with real and financial spillovers, including through commodity market
channels:
• A moderate growth shortfall: Given risks of a further
growth slowdown in the future and expectations of
policy reforms that may increase input and capital costs, firms may lower investment more than
expected. But unlike in 2013–14, the Chinese
authorities could put greater weight on reducing
vulnerabilities from recent rapid credit and investment growth, rather than on supporting growth.
• Hard landing in China: In this case, the authorities
would use their policy space to prevent growth from
slowing by shoring up investment through credit
and public resources. Vulnerability from booming credit and investment would thus continue to

Recent Developments and Prospects

increase, and policy space would shrink. This could
mean a sharper growth slowdown in the medium
term when the vulnerabilities would be more difficult to manage.
Lower Commodity Prices
Prices of commodities have fallen sharply in recent
months. They could fall further if market rebalancing
in response to recent excess supply conditions were
to take longer than expected.10 Growth in commodity exporters would be negatively affected, and their
vulnerabilities would increase further in light of lower
revenue and foreign exchange earnings. In commodity importers, however, the windfall gains from
lower commodity prices from more persistent supply
improvements would lower costs and increase real
incomes, which should boost spending and activity,
as discussed in the April 2015 WEO for the case of
oil. In that case, the spending increases by importers
should more than offset lower spending in exporters, as
the latter tend to smooth spending more in the aggregate, and global demand would increase (see Husain
and others 2015). The case is less clear-cut for other
commodities: exporters of metals may not smooth
spending to the same extent as oil exporters, given that
exhaustibility considerations generally play a smaller
role for the former.
However, possible nonlinear effects of lower commodity prices are a concern. Specifically, if lower prices
also led to significant financial stress, defaults, and
broad contagion among commodity exporters, the
negative impact on activity in these economies would
be larger, as exporters might not be able to smooth
spending to the extent they would otherwise. This
would also lead to larger adverse spillovers to commodity importers.
A Further Sizable Strengthening of the U.S. Dollar
The constellation underpinning dollar appreciation over the past year or so is expected to remain in
place for some time in the baseline forecast. It includes
domestic demand strength relative to most other
advanced economies, monetary policy divergence among
major advanced economies, and an improved external
position with lower oil prices. U.S. dollar appreciation
10Specifically, the demand increases in response to lower prices or
capacity adjustment through lower investment might be very gradual. In the meantime, spot prices might have to fall more relative to
expected future prices, so as to create incentives for further inventory
buildup to absorb excess flow supply in the meantime.

International Monetary Fund | October 2015

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: ADJUSTING TO LOWER COMMODITY PRICES

against most currencies could thus continue, causing a
lasting upswing in the dollar, as has happened previously. If this risk were to materialize, balance sheet and
funding strains for dollar debtors could potentially
more than offset trade benefits from real depreciation in
some economies. In addition, if dollar appreciation were
driven by increases in longer-term bond yields, the latter
would likely be transmitted rapidly to other economies,
which might negatively affect the interest-sensitive components of domestic demand. Balance sheet and funding
constraints are a particular concern for emerging market
economies with considerable international financial
integration, in which—as discussed in the 2015 Spillover
Report (IMF 2015b) and the October 2015 GFSR—
foreign-currency corporate debt has increased substantially over the past few years. Much of the increase
has been in the energy sector, in which a high share
of revenue in U.S. dollars provides a natural hedge,
although increased leverage in the sector remains a
concern, especially if energy prices were to fall while the
dollar appreciated. In addition, foreign-currency debt is
also higher in firms operating in sectors without natural
revenue hedges, especially the nontradables sector.
Geopolitical Risks
Ongoing events around Ukraine, the Middle
East, and parts of Africa could lead to escalation in
tensions and increased disruptions in global trade
and financial transactions. Disruptions in energy
and other commodity markets remain a particular
concern, given the possibility of sharp price spikes,
which, depending on their duration, could substantially lower real incomes and demand in importers.
More generally, an escalation of such tensions could
take a toll on confidence.
Secular Stagnation and Hysteresis
The risk of a protracted shortfall of domestic
demand associated with excess saving (discussed in
more detail in a scenario analysis in the October 2014
WEO) will remain a concern. In some advanced economies, especially in the euro area, demand continues
to be relatively weak, and output gaps are still large.
Inflation is expected to stay below target beyond the
usual monetary policy horizons, and deflation risks—
while lower than in April—remain elevated amid crisis
legacies and constraints on monetary policy at the
zero lower bound (Figure 1.15, panel 2). Furthermore,
after six years of demand weakness, the likelihood of
damage to potential output is increasingly a concern,
24

International Monetary Fund | October 2015

and the considerations previously presented under risks
from lower potential output apply.
A Combined Risk Scenario
The possible global repercussions of a generalized slowdown in emerging market and developing
economies are presented in Scenario Box 1. The
scenario includes the materialization of a number of
risks highlighted earlier—a slowdown in investment
and growth across emerging market economies, more
severe in faster-growing economies such as China and
India; lower commodity prices, arising from this slowdown; and higher risk premiums and exchange rate
depreciation across emerging market economies. The
implications for growth in emerging market economies and developing countries would be sizable, with
growth rates 1.5 to 2 percentage points lower after five
years—even though the model assumes no “sudden
stop” in capital flows or crisis outcomes with contagion
effects. Spillovers onto advanced economies would also
be material, with growth about 0.2 to 0.3 percentage
point lower after five years, depending on whether risk
aversion toward emerging market assets increases, and
a sizable deterioration in current account balances,
despite the partial offset from lower commodity prices.

Policies
Raising actual and potential output continues to be
a general policy priority. Specific policy requirements
vary from country group to country group and among
individual countries, although there is a broad need for
structural reforms in many economies, advanced and
emerging market alike. In this regard, more countries should capitalize on the opportunities that lower
energy prices offer to reform energy subsidies and taxes.
Addressing external vulnerabilities is also of the essence
in a number of emerging market and developing economies facing a more difficult external environment.

Policies for Full Employment and Stable Inflation in
Advanced Economies
With nominal policy rates still at or close to the
zero lower bound in many countries, reducing risks to
activity from low inflation and prolonged demand deficiency remains a priority for macroeconomic policy.
In particular, to prevent real interest rates from rising
prematurely, monetary policy must stay accommodative, including through unconventional measures (such

CHAPTER 1

Recent Developments and Prospects

Scenario Box 1. A Structural Slowing in Emerging Market Economies
Two simulations employing the IMF’s G20 Model
are used to examine the global impact of a strongerthan-expected slowing in potential output growth in
emerging market economies. In both simulations, investors expect lower growth in the future, because of slower
catching up and lower productivity growth, as well as
because of lower capital inflows and tighter financial
conditions. Hence, they reduce investment expenditure
relative to the World Economic Outlook (WEO) baseline
projections, resulting in weaker domestic demand in
emerging market economies. In particular, the sizable
decline in investment and growth in China—together
with the generalized slowdown across emerging market
economies—implies a sizable weakening of commodity
prices, particularly those for metals, resulting in a weakening of the terms of trade for commodity exporters.
Investment growth in emerging market economies
is assumed to decline annually by about 4 percentage
points on average relative to the baseline in both simulations. The decline varies within regions: countries
with weaker baseline medium-term growth projections
see a smaller decline. This reflects the assumption of a
broader slowing in economic convergence in the current global environment.
The lower investment growth and the resulting
weaker domestic demand conditions reduce potential
output in emerging market economies. The negative impact operates not only through the relatively
lower growth in the capital stock, but also through
a reduction in total factor productivity growth. The
latter reflects the assumption of new technology being
embodied in new capital. Lower investment growth
therefore results in a lower rate of technological progress, with the decline assumed to be proportional to
the slowing in investment growth. In addition, weaker
domestic demand leads to higher unemployment,
which, in turn, results in a reduction in labor supply.
Skill depreciation among the unemployed leads to a
higher natural rate of unemployment, and discouraged
workers withdraw from the labor force.
The first simulation focuses on the real side of the
shock, while in the second simulation, the stronger
slowing in potential output also leads to increased risk
aversion toward emerging market assets. The reason
is that investors worry about return prospects on
assets and default risks on loans made before expected
growth fell. As a result, risk premiums on assets issued
by entities in these economies increase at the outset
by 100 basis points, and their currencies depreciate by

10 percent relative to the dollar. The increase in risk
aversion and premiums is akin to the decompression
of risk premiums in the global asset market disruption
scenario in the October 2015 Global Financial Stability
Report, except that in the risk scenario examined in
this box, it is confined to emerging market economies
where the shock originates.
In the first simulation (red lines in Scenario Figure 1), growth in 2016 would be about 0.4 percentage
point below the WEO baseline (blue lines in the figure). Economic growth in the major emerging market
economies (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa)
would gradually decline by 1 percentage point relative
to 2015. Compared with the baseline, this would
amount to a sizable growth differential of 2 percentage points after five years. In other emerging market
economies, growth would remain broadly unchanged
relative to 2015, rather than increasing by about 1 percentage point under the baseline.
The growth rebound in advanced economies in 2016
would be smaller. Lower global interest rates and a more
modest recovery in oil prices would boost domestic
demand in these economies relative to the baseline.
Lower interest rates would reflect both weaker global
activity and the monetary policy response across the
globe. But the positive domestic demand impact from
lower interest rates and oil prices in advanced economies would be more than offset by the effects of weaker
external demand. In fact, the scenario suggests substantial demand rebalancing. Currencies of emerging market
economies would depreciate in real effective terms,
and these economies’ current accounts would improve
with the positive impact on net exports. Conversely,
advanced economies would see real appreciation and a
deterioration in current accounts. Overall, the spillovers
to advanced economies from the structural slowdown in
emerging market economies would be negative.
In a second simulation, in which lower growth prospects in emerging market economies also heighten risk
aversion, growth in emerging market economies would
decline by more (yellow lines in the figure). While the
depreciations and initial tightening in financial conditions would gradually dissipate, there would be some
persistent tightening in financial conditions broadly
proportional to emerging market economies’ growth
slowdowns, highlighting the amplifying role of financial
channels in the transmission of the shock. There would
be no pickup in global growth in 2016, and average
growth would be lower across all country groups over

the next five years. The decline in growth in emerging market economies would be partly cushioned by
stronger net exports, and their current account balances
would improve substantially, reflecting the weakness in

26

domestic demand as well as the real depreciation. On
the other hand, advanced economies would see a sizable
deterioration in current account balances, given weaker
external demand and stronger currencies.

CHAPTER 1

as large-scale asset purchases, but also negative policy
rates where effective). It is important, however, that
the overall policy mix be supportive. Monetary policy
efforts should be accompanied by efforts to strengthen
balance sheets and the credit supply channel, and by
the active use of macroprudential policies to address
financial stability risks. Complementary fiscal policy
action in countries with fiscal space is also important,
supporting global rebalancing, and demand-­supporting
structural reforms are necessary, in particular to
improve productivity and stimulate investment. Managing high public debt in a low-growth and low-inflation environment also remains a key challenge in many
advanced economies. Nominal income growth contributes little to reducing debt ratios in this environment,
and fiscal consolidation would be the main means for
achieving more sustainable public debt levels. But if
the pace of consolidation is not attuned to the strength
of the economic conditions, it risks lowering growth
and putting downward pressure on prices, thereby
offsetting the direct positive effect of consolidation on
debt ratios.
Within these broad contours, challenges differ considerably across countries.
In the euro area, the pickup in activity is welcome,
but the recovery remains modest and uneven. Output
gaps are still sizable, and projections suggest that euroarea-wide inflation will remain below target into the
medium term. Hence, ensuring a stronger euro-areawide recovery must remain a priority, helping global
rebalancing and with positive spillovers through trade
and financial channels.
•• On the monetary policy front, the European Central
Bank’s expanded asset purchase program has boosted
confidence and eased financial conditions. These
monetary policy efforts must continue and should
be supported by measures to strengthen bank balance sheets, which would help improve monetary
policy transmission and credit market conditions.
Stricter supervision of nonperforming loans and
measures to improve insolvency and foreclosure
procedures are a priority in this regard.
•• On the fiscal policy front, countries should adhere
to their commitments under the Stability and
Growth Pact. Nevertheless, countries with fiscal
space, notably Germany and the Netherlands, could
do more to encourage growth, especially by undertaking much-needed infrastructure investment and
supporting structural reforms. Countries without
fiscal space should continue to reduce debt and meet

Recent Developments and Prospects

their fiscal targets. In general, all countries should
pursue growth-friendly fiscal rebalancing that lowers
marginal taxes on labor and capital, financed by cuts
to unproductive spending or measures to broaden
the tax base. Swift implementation of investments
related to the European Fund for Strategic Investments could help support the recovery, particularly
in countries with limited fiscal space.
In Japan, near-term prospects for economic activity
have weakened, while medium-term inflation expectations are stuck substantially below the 2 percent inflation target. At the same time, potential output growth
remains low.
•• On the monetary policy front, the Bank of Japan
should stand ready for further easing, preferably by
extending purchases under its quantitative and qualitative monetary easing program to longer-maturity
assets. It should also consider providing stronger
guidance to markets by moving to more forecastoriented monetary policy communication. This
would increase the transparency of its assessment
of inflation prospects and signal its commitment to
the country’s inflation target, mainly through the
discussion of envisaged policy changes if inflation is
not on track.
•• On the fiscal front, the announced medium-term
fiscal consolidation plan provides a useful anchor
to guide fiscal policy. Japan should aim to put debt
on a downward path, based on realistic economic
assumptions, and specific structural revenue and
expenditure measures should be identified up front.
In the United States, conditions for further job
creation and improvement in labor market conditions
remain in place, notwithstanding lower productivity
growth and the less favorable prospects for exports in
light of the sharp dollar appreciation.
•• On the monetary policy front, the main near-term
policy issue is the appropriate timing and pace of
monetary policy normalization. The Federal Open
Market Committee’s decisions should remain data
dependent, with the first increase in the federal
funds rate waiting until there are firmer signs of
inflation rising steadily toward the Federal Reserve’s
2 percent medium-term inflation objective, with
continued strength in the labor market. At present a
broad range of indicators suggest a notable improvement in the labor market, but there is little evidence
of accelerating wage and price pressures. Regardless of the timing of the initial policy move, the
data would suggest that the pace of subsequent rate

27

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: ADJUSTING TO LOWER COMMODITY PRICES

increases should be gradual. An effective monetary
policy communication strategy will remain essential,
particularly in an environment of higher financial
market volatility in which spillovers through financial channels could be material.
•• On the fiscal policy front, the priority remains to
agree on a medium-term fiscal consolidation plan
to prepare for rising aging-related fiscal costs, while
avoiding disruptive changes to the fiscal stance in
the short term because of political gridlock. A credible medium-term fiscal plan will need to include
higher tax revenue.
Structural Reforms
Potential output growth in advanced economies
is expected to remain weak compared with precrisis
standards. The main reasons for the subdued forecast
are population aging, which underlies the projected
low growth and possible decline in trend employment
under current policies affecting labor force participation, and weak productivity growth. A first priority for
structural policies therefore is to strengthen both labor
force participation and trend employment.
•• In Japan, removing tax disincentives and raising the
availability of child care facilities through deregulation would help to boost female labor force participation further. Increasing reliance on foreign labor
and providing incentives for older workers to remain
in the workforce should also help in avoiding
declines in trend employment.
•• In the euro area, where structural, long-term, and
youth unemployment are high in many economies,
an important concern is skill erosion and its effect on
trend employment. In addition to macroeconomic
policies to boost demand, priorities include lower
disincentives to employment—among them lowering
the labor tax wedge—as well as better-targeted training programs and active labor market policies.
•• In the United States, expanding the earned income
tax credit, better family benefits (including child
care assistance), and immigration reform would help
boost labor supply.
Increasing productivity growth through structural
policies is challenging. But a number of high-priority
structural measures would likely boost productivity
through their direct or indirect effects on investment
(as new technology is embodied in new capital) and
through the effects of labor market reforms on incentives for learning and human capital development.

28

International Monetary Fund | October 2015

•• In a number of advanced economies (including
several countries in the euro area as well as the
United States), there is a strong case for greater
infrastructure investment. In addition to boosting
medium-term potential output, partly by making
private investment more efficient, such investment
would also provide much-needed short-term support
to domestic demand in some of these economies.
•• In euro area economies, lowering barriers to entry in
product markets and reforming labor market regulations that hamper adjustment are critical. In debtor
economies, these changes would strengthen external
competitiveness and help sustain gains in external
adjustment while economies recover, whereas in
creditor economies, they would primarily strengthen
investment and employment. Further progress
should also be made in implementing the European
Union Services Directive, advancing free-trade agreements, and integrating capital and energy markets,
which could raise productivity. And as mentioned
earlier, reforms tackling legacy debt overhang (for
instance, through resolving nonperforming loans,
facilitating out-of-court settlement, and improving
insolvency frameworks) would help credit demand
and supply recover.
•• In Japan, more forceful structural reforms (the
third arrow of Abenomics) should be the priority.
Measures to increase labor force participation are
essential, as previously discussed, but there is also
scope for raising productivity in the services sector
through deregulation, invigorating labor productivity by reducing labor market duality, and supporting
investment through corporate governance reform as
well as improvements to the provision of risk capital
by the financial system.

Policies to Foster Growth and Manage Vulnerabilities in
Emerging Market and Developing Economies
Policymakers in emerging market economies face the
challenge of dealing with slowing growth, more difficult
external conditions, and increased vulnerabilities after
a decade or so of buoyant growth. While the resilience
to external shocks has increased in many emerging
market economies because of increased exchange rate
flexibility, higher foreign exchange reserves, more robust
external financing patterns, and generally stronger policy
frameworks, there are a number of important policy
challenges and trade-offs to consider.

CHAPTER 1

•• The extent of economic slack might be small despite
the growth slowdown. An important consideration
for the calibration of macroeconomic policies is
the degree of economic slack. The latter might
be smaller than the sizable growth slowdown
since 2011 in many emerging market economies
might suggest. The reason is that the growth slowdown partly reflects a cyclical return to potential
output after overheating in broad credit and investment booms, driven by factors such as increasing
commodity prices and easing financial conditions
for emerging market economies.11 In addition,
as discussed in Chapter 2, in countries where the
growth slowdown has been partly driven by lower
commodity prices, potential output growth is likely
to have declined as well and might decrease further,
given the weaker commodity price outlook. The
evidence of slowing productivity growth in major
emerging market economies in recent years adds to
these concerns.12
•• Monetary conditions have eased with exchange rate
depreciation, but vulnerabilities might limit the scope
for monetary easing. Amid greater exchange rate flexibility, substantial currency depreciation in real effective terms in many emerging market economies has
contributed to easier monetary conditions. Whether
economic conditions also call for monetary policy
easing raises difficult trade-offs. Real policy rates are
already below natural rates in many economies, and
lowering rates could trigger sizable further depreciation. This could increase financial stability risks,
given higher corporate leverage and balance sheet
exposure to foreign-currency risks in many emerging
market economies (as analyzed in Chapter 3 of the
October 2015 GFSR). Moreover, if monetary policy
frameworks lack credibility or policy credibility
is strained, the concern is that depreciation could
also lead to persistently higher prices and pressure
for further exchange rate depreciation, a particular
worry when inflation is already above target.
•• The likelihood of further currency depreciation in
emerging market economies may require stronger
regulatory and macroprudential frameworks. Emerging market and developing economies not relying
on exchange rate pegs have to be ready to allow the
exchange rate to respond to adverse external shocks.
11See
12See

Box 1.2 of the October 2013 WEO.
Chapter 3 of the April 2015 WEO.

Recent Developments and Prospects

In some countries, this may require strengthening
the credibility of monetary and fiscal policy frameworks, while balance sheet exposures to foreign
exchange risks need to remain manageable. The
latter calls for enforcing or (if needed) strengthening prudential regulation and supervision as well as
adequate macroprudential frameworks.
•• Increased vulnerabilities might also introduce fiscal policy trade-offs. Public debt ratios are relatively low in
a number of emerging market economies, although
budget deficits generally remain above precrisis
ratios despite the strong recovery after the global
financial crisis. Fiscal easing could support demand
when output gaps are large and monetary policy is
constrained, but it would also increase vulnerabilities in the current context, mostly because of risks of
higher country risk premiums in the broader context
of capital flow reversal risks. In economies with
preexisting fiscal vulnerabilities, the fiscal space is
thus likely to be limited. In addition, in economies
with downward revisions to medium-term growth
prospects, fiscal policy might have to adjust to lower
fiscal revenue at full employment, a first-order issue
notably in commodity exporters, given commodity
price declines.
Beyond the common context, policy considerations
for net commodity exporters generally differ from those
for net commodity importers.
•• In many net commodity importers, lower commodity prices have alleviated inflation pressure and
reduced external vulnerabilities with the terms-oftrade windfall gains. The trade-off between supporting demand if there is economic slack and
reducing macroeconomic vulnerabilities has become
less pronounced as a result. In some importers with
commodity-related subsidies, the windfall gains
from lower oil prices have been used to increase
public sector savings and strengthen fiscal positions.
Whether the improved fiscal policy space should be
used depends on the extent of economic slack, the
strength of the economy’s fiscal position, and the
need for structural reforms or growth-enhancing
spending (on, for example, infrastructure).
•• In commodity exporters, fiscal positions have deteriorated and external and fiscal vulnerabilities have
increased. The urgency to adjust policies varies considerably, depending on fiscal buffers. Exporters with
buffers can afford to adjust government spending
gradually to avoid exacerbating the slowdown. Nev-

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: ADJUSTING TO LOWER COMMODITY PRICES

ertheless, with some of the commodity price decline
expected to be permanent, it will be important to
assess the revenue implications and plan for fiscal
adjustment. In exporters with limited policy space,
allowing substantial exchange rate depreciation will
be the main avenue available to cushion the impact
of the commodity price shock on their economies.
As discussed in the October 2015 Fiscal Monitor,
the weaker commodity price outlook also highlights
that in some commodity exporters, fiscal policy
frameworks might need to be upgraded to factor in
commodity-market-related uncertainty and to provide
a longer-term anchor to guide policy decisions.
Turning to policy requirements in large emerging
market economies, policymakers in China face the
challenge of simultaneously achieving three objectives:
avoiding a sharp growth slowdown in the transition to more sustainable patterns of growth, reducing vulnerabilities from excess leverage after a credit
and investment boom, and strengthening the role of
market forces in the economy. Modest further policy
support to ensure that growth does not fall sharply
is likely to be needed, but further progress in implementing the authorities’ structural reforms will be
critical for private consumption to pick up some of
the slack from slowing investment growth. The core
of the reforms is to give market mechanisms a more
decisive role in the economy, eliminate distortions,
and strengthen institutions. Examples include financial
sector reforms to strengthen regulation and supervision, liberalize deposit rates, increase the reliance on
interest rates as an instrument of monetary policy, and
eliminate widespread implicit guarantees; fiscal and
social security reforms; and reforms of state-owned
enterprises, including leveling the playing field between
the public and private sectors. The recent change in
China’s exchange rate system provides the basis for
a more market-determined exchange rate, but much
depends on implementation. A floating exchange rate
will enhance monetary policy autonomy and help the
economy adjust to external shocks, as China continues to become more integrated into both the global
economy and global financial markets.
In India, near-term growth prospects remain favorable, and the decrease in the current account deficit
has lowered external vulnerabilities. The faster-thanexpected decline in inflation has created space for
considering modest cuts in the nominal policy rate,
but the real policy rate needs to remain tight for infla-

30

International Monetary Fund | October 2015

tion to decline to the inflation target in the medium
term, given upside risks to inflation. Continued fiscal
consolidation is also essential, but it should be more
growth friendly (tax reform, reduction in subsidies).
With balance sheet strains in the corporate and
banking sectors, financial sector regulation should be
enhanced, provisioning increased, and debt recovery
strengthened. Structural reforms should focus on relaxing long-standing supply constraints in the energy,
mining, and power sectors. Priorities include marketbased pricing of natural resources to boost investment,
addressing delays in the implementation of infrastructure projects, and improving policy frameworks in the
power and mining sectors.
Several years of downgraded medium-term growth
prospects suggest that it is also time for major emerging market economies to turn to important structural
reforms to raise productivity and growth in a lasting
way. Although the slowing in estimated total factor productivity growth in major emerging market economies
is partly a natural implication of recent progress in convergence, as discussed in Chapter 3 of the April 2015
WEO, the concern is that potential output growth has
become too dependent on factor accumulation in some
economies. The structural reform agenda naturally differs across countries, but it includes removing infrastructure bottlenecks in the power sector (India, Indonesia,
South Africa); easing limits on trade and investment and
improving business conditions (Brazil, Indonesia, Russia); and implementing reforms to education, labor, and
product markets to raise competitiveness and productivity (Brazil, China, India, South Africa) and government
services delivery (South Africa).

Policies in Low-Income Countries
Growth in low-income countries as a group
has stayed high while growth in emerging market
economies has weakened. But with weak activity in
advanced economies, a slowdown in emerging market
economies, and lower commodity prices, low-income
countries’ growth prospects for 2015 and beyond have
been revised downward. In addition, greater access to
foreign-market financing has increased some lowincome countries’ exposure to a possible tightening in
global financial conditions.
Policies must respond to the increased challenges
and vulnerabilities. In some countries, fiscal positions must be improved against the backdrop of lower

CHAPTER 1

commodity and other export-related revenue and the
possibility of some future growth moderation. Specific
requirements vary from country to country, but general priorities include broadening the revenue base and
adjusting nonessential expenditure while maintaining
essential capital expenditure to address infrastructure
gaps and social spending.
In many low-income countries, allowing for
exchange rate flexibility will help the adjustment to
less favorable external demand and financial conditions. But such flexibility may require steps to tighten
the macroeconomic policy stance and to strengthen
the monetary policy framework to limit damaging
second-round effects on domestic prices. And for commodity exporters, especially those with limited buffers,
fiscal consolidation will be needed to adjust to lower
commodity revenue. Commodity exporters also need a
longer-term anchor for fiscal policy, given commodityprice-related uncertainty. The anchor should provide
for sufficient longer-term fiscal buffers to deal with
large and persistent shocks, and, where relevant,
resource depletion. It will also be critical for commodity exporters to manage foreign-currency exposures in
balance sheets carefully.
Low-income countries also need to make progress
in meeting the Sustainable Development Goals, which
replaced the Millennium Development Goals in September. Progress in attaining the Millennium Development Goals was uneven, and the global financial
crisis set back the hard-won gains in many cases. The
poorest states, fragile states, and conflict-affected states
continue to face severe challenges in meeting their
development priorities.
Measures to address the growth challenges and
vulnerabilities discussed earlier will be important
for progress on these development goals. Policies
to foster sustainable resource mobilization to boost
growth and promote economic diversification will
also be important. Priorities vary across countries, but
broadly include measures to strengthen fiscal revenue,

Recent Developments and Prospects

promote financial deepening, and attract foreign
capital flows. The international community, including
advanced and systemically important emerging market economies, will also need to play an important
supportive role in maintaining an enabling external
environment. Priorities include further trade liberalization, providing development aid and technical
assistance, completing the global regulatory reform
agenda, and cooperating on international taxation
and climate change issues.

2Percent of GDP.
3Percent. National definitions of unemployment may differ.
4Includes Guyana and Suriname. See note 6 regarding consumer prices.
5The data for Argentina are officially reported data as revised in May 2014. On February 1, 2013, the IMF issued a declaration of censure, and in December 2013 called on Argentina to
implement specified actions to address the quality of its official GDP data according to a specified timetable. On June 3, 2015, the Executive Board recognized the ongoing discussions with
the Argentine authorities and their material progress in remedying the inaccurate provision of data since 2013, but found that some specified actions called for by the end of February 2015
had not yet been completely implemented. The Executive Board will review this issue again by July 15, 2016, and in line with the procedures set forth in the IMF legal framework.
6Consumer price data from December 2013 onward reflect the new national CPI (IPCNu), which differs substantively from the preceding CPI (the CPI for the Greater Buenos Aires Area,
CPI-GBA). Because of the differences in geographical coverage, weights, sampling, and methodology, the IPCNu data cannot be directly compared to the earlier CPI-GBA data. Because of
this structural break in the data, the average CPI inflation for 2014 is not reported in the October 2015 World Economic Outlook. Following a declaration of censure by the IMF on February
1, 2013, the public release of a new national CPI by the end of March 2014 was one of the specified actions in the IMF Executive Board’s December 2013 decision calling on Argentina to
address the quality of its official CPI data. On June 3, 2015, the Executive Board recognized the ongoing discussions with the Argentine authorities and their material progress in remedying
the inaccurate provision of data since 2013, but found that some specified actions called for by the end of February 2015 had not yet been completely implemented. The Executive Board
will review this issue again by July 15, 2016, and in line with the procedures set forth in the IMF legal framework.
7Central America comprises Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama.
8The Caribbean comprises Antigua and Barbuda, The Bahamas, Barbados, Dominica, the Dominican Republic, Grenada, Haiti, Jamaica, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the
Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago.
9Latin America and the Caribbean comprises Mexico and economies from the Caribbean, Central America, and South America. See note 6 regarding consumer prices.
10Eastern Caribbean Currency Union comprises Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines as well as Anguilla and Montserrat, which are not IMF members.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: ADJUSTING TO LOWER COMMODITY PRICES

Special Feature: Commodity Market Developments and
Forecasts, with a Focus on Metals in the World Economy
After experiencing large swings, commodity prices have
declined significantly since the release of the April 2015
World Economic Outlook (WEO). Following an initial
recovery, oil prices have since declined on account of
strong supply and concerns about future demand. Metal
prices have fallen owing to slowing demand growth
from China and substantial increases in the supply of
most metals. Food prices have also declined owing to
abundant harvests this year. With concerns over China’s
growth, risks to oil and metal prices are on the downside.
Weather-related risks to food supplies have heightened.
This special feature includes an in-depth analysis of metal
markets in the world economy. It puts recent developments into perspective by documenting the dramatic
demand and supply shifts over past decades and argues
that the balance between demand and supply forces
points to a “low-for-long” scenario in metal prices.
Commodity prices have declined 14 percent since
February 2015, the reference period for the April
WEO (Figure 1.SF.1, panel 1). Oil prices had initially
recovered in response to a sharp drop in investment in
the sector, but have since declined again on account
of strong supply from members of the Organization
of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and
the Islamic Republic of Iran nuclear deal. Natural gas
and coal prices, which are mainly indexed to oil prices,
albeit with a lag, have also declined. Nonfuel commodity prices have also weakened, with metal prices and
those of agricultural commodities declining by 13 and
8 percent, respectively.
Global excess flow supply in oil (the difference
between global production and global consumption)
has continued to increase in 2015 on account of strong
supply, in spite of the dramatic fall in investment in
the oil sector. In the United States, the number of
oil rigs—apparatuses for on-land oil drilling—is half
what it was at its peak in October 2014 (Figure 1.SF.1,
panel 2). In OPEC countries, production has been
increasing despite low oil prices, exceeding OPEC’s
target of 30 million barrels a day (mbd) by more than
1.5 mbd in August. Russia has also been producing at

record levels. In addition, the United Nations Security
Council has adopted a resolution establishing a monitoring mechanism for the Iranian nuclear program,
paving the way for eventual removal of all nuclearrelated sanctions against the country. Iranian crude oil
exports are thus expected to increase, and the country
is believed to have 30 million barrels of oil inventory.
Without sanctions, the Islamic Republic of Iran is also
expected to increase its capacity to 500,000 to 800,000
barrels a day within two years. Most of the future
increase in Iranian oil supply has been priced in spot
markets, contributing to a flattening of futures curves.
While actual global oil demand is strong, there are
concerns about what the future will bring. Global oil
demand in 2015 is expected to grow at 1.7 mbd above
trend growth, the fastest rate in five years, according
to the International Energy Agency. It has been revised
upward by 0.9 mbd relative to the March projection.
However, the recent volatility in stock markets worldwide has triggered concerns about future global economic growth that may eventually affect demand for
oil. The loss in confidence in global financial markets
added downward pressure on oil prices in August.
Oil futures contracts point to rising prices (Figure
1.SF.1, panel 3). The baseline assumptions for the
IMF’s average petroleum spot price, which is based on
futures prices, suggest average annual prices of $51.62
a barrel in 2015, $50.36 in 2016, and $55.42 in 2017
(Figure 1.SF.1, panel 4). There is still substantial uncertainty around the baseline assumptions for oil prices,
but it is slightly less than at the time of the April 2015
WEO.
Metal prices have declined 13 percent since February 2015 (Figure 1.SF.1, panel 5). Prices had initially
rebounded as a result of supply concerns but have
faced downward pressure since mid-May. China’s currency decline and stock market correction have raised
concern over the strength of metal demand. China represents roughly half of global demand for major base
metals and has been the main engine of global growth
since 2002 (see “Metals in the World Economy”).
Metal prices are projected to decline by 22 percent in
2015 and 9 percent in 2016. Futures prices point to
continued low prices but with rising uncertainty on
account of both demand (especially from China) and
stronger supply.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: ADJUSTING TO LOWER COMMODITY PRICES

Annual food prices are projected to decline by 17
percent in 2015 as supply growth, together with high
levels of stocks, outpaces slower demand increases. Large
declines are expected in prices for cereals and vegetable
oil, particularly those for wheat and soybeans. For 2016
the expected drop is relatively smaller (5 percent), following marginal declines in projected production for
major crops (Figure 1.SF.1, panel 6). Food price risks are
associated with the usual weather variability, particularly
concerns over El Niño conditions, which are expected
to strengthen through the Northern Hemisphere and
persist into the first quarter of 2016.

Metals in the World Economy
Although the recent fall has captured the public’s
attention, metal prices have been declining since
2011. Some analysts have argued that we are at a
critical juncture, pointing to the end of the so-called
commodities supercycle. While that is hard to assert
with confidence, the prolonged fall in metal prices is
consistent with a typical commodity boom-and-bust
cycle. Indeed, after a period of high metal prices during the 2000s, investment and in turn capacity in the
sector have increased substantially. At the same time,
high prices have led to downward adjustments on the
demand side. Those adjustments have contributed to a
gradual decline in metal prices since 2011, which has
led to less investment in the sector, especially in highcost mines, considering the lower expected profits. The
lower investment will eventually reduce capacity, and
lower production should eventually lead to a rebound
in metal prices. The more prolonged the slump in
metal prices, the sharper the likely eventual reversal.
Understanding the evolution of metal markets is
important for at least two reasons. First, at the global
level, metals are at the heart of the world economy
because they are key intermediate inputs in industrial
production and construction. Metal markets are thus
shaped by shifts in the volume and composition of
global demand and supply. As such, transformations
in metal markets also signal important changes in the
world economy. Second, for some countries, metal
exports are a large portion of their total exports, and
fluctuations in metal prices can have important macroeconomic consequences.1 The remaining subsections of
this Special Feature address the following questions:
1Chapter 2 discusses the macroeconomic consequences resulting
from commodity price fluctuations in depth.

What Are Metals?
Metals are mineral bodies that come in a variety of
forms, from base metals to precious metals. Base metals
are those that oxidize or corrode relatively easily. Within
base metals, a distinction is made between ferrous and
nonferrous metals. Ferrous metals, typically iron, tend
to be heavy and relatively abundant. Nonferrous metals
do not contain iron in significant amounts. Generally more expensive than ferrous metals, nonferrous
metals have desirable properties such as low weight
(for example, aluminum), higher conductivity (for
example, copper), nonmagnetic properties, or resistance
to corrosion (for example, zinc and nickel). The term
“base metals” is commonly used in contrast with “noble
metals,” which unlike most base metals are resistant to
corrosion or oxidation. Noble metals tend to be precious metals, often because of their perceived scarcity.
Examples include gold, platinum, silver, rhodium,
iridium, and palladium. Chemically, precious metals are
less reactive than most elements and have high luster
and high electrical conductivity.
Unless otherwise indicated, this Special Feature
focuses on four main base metals: iron ore, copper,
aluminum, and nickel. All have experienced price
declines, although to a varying extent (Figure 1.SF.2).
The end use of these metals covers a wide spectrum,
but construction and machinery are two key sectors for
their use, given their ductile and malleable properties.

Where Are the Main Centers of Metal Production and
Consumption?
Production and consumption centers for metals
are concentrated in a few countries, but the location
of production centers varies considerably with the
metal under consideration. The main production and
consumption centers, however, often overlap: iron ore,
for example, given its bulk, must be close to markets.
China is front and center for both metal consumption
and metal production, also reflecting its importance
in world industrial production. Selected multinational
or state-owned corporations have large market shares
in the production and refining of some of the main

metals. Those high degrees of concentration have at
times led to concerns over market manipulation and
collusion either through output restrictions, export
bans, stock accumulations, or some combination of
these (see Rausser and Stuermer 2014 for an analysis of
collusion in the copper market).
From an economic point of view, iron ore is by far
the most important base metal, with a $225 billion
annual industry in terms of global sales.2 Steel, which
is produced from iron ore, is mostly used for construction, transportation equipment, and machinery. In the
past, iron ore prices were mostly determined by negotiations between Japanese steel makers and producers.
More recently, the market has become more transparent, with the price on delivery at Chinese ports used
as the benchmark price. The top iron-ore-producing
country is China, whose share is about half of the
world’s production, followed by Australia and Brazil.3
Considering that mining iron ore is capital intensive,
2World production of iron ore is currently 3 billion metric tons;
its metal content weighs about 1.4 billion tons, according to the U.S.
Geological Survey. The price of iron ore with 62 percent iron content
has been roughly $100 a metric ton in the past year.
3China’s share, however, is much smaller when the ore’s metal
content is taken into consideration. Iron ore is also important for
individual countries, such as Ukraine, which relies on coal and iron
ore to produce steel.

iron ore production is concentrated among top producers (Table 1.SF.1, Figure 1.SF.3). The production of
iron ore depends crucially on the level of investment
activity in the sector, which has been on the decline
in the past few years. The demand for iron ore comes
primarily from large steel-producing countries such as
China, which consumes more than half of the world
production of iron ore.
Copper is the second-most-important base metal by
value—accounting for roughly a $130 billion industry
annually.4 Copper is used for construction and electrical wire. Chile is the largest producer, followed by
China and Peru. A few companies are involved in copper production—Chile’s Codelco is the largest. Copper
prices have been more transparent than those for iron
ore because copper futures markets and London Metal
Exchange settlements are used as benchmarks. China
consumes about half of the world’s refined copper.
The third-most-important base metal is aluminum
(with an annual $90 billion industry).5 Aluminum
is used in the aerospace industry as well as other
industries requiring light metal. Large producers of
aluminum are located where electricity is cheap and
abundant. The largest producer is China, followed
by Russia, Canada, and the United Arab Emirates.
Aluminum prices are the most stable among those
for metals because of the reliance on electricity in its
production—electricity prices are heavily regulated in
most countries.

4World mine production was 18.7 million metric tons in 2014.
It is evaluated at $7,000 a metric ton, close to the average price in
2014.
5World primary aluminum production last year was 49.3 million
metric tons, and the associated price was $1,900 a metric ton.

International Monetary Fund | October 2015

Recycling has become an important part of aluminum production because the recycling process is
much less energy intensive than the production of
primary aluminum. China consumes about half of the
world’s production of primary aluminum. In contrast,
advanced economies rely more on recycling and in
turn have less influence over primary aluminum prices.
The fourth-most-important base metal is nickel
(accounting for a $40 billion market),6 which is used
for alloys such as stainless steel. Nickel ore is mined in
several countries, including the Philippines. The Brazilian Vale groups and Russia-based Norilsk are the two
top producers, and their combined share is 23 percent
of global production. Nickel is typically extracted
from its ores by conventional roasting and reduction
processes that yield a metal of greater than 75 percent purity. China consumes about half of the world’s
smelted and refined nickel, followed by Japan. Indonesia, whose production share was 27 percent in 2012,
imposed an export ban on nickel ore in January 2014
to increase incentives for domestic processing. The
Philippines and New Caledonia have used the opportunity created by the ban to increase their market shares,
but may not be in a position to meet the portion of
Chinese demand that relied on Indonesian production.
On the other hand, global inventory of refined nickel
has been increasing, suggesting a supply glut.

How Have Metal Markets Evolved?
Over the past decades, metal markets have undergone dramatic shifts in the volume and structure
of both demand and supply. Global production has
increased across the board for most metals owing to
the rapid investment in capacity in the 2000s (Figure
1.SF.4, panel 1). On the demand side, demand has
shifted from West to East; that is, from consumption concentrated in advanced economies toward that
concentrated in emerging markets—especially China
on account of its rapid growth (Figure 1.SF.4, panel 2).
On the supply side, the so-called frontier of extraction of nonferrous metals, including precious metals
such as gold, has shifted from North to South—that
is, from advanced to developing economies—because
of the rapid improvement in the investment climate,
first in Latin America and then in sub-Saharan Africa
(see Box 1.SF.1). While high-income member coun6Nickel

mine production was 2.4 million tons in 2014, and the
price of refined nickel was roughly $17,000 a metric ton.

Note: The ﬁgures reported for iron ore production in China are in crude terms,

be interpreted with caution. The production ﬁgures for iron ore are thus not
consistent with those for consumption, because the latter are based on
effectively usable iron ore.

tries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development accounted for close to half of global
discoveries of major mines between 1950 and 1990,
sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean have doubled their shares in total discoveries
since 1990, which are about half what they were in the
preceding period. The pattern of global trade in metals
has radically changed as a result of those shifts in the
loci of major discoveries. It should be noted that for
steel and aluminum, production tends to be located in
countries with combined deposits of iron ore or bauxite—which are abundant worldwide—and port facilities, easy access to energy, and proximity to markets.
On the demand side, the most dramatic development
explaining the shift from West to East is the formidable growth performance of China. China’s growth in
consumption of metals has been the main driving force
behind global metal consumption since the early 2000s
(Figure 1.SF.5, panels 1 and 2). As a result China is
now the main consumption locus for most metals. Far

their metal consumption, while consumption in Japan

other commodity prices (see Gauvin and Rebillard 2015

major metal companies producing iron ore suggest that
the rapid increase in investment during the period of
high metal prices in the early 2000s has been followed
by a gradual decline since 2011, closely following the
trajectory of metal prices (Figure 1.SF.5, panel 3). As
mentioned earlier, for ferrous metals, investment is a
good indicator of future supply capacity. For nonferrous metals, the actual quantity available from mineral
deposits is much more relevant for predicting supply. A
unique data set of discoveries is used here to allow an
assessment of the emergence of new frontiers of metal
extraction. That assessment offers evidence that prices
have played little role in driving discoveries of mineral
deposits (see Box 1.SF.1). Instead, rapid improvements
in institutions, including those related to property rights
in Latin America and Africa, have led to a gradual
increase in the number of major discoveries of metals in
those regions since the 1990s. The results have important implications both for the welfare of individual
countries and for our global understanding of the balance of forces shaping metal markets and the pattern of
global trade in metals.
The pattern of global metal trade has evolved
dramatically over the past decades,7 with the major
destination countries shifting from West to East and
the source countries from North to South. In 2002,
metals were exported mainly from Canada and Russia
to the United States or from Australia to Japan, Korea,

tin, uranium, and zinc.

and China. In contrast, by 2014 almost half of metal
exports were going from Australia, Brazil, and Chile to
China. China has become the largest importer of metals, with its share increasing from less than 10 percent
to 46 percent from 2002 to 2014 (Table 1.SF.2).
Many developing economies depend heavily on metal
exports. These exports have risen sharply as a percentage
of GDP, and the group of largest metal exporters (as a
percentage of GDP) has changed substantially as a result
(Table 1.SF.3). Metal exports from Chile, Mauritania,
and Niger now account for more than half of these
countries’ total exports of goods. These countries are
thus vulnerable to fluctuations in metal prices such as
those that have recently occurred as a result of shifts in
demand from large importers such as China. Discoveries of new metal deposits have expanded the list of
resource-dependent countries that face new challenges in
terms of macroeconomic management.
China’s recent attempts to rebalance its economy
away from investment toward domestic consumption
are leading not only to lower Chinese demand for metals, but also to a compositional shift in that demand,
which may have different implications for different
metals. Metals are heavily used in machinery, construction, transportation equipment, and manufacturing
industries, while oil is used mainly in transportation.
Thus the decline in growth of manufacturing, machinery, and construction has led to slowing demand for
metal since 2010 (Figure 1.SF.6). The metal price index
has decreased correspondingly. The potential future rise
in the share of the service sector should lead to lower

consumption of metals. Notwithstanding the dramatic
increase in Chinese imports of metals, these represent
less than 2 percent of China’s GDP (Figure 1.SF.7).

What Lies Ahead?
The slower pace of investment in China, that country’s sharp stock market decline since June, and the
ample supply of metals have been exerting downward
pressure on metal prices. Considering that the decline
in metal prices started much earlier, it makes sense to
ask what should be expected. As mentioned earlier,
futures markets point to lower prices, though the
decline is projected to bottom out. But it is helpful in
this regard to go beyond futures and review the forces
underpinning demand and supply of metals.
On the demand side, the Chinese economy is
projected to slow further, albeit gradually, but with
considerable uncertainty as to both the time frame for
the slowdown and the full extent of the slowing. A basic
econometric exercise using historical data and relating the IMF’s metal price index to China’s industrial
production (with both variables expressed as logarithms)
shows that the fall in prices can be explained quite well
by the decline in industrial production (Figure 1.SF.8),
with 60 percent of the variance in metal prices explained
by fluctuations in China’s industrial production. In
addition, this simple regression suggests that the fall in
China’s industrial production in recent months could

Note: The growth rates of total demand for metals are calculated as the sum of
output growth rates for each sector, weighted by the shares of metal input in
the individual sector in the total economy. The share of metal input for each
sector is calculated based on the World Input-Output Database. For the
calculation, the value of the share of metal input in the most recent year is
chosen, that is, 2011, considering that the share of metal input has been quite
stable over the years. Given that the output data for China are not available at the
sector level, proﬁt data by sector are used as a proxy for most of the industries,

produce further metal price declines, as evidenced by the
decoupling between the fitted and actual growth rates in
the metal price index.
On the supply side, the drop in investment is
unlikely to lead to a substantial price rebound in the
near future. Low energy prices have in fact helped
reduce mining and refining costs, including those for
copper, steel, and aluminum. High-cost mines will
certainly close down first, considering that current
metal prices may be close to these mines’ break-even
point. However, a recent analysis of the cost-price
relationship released by consulting firm SNL Metals
& Mining concludes that during cyclical low points in
metal prices, the copper price has fallen to at least the
ninth decile of high-cost producers, which indicates
that prices would need to fall further before substantial

capacity becomes vulnerable to closure.8 Moreover, the
secular expansion of the frontier of metal extraction to
Latin America and Africa as a result of improvements
in the investment climate is unlikely to revert to any
great extent. Instead, those improvements should continue steadily. Thus ample supply is likely to continue
pushing metal prices farther down.

of the metal price index on the annual growth rate of China's industrial production.

The balance between weaker demand and a steady
increase in supply suggests that given the existing cost
structure, metal markets are likely to experience a continued glut, leading to a low-for-long price scenario. In
turn, the risks associated with such a scenario are that
investment will continue to falter and lead to a sharp
increase in prices down the road.

COMMODITY MARKET DEVELOPMENTS AND FORECASTS, WITH A FOCUS ON METALS IN THE WORLD ECONOMY

Box 1.SF.1. The New Frontiers of Metal Extraction: The North-to-South Shift
Fundamental factors underpinning the demand for
primary commodities, including metals, have received
much attention, but supply-side factors have not. As
noted in the Special Feature text, the center of gravity
of global demand has shifted from West to East as a
result of the high growth in emerging markets—especially China—in the past two decades. This box argues
that developments in the supply of metals have been
perhaps just as dramatic. The box focuses on discoveries
of major metal deposits that signal previously unknown
possibilities to expand global supply.1 The main finding
is that the new frontiers of metal exploitation have
shifted from North to South, that is, from advanced to
emerging market and developing economies.

Metal Discoveries through Space and Time
A critical look at the data on known reserves of
subsoil assets suggests that emerging market and developing economies have substantial deposits of metals
that have yet to be discovered. There is an estimated
$130,000 in known subsoil assets beneath the average
square kilometer of Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, which
contrasts with only about $25,000 in Africa (see Collier 2010 and McKinsey Global Institute 2013). It is
unlikely that those differences represent differences in
geological formations between advanced and developing economies. Rather, differences in the quality of
property rights and political stability can help explain
why relatively less exploration effort has been devoted
to emerging market and developing economies.
Improvements in the institutional environments of
these economies accelerated rapidly in the 1990s, however, and a cursory look at the data on political risk
seems to indicate that the timing of the improvements
coincides with the increase in the share of discoveries
in Latin America and Africa (Figure 1.SF.1.1).
Data on discoveries of a wide range of metal deposits
obtained from the consulting firm MinEx suggest that the
frontier of metal exploitation has gradually moved from
The authors of this box are Rabah Arezki and Frederik
Toscani.
1The data used in this box are from MinEx Consulting. The
list of metals used in the analysis is comprehensive and includes
precious metals and rare earth. The data set excludes iron ore and
bauxite, which tend to be relatively more abundant than other
metals and require for their exploitation proximity to port facilities in the case of the former and substantial energy availability
for the latter.

advanced to emerging market and developing economies (Figure 1.SF.1.2). The total number of discoveries has remained broadly constant, but the distribution
has changed. Although high-income OECD countries
accounted for 37 to 50 percent of all discoveries during
1950–89, this share fell to 26 percent in the first decade of
this century, with sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America
and the Caribbean doubling their shares. Latin America
has experienced the most discoveries of metal deposits in
the past two decades.

What Do the Data Show about the Drivers of
Discoveries?
Investments in exploration and extraction activities
involve sunk costs and are thus subject to the holdup problem.2 For an investment to be expected to be profitable, a
stable political environment, a low risk of expropriation,

and a favorable investment climate are crucial (Acemoglu,
Johnson, and Robinson 2001; Bohn and Deacon 2000).
Cust and Harding (2014) provide evidence that institutions substantially affect oil and gas exploration.3 Mining
could be seen as more expropriable than oil extraction
because mining output does not move through pipelines
and takes place exclusively on land.
The approach in this box is to estimate, using a panel
data set, a zero-inflated Poisson model with the number
of mine discoveries by country, year, and metal as the
dependent variable.4 Nitm denotes the number of mines
Arezki, van der Ploeg, and Toscani (forthcoming) present extensive technical details and an in-depth discussion of endogeneity.

variations in institutions and oil deposits sitting on both sides of
a border.
4Large numbers of zeros and the heteroscedasticity of errors
may imply that ordinary least-squares results will be biased and
inconsistent. Silva and Tenreyro (2006) suggest the Poisson
pseudo–maximum likelihood estimator to address this issue.
This box follows this suggestion and uses zero-inflated Poisson

discovered in country i at time t and for a specific metal
m. Nitm is assumed to follow a Poisson distribution.
The main explanatory variable of interest is a country’s political risk rating, obtained from the International
Country Risk Guide’s (ICRG’s) Political Risk Index. The
regressions include metal fixed effects because metals differ in their abundance and location. They also
include country fixed effects to capture time-invariant
country characteristics that are hard to observe, such
as actual geology, and year fixed effects to control for
technology and other global shocks. In addition, price
changes for the corresponding metals over the past five
years are controlled for. The baseline specification uses
the standard log-linear approach to model the expected
number of mine discoveries for metal m in country i at
time t in the three-way Poisson regression model:
ln E(Nitm ) = a + bD pt–1,m + gICRGit–1 + dXitm,
models. The count data are modeled as a Poisson count model,
and a logit model is used to predict zeros.

in which the vector a includes country, time, and
metal fixed effects. The key controls of interest are the
natural logarithm of the world market price for metal
m and the measure of political risk ICRG. The vector
X includes other controls. It should be noted that the
quality of institutions may be endogenous to metal
discoveries in that these discoveries may, for instance,
trigger conflicts over resources and erode institutions (Ross 2001, 2012). Any such endogeneity will,
however, tend to bias the coefficient associated with
institutions toward zero, and as such, that coefficient
should be interpreted as presenting a lower bound. To
alleviate issues of reverse causality somewhat, the political risk rating is included with a one-year lag. In addition, lagged discoveries are controlled for, to account
for the clustering of discoveries. The interactions
between ICRG and metal price and between price and
fixed effects are also explored. Other robustness checks
consist of adding controls such as GDP per capita and
the initial capital stock and using price levels instead
of changes. The main results remain unchanged.
The political risk rating, reflecting property rights
and political stability, is found to be statistically and
economically significant (Table 1.SF.1.1). The results
indicate that a one standard deviation improvement
in the political risk rating (which corresponds to a
move from, for example, Mali to South Africa, South
Africa to Chile, or Chile to Canada) would lead to

1.2 times as many metal discoveries in those countries.
To provide a further sense of the relevant magnitude,
a thought experiment is conducted in which Latin
America’s and sub-Saharan Africa’s median property rights suddenly jump to the levels of the most
advanced economies in each of these regions, which
are, respectively, Chile and Botswana. This experiment yields a 15 percent increase in the number of
mines discovered worldwide, all else equal. The figure
increases to 25 percent if instead Latin America and
sub-Saharan Africa were to suddenly adopt the same
level of property rights as in the United States, again
all else equal. Notwithstanding the dramatic increase
in institutions forced by the thought experiment, the
magnitudes suggest that institutions play an important
role in driving exploration for and ultimately discoveries of metals. Institutions affect discoveries through
a variety of channels besides the perception of risk
on the part of the potential foreign investors. For
instance, better institutions could affect the adoption
of better technology or improve the quality of the
labor force and in turn affect the number of discoveries. The analysis here does not attempt to separate
those channels.
Results also suggest that movements in metal prices
over the past five years are not statistically significant
in explaining the number of discoveries. The likelihood of additional discoveries appears to increase with

Box 1.SF.1 (continued)
previous discoveries, as would be expected given the
reduced risk of exploring close to a known deposit.

What Are the Implications?
The North-South shift in the frontier of metal
exploitation is likely to have important consequences
for individual economies with newly found metal
deposits, especially in Latin America and Africa.
Indeed, these discoveries expand the list of resourcerich countries. New mines mean more investment and
jobs, especially in the resource sector, and increased
government revenues. New trade routes have been

50

International Monetary Fund | October 2015

inaugurated from Latin America and Africa to emerging Asia. However, these newly found resources pose
challenges for the conduct of macroeconomic policy in
developing economies in both the short and the long
term.
While demand for metals emanating from emerging markets has been a key driver of recent global metal
market developments, progress in the quality of institutions has helped increase the supply of metals and shifted
its composition. A future steady increase in institutions
along with slowing demand could lead to excess supply
and exercise further downward pressure on prices.

CHAPTER 1

Recent Developments and Prospects

Box 1.1. What Is the Effect of Recessions?
The global financial crisis put the spotlight on the issue
of hysteresis, the hypothesis that recessions may have
permanent effects and lead to lower output later. Figure 1.1.1 shows why. The figure shows the evolution of
U.S. and euro area output since 2000. Its visually striking
implication is that, since the global financial crisis, output
appears to be evolving on a lower path, perhaps even a
lower growth path, especially in the euro area.
To get a sense of how unusual such evolution is,
Blanchard, Cerutti, and Summers (2015) look at 122
recessions in 23 advanced economies since the 1960s.
Their analysis of the relative evolution of output after
each recession takes a nonparametric approach that
estimates and extrapolates prerecession trends—taking
into account, among other factors, that an economy
may have been in a boom, and thus above trend,
before the recession started. Figure 1.1.2 shows the
case of Portugal, which is representative of other
countries. All but one of the recessions in Portugal
since 1960 appear to be associated not only with
lower output relative to trend, but with a subsequent
decrease in trend growth, and thus increasing gaps
between actual and past trend output.
More generally, these authors’ analysis of the average
output gaps between the prerecession trend and actual
log GDP (covering from three to seven years after the
recession) concludes that a surprisingly high two-thirds
of recessions are followed by lower output relative to the
prerecession trend. Even more surprisingly, almost half of
those are followed not only by lower output, but also by
lower output growth relative to the prerecession trend.
But correlation does not necessarily imply causality.
One can think of three different explanations:
• Hysteresis: A number of mechanisms have been suggested that could generate lower output paths after
recessions. Financial crises, like the recent global
meltdown, often trigger institutional changes, such
as tougher capital requirements or changes in bank
business models, which could affect the long-term
level of output. In the labor market, a recession
and the associated high unemployment may lead
some workers either to drop out permanently or
to become unemployable.1 Firms may cut back
on research and development during a recession,
The authors of this box are Olivier Blanchard and Eugenio
Cerutti, drawing on Blanchard, Cerutti, and Summers 2015.
1Blanchard and Summers (1986) also relate the increase in
unemployment in Europe during the 1980s to hysteresis in the
form of prolonged unemployment episodes leading to a change
in labor market institutions.

leading to a lower productivity level than had there
not been a recession. It is more difficult, but not
impossible, to think of mechanisms through which
a recession leads to lower output growth later.2 A
recession may trigger changes in behavior or to
institutions’ permanently cutting back on research
and development or lowering reallocation forever.
Changes may range from increased legal or selfimposed restrictions on risk taking by financial
institutions to changes in taxation discouraging
entrepreneurship.
• Dynamic effects of supply shocks: Supply shocks (for
example, oil shocks and financial crises) may be
behind both the recession and the lower output
later. For example, it is plausible to argue that the
sharp decline in output at the start of the global
crisis and the subsequent lower growth path stem
from the same underlying cause—namely, the crisis
in the financial system, manifesting itself through
an acute effect at the start and a more chronic effect
thereafter.
• Reverse causality: A recession could be partly due
to the anticipation of lower growth to come. For
example, an exogenous decrease in underlying

growth rate from its impact on the level of output, Ball (2014)
calls the former “super-hysteresis.”

potential growth might lead households to reduce
consumption and firms to reduce investment, leading to an initial recession.
To distinguish between these three explanations,
Blanchard, Cerutti, and Summers (2015) focus on
decompositions based on the recessions’ proximate
cause. They home in on recessions induced by intentional disinflation—demand shock recessions characterized by a large increase in nominal interest rates
followed by subsequent disinflation—in which the
correlation is more likely to reflect hysteresis than the
other two hypotheses. They find that, even for those
recessions, the proportion followed by lower output
relative to the prerecession trend is substantial (in
about 17 of the 28 intentional-disinflation recessions).
The policy implications of these findings are important, but potentially conflicting. When hysteresis is
present, in general, macroeconomic policies must be
more aggressive. Deviations of output from its optimal
level are much longer lasting and thus more costly
than usually assumed. Nevertheless, to the extent that
the other two explanations are also relevant, there is
the risk of overestimating potential output during and
after a recession, and by implication of overestimating the output gap. Macroeconomic policies based on
an overestimated output gap may turn out to be too
aggressive. Hence, the macroeconomic policy mix must
be not only country specific, but also recession specific.

Recent Developments and Prospects

Box 1.2. Small Economies, Large Current Account Deficits
Despite the narrowing of global current account
imbalances, the number of countries with large current
account deficits remains high. Over the period 2012–
14, 62 countries had an average current account deficit
exceeding 7 percent of GDP—only 4 fewer than
over 2005–08.1 This box presents stylized facts on the
characteristics of these countries and tries to shed light
on the potential drivers of their external borrowing
and their external vulnerabilities.
The first striking fact about these countries is their
small size. Despite representing about one-third of
the IMF membership and half of the countries with
current account deficits, their aggregate GDP is below
1½ percent of world GDP at market prices, and their
aggregate current account deficit is about one-tenth of
global current account deficits (somewhat smaller than
the deficit in the United Kingdom). Their geographic
distribution is heterogeneous, with 22 economies in
sub-Saharan Africa, 12 in the Caribbean, 3 in Central
America, 5 in the Pacific islands, 4 in Asia, 7 in the
Middle East and North Africa, 5 in emerging Europe,
and 4 in the Commonwealth of Independent States.
Roughly half are low-income countries, and the other
half are emerging markets. Table 1.2.1 provides a

Maria Milesi-Ferretti.
1The number of countries with current account surpluses
exceeding 7 percent of GDP in 2012–14 was much smaller (15),

oil exporters.

They are also highly dependent on oil imports.
Table 1.2.2 examines more formally whether the
variables in Table 1.2.1 are systematically related to
current account balances, estimating a simple crosssectional regression in which the dependent variable
is the average current-account-to-GDP ratio over the
period 2012–14 and the parsimonious set of explanatory variables includes GDP per capita, population,
and a proxy for net oil exports and imports over the
same time period. There is of course a vast literature estimating current account regressions (see, for
instance, Chinn and Prasad 2003, Lee and others 2008, and Prati and others 2011). In contrast to

that in most of the literature, the focus here is purely
on the cross-section, and the very limited number of
control variables permits a truly global sample (wider
than commonly used samples).
Results show a very strong cross-sectional relationship between current account balances and GDP per
capita: for instance, a country with GDP per capita
of $5,000 will have on average a current account
balance 6 percentage points of GDP stronger than a
country with GDP per capita of $1,000. The regression also yields a positive relationship between current
account balances and population, which is statistically
and economically significant, after GDP per capita is
controlled for. For instance, a country with a population of 10 million has on average a current account
balance that is about 2.8 percentage points of GDP
stronger than a country with the same GDP per capita
but a population of 1 million. These results are not
specific to the 2012–14 period, as shown in column
(2) of Table 1.2.2. Possible reasons why countries

54

with smaller populations have on average larger
deficits are discussed later in this box.2 A dummy
for oil exporters is also highly significant, and even
more so the oil trade balance. Column (3) shows that
the significance of population is not solely driven by
Caribbean islands, which have large deficits and very
small populations—but it suggests that these countries
do run larger deficits than others, after their size and
level of development are controlled for. The intensity
of their oil dependence is clearly a factor explaining
their deficits—as shown in column (4), substituting
the oil balance for the oil exporter dummy reduces the
economic and statistical significance of the Caribbean
dummy.

International Monetary Fund | October 2015

Figure 1.2.1 provides information on the structure of external financing for the countries in the
large-deficit sample. These countries have relied to
an important extent on net foreign direct investment
(FDI) flows—the median is about 5 percentage points
of GDP—as well as net flows of other investments (a
broad category including private and official loans).
This variable understates net inflows in the presence
of debt relief, since the latter is recorded as a capital
account transfer accompanied by a repayment of other
investment liabilities. Indeed, capital account transfers
account for close to 1 percent of GDP of median
current account financing. Median portfolio flows are
negligible, even though a few countries have relied
heavily on them. Neither median changes in foreign
exchange reserves nor errors and omissions play an
important role.
Given the balance of payments identity, net sources
of current account financing are also correlated with
both GDP per capita and population. The correlation
is especially strong for capital account transfers, foreign
official flows, and foreign direct investment—all of
which are proportionately higher, as a share of domestic GDP, in poor countries as well as in countries with
small populations.
2Since the current-account-to-GDP ratio in small economies
tends to be more volatile than that in larger ones, countries with
small populations could be overrepresented in the sample of
large-deficit countries. But volatility is unlikely to be the main
driver of the relationship between population and the current
account, as the negative correlation between these variables is systematic across all countries. Moreover, small economies are not
overrepresented in the sample of countries with large surpluses.

CHAPTER 1

Recent Developments and Prospects

Box 1.2 (continued)
Drivers of Large External Financing
Large current account deficits can in principle be
associated with a variety of factors:
• Sizable reliance on development assistance, particularly in small economies: Countries with smaller
populations tend to receive more aid as a share of
GDP than larger nations (see Alesina and Dollar 2005).3 With greater reliance on aid flows, the
current account balance can overstate the access to
external borrowing (through grants classified under
the capital account), and borrowing costs may be
lower than for other countries, given concessional
loans. Indeed, if the financial account is used as the
dependent variable in the regressions of Table 1.2.2
(thereby netting out the part of current account
financing accounted for by capital transfers), the
link with population size weakens, both economically and statistically.
• Legacy effects from large past external borrowing,
which imply a strongly negative income balance:
Such legacy effects are intensified by low economic
growth.
• Negative growth shocks, such as natural disasters or
conflicts, which (temporarily) curtail a country’s production possibilities, as well as the induced increase in
spending associated with reconstruction needs: In small
states, the macroeconomic consequences of natural
disasters are particularly large, as these shocks tend
to affect a larger share of the population and of the
economy.4 While existing estimates of the GDP cost
of natural disasters are not a significant determinant of current account balances when added to
the regression specifications of Table 1.2.2, these
estimates’ incomplete coverage poses a challenge
to testing their empirical relevance in a reliable
fashion.
• Measurement issues: The sample of large-deficit
countries includes 18 with tourism-based economies, for which there is anecdotal evidence that
tourist spending may be underestimated and hence
the current account deficit overestimated (see, for
instance, IMF 2015d). When added to the regres3Hence, a country’s size, measured by its population, has been
used as a measure of donor interest (Bräutigam and Knack 2004)
and as an instrument for aid flows (see, for instance, Rajan and
Subramanian 2008).
4It is estimated that natural disasters cost microstates (countries with populations of 200,000 or less) between 3 and 5
percent of GDP annually (Jahan and Wang 2013).

sions presented in Table 1.2.2, tourism revenues as a
share of total exports are negatively correlated with
the current account balance (and reduce the size
and significance of the coefficient on population),
consistent with the hypothesis that such revenues
may be underestimated. Analogously, large-deficit
countries rely more on remittances than other deficit countries.5 However, these flows are notoriously
difficult to distinguish from capital inflows and to
measure accurately, for instance, because individual
remittances often fall below financial institutions’
reporting thresholds (see UNECE 2011).
Different countries in the diverse high current
account deficit sample fall into each of these categories. Chronic current account deficits with low GDP
per capita and sizable reliance on development assistance is the most common profile among countries in
the sample. Indeed, while some 50 countries in the
group experienced a worsening in current account
deficits relative to their average current account values
during 1995–2011, only 11 of them had deficits averaging less than 5 percent of GDP during the earlier
period. In a number of these countries, legacy effects
from past external borrowing were alleviated through
debt forgiveness or debt reduction agreements, either
during the 2012–14 period or in the preceding decade
(for instance, Liberia, Mozambique, and St. Kitts
and Nevis). However, the number of countries with
very high net external liabilities remains elevated, as
discussed next.
Turning to reasons for sizable changes in current
account balances, Mauritania, Mongolia, Mozambique, and Papua New Guinea have had booms in
FDI related to natural resources, and The Bahamas,
Grenada, and Guyana have had natural disasters with
estimated macroeconomic costs exceeding 2 percentage
points of GDP a year.

External Risks for High-Deficit Countries
Many countries in the large-deficit sample have
structural vulnerabilities. For instance, small developing states, which constitute a third of the sample,
face vulnerabilities and policy challenges due to their
size, which adds to production and distribution costs,
hampers the delivery of public goods, poses other
administrative capacity constraints, and leaves them
5The median remittances-to-GDP ratio is roughly 3 percent
in large-deficit countries and close to zero for other deficit
countries.

with minimal diversification against external shocks,
including natural disasters (IMF 2013, 2015e).
More generally, with sizable reliance on external
financing, countries in this sample are generally sensitive
to changes in the global macroeconomic environment,
given their generally small size, openness, and reliance on external financing. These changes include, for
example, a tightening of external financing conditions
and a growth slowdown in emerging market economies.
Declines in commodity prices hurt natural resource
exporters, but as Table 1.1.1 highlights, lower oil prices
are actually beneficial for a large majority of countries
in this group. Of course an assessment of external sector
risks has to take into account sizable differences in the
macroeconomic environment, as well as the level and
structure of external financing—and risks arising from
external factors are exacerbated by domestic macroeconomic shocks and weak economic growth.

56

International Monetary Fund | October 2015

A heavy reliance on portfolio flows to finance large
current account deficits can imply a higher risk of capital flow reversals should global attitudes toward risk
change. For the period 2012–14, 10 countries in the
large-deficit group (excluding financial centers, which
by their nature have large portfolio flows) had average
net portfolio inflows exceeding 2 percent of GDP (for
instance, Ghana, Kenya, Mongolia, and Serbia).
Furthermore, 5 countries in the sample, including countries with conflicts such as Ukraine, as well
as others such as Papua New Guinea, had substantial
drawdowns in foreign exchange reserves during 2012–
14 (averaging more than 2 percent of GDP a year).
In addition, with large and persistent current
account deficits, a sizable number of countries in
the sample have high net external liabilities, despite
the external transfers and debt reduction agreements
discussed earlier (Figure 1.2.2). In many countries, net
FDI represents the lion’s share of net foreign liabilities.
The value of FDI liabilities is generally tied to a country’s economic prospects, which implies better risk
sharing in comparison to foreign-currency debt.6 This
notwithstanding, large FDI liabilities also imply sizable
income outflows, and a country with large FDI liabilities is still vulnerable to a sharp decline in FDI flows,
should its prospects or those for the sector in which its
FDI is primarily located (for example, resource extraction or tourism) deteriorate.
Figure 1.2.2 also shows that external debt liabilities
net of reserves exceed 40 percent of GDP in more
than half of the sample of countries, and empirical evidence suggests that a country’s net external
debt position is correlated with the probability of an
external crisis (Catão and Milesi-Ferretti 2014). In a
number of countries in the sample, the sizable share of
concessional loans is a mitigating factor (for more than
20 of them, that share was above 50 percent in 2013).
However, the share of concessional loans is generally
declining and is below one-third for about half of the
sample.
In sum, this box documents that a sizable number
of countries still run large current account deficits.
These countries are overwhelmingly small—in terms of
GDP per capita, population, or both. Factors that can
6In a number of cases a large share of FDI inflows is associated
with matching imports of machinery and equipment. Therefore, a decline in FDI could reduce FDI-related imports and
strengthen the current account balance, as was the case in many
countries in the Caribbean during the global financial crisis.

CHAPTER 1

Recent Developments and Prospects

Box 1.3. Capital Flows and Financial Deepening in Developing Economies
Low-income developing countries have integrated
significantly with global financial markets over the past
few decades—with annual gross private capital inflows
increasing from $4 billion in the early 1980s to more
than $60 billion in recent years, representing almost
6.4 percent of GDP in 2013.1 This acceleration, which
occurred together with the commodity price boom,
has been driven by foreign direct investment, which
has increased from about 2 percent of GDP in the
early 2000s to more than 4 percent since 2011. Other
inflows to the nonofficial sector have also increased
in recent years, but they still account for less than
1.5 percent of GDP. Portfolio flows have been a
negligible source of external financing for low-income
developing countries, although they have been increasing recently in some frontier economies (Araujo and
others 2015).
Low-income developing countries are typically more
credit constrained than advanced economies, and
capital inflows can be an important source of financial
deepening for these economies to stimulate investment
and efficient allocation of resources. Capital inflows
can raise private credit directly—through increased
bank deposits and collateral valuation effects (thanks
to increased asset prices)—and indirectly, through
their effect on macroeconomic and financial variables
that influence the demand for and the supply of
credit.2 Foreign direct investment could, for example,
have positive spillovers on local firms, easing financing
constraints (Harrison, Love, and McMillan 2004), and
increase their demand for credit.3
The authors of this box are Filippo Gori, Bin Grace Li, and
Andrea F. Presbitero.
1Weighted average; the unweighted average is 9.6 percent
of GDP. The definition of private capital inflows used here
follows Bluedorn and others 2013 and excludes from total
capital inflows changes in recorded reserves, IMF lending, and
other flows that record the official sector as a counterparty (for
example, other flows to the central bank or monetary authority
and general government, which are typically official lending or
aid).
2Recent studies have explored the relationship between financial integration and domestic financial deepening for advanced
and emerging market economies but not for low-income
developing countries. The size of the domestic banking system
and the scale of financial globalization have been shown to be
strongly correlated (Lane and Milesi-Ferretti 2008), and episodes
of capital inflows, mainly debt driven, have been associated with
an increase in domestic credit growth (Furceri, Guichard, and
Rusticelli 2012; Lane and McQuade 2014; Igan and Tan 2015).
3While foreign direct investment is often concentrated in
enclave sectors, it is becoming more important in manufacturing

Against this backdrop, this box examines the role of
global capital flows in driving credit to the private sector in low-income developing countries. Figure 1.3.1
suggests strong comovement between domestic bank
lending and international capital flows in these countries, although the acceleration in credit from the mid2000s surpassed that in capital inflows. The specific
contribution of the latter in driving private credit (as
a percentage of GDP) is identified here by estimating
the following specification:
CREDi,t = αCREDi,t–1 + βCFi,t + γXi,t + δi + ei,t .
The vector Xi,t includes a set of standard control variables (real per capita GDP, interest rate, GDP growth,
and a banking crisis dummy), while α measures the
persistence of private credit. The model is estimated
with annual data for a sample of 36 low-income
developing countries over the period 1980–2012, with
country fixed effects δi and robust clustered standard
errors.4
Given the obvious challenges in establishing a causal
relationship between capital flows and domestic credit,
the analysis relies on an instrument for capital inflows,
which are uncorrelated with domestic economic conditions in recipient economies (see Gori, Li, and Presbitero, forthcoming). Gross capital inflows to emerging
markets are taken as an instrument for capital inflows
to low-income developing countries on the basis of
the following three conditions. First, aggregate capital
inflows to emerging markets are strongly and positively
correlated with capital inflows to low-income developing countries, as shown in Figure 1.3.1, especially in
the period before the global financial crisis, and this is
confirmed by the first-stage coefficients (Table 1.3.1).5
and service sectors, with significant spillovers to domestic firms
(Amendolagine and others 2013).
4To deal with the volatility of capital flows during the global
financial crisis (see Figure 1.3.1), a dummy for 2008–12 is
added. The sample includes Bangladesh, Benin, Bolivia, Burkina
Faso, Cambodia, Cameroon, Republic of Congo, Djibouti,
Ethiopia, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti,
Honduras, Kenya, Lao P.D.R., Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi,
Mali, Mongolia, Mozambique, Nepal, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria,
Papua New Guinea, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Solomon
Islands, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, and Zambia. The analysis
focuses on the overall relationship between domestic credit
and capital flows, and although it controls for the incidence of
banking crises, financial stability risks related to the cyclicality of
capital flows are not tackled here.
5Moreover, the first-stage F-statistics are generally close to or
above the critical value of 10, which signals (for values below) a
weak instrument. Results are robust to the exclusion of the crisis

(calculated with cross-border ﬂows to the ofﬁcial sector
within other capital inﬂows stripped out) to the sample of 36
low-income developing countries (those used in the
regressions with at least 10 observations in each variable)
and total gross capital inﬂows to emerging markets are
based on IMF staff calculations; private credit refers to the
same sample of 36 low-income developing countries (LIDCs)
and is from the World Bank’s Global Financial Development
Database, integrated with the World Bank’s World
Development Indicators.

Second, they are unlikely to be affected by the countries’ economic performance. Third, for the uniqueness
condition, the instrument is valid only if it affects private credit through its effect on capital inflows. It is not
restrictive to imagine that capital inflows to emerging
markets could affect low-income developing countries
through international capital flows, but there may be
other channels at work, particularly trade. To control

years and the use of alternative instruments, such as the first
principal components of capital outflows from advanced economies and capital outflows from the United States.

for the trade channel, the set of controls includes the
trade balance of emerging markets.
A number of global factors affecting advanced and
developing economies at the same time could also
weaken the identification strategy, to the extent that
changes in such factors simultaneously affect capital inflows to emerging markets and to low-income
developing countries. A proxy for these factors is constructed by extracting the first principal component of
real GDP in a large sample of 135 advanced, emerging market, and developing economies. This variable
explains more than 82 percent of the cross-country
comovement in real GDP and is included as a measure
of the global business cycle. Given that a large share of
the countries in the sample are commodity exporters,
commodity prices and terms-of-trade shocks can boost
both private credit and capital inflows. To show that
results are not driven by commodity prices, the model
is also estimated on the sample of noncommodity
exporters.
The main results suggest that global capital
inflows contribute to private credit creation in
low-income developing countries, and this is true
also for noncommodity exporters (columns (4)–(6)
of the table).6 Quantitatively, a 1 percentage point
increase in total private capital inflows (as a share
of GDP) increases the private-credit-to-GDP ratio
by 0.32 percentage point (column 1). The results
are largely driven by foreign direct investment and
other private inflows (flows to the nonofficial sector, including bank loans and trade credit).7 The
response of domestic credit to foreign investment
may reflect direct local funding of foreign firms
and potential positive spillovers from foreign direct
investment increasing the demand for credit by local
firms. The statistically significant bearing between
private credit and other private flows, by contrast,
reflects a supply channel working through crossborder bank flows (although the magnitude of other
private flows is still relatively small in low-income
developing countries). These results contrast with
those of studies on advanced and emerging market
6Results are robust to the inclusion of country-specific net
commodity terms of trade (defined as in Gruss 2014; see Chapter 2 for details).
7When capital flows are measured by portfolio flows, the
model is weakly identified, and the coefficients on capital flows
are imprecisely estimated. For that reason, results are not shown
in Table 1.3.1. Results are similar when net flows are used.

economies that find portfolio debt flows to be more
important drivers of private credit (Furceri, Guichard, and Rusticelli 2012; Lane and McQuade 2014).
For low-income developing countries, portfolio debt
and equity flows represent only a tiny fraction of
total flows, and there is no robust correlation with
domestic credit.

This analysis identifies a causal relationship between
capital flows and domestic private credit in lowincome developing countries—confirming the potentially enabling role of global financial integration for
financial deepening in these countries, conditional on
financial depth itself being a robust driver of economic
growth and development.

WHERE ARE COMMODITY EXPORTERS HEADED?
OUTPUT GROWTH IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE COMMODITY BOOM

Commodity prices have declined sharply over the past
three years, and output growth has slowed considerably
among those emerging market and developing economies that are net exporters of commodities. A critical
question for policymakers in these countries is whether
commodity windfall gains and losses influence potential output or merely trigger transient fluctuations of
actual output around an unchanged trend for potential output. The analysis in this chapter suggests that
both actual and potential output move together with
the commodity terms of trade but that actual output comoves twice as strongly as potential output. The
weak commodity price outlook is estimated to subtract
almost 1 percentage point annually from the average
rate of economic growth in commodity exporters over
2015–17 as compared with 2012–14. In exporters of
energy commodities, the drag is estimated to be larger—
about 2¼ percentage points on average over the same
period. The projected drag on the growth of potential
output is about one-third of that for actual output.

Introduction
After rising dramatically for almost a decade, the
prices of many commodities, especially those of energy
and metals, have dropped sharply since 2011 (Figure 2.1). Many analysts have attributed the upswing
in commodity prices to sustained strong growth in
emerging market economies, in particular those in
east Asia, and the downswing to softening growth in
these economies and a greater supply of commodities.1
Commodity prices are notoriously difficult to predict,

slowing emerging market growth on commodity prices, see “Special

After a dramatic rise in the 2000–10 period, the prices of many commodities have
been dropping sharply. The cycle has been especially pronounced for energy and

Note: “Commodity exporters” are emerging market and developing economies for
which gross exports of commodities constitute at least 35 percent of total exports
and net exports of commodities constitute at least 5 percent of exports-plusimports on average, based on the available data for 1960–2014. “Other emerging

developing economies that are not included in the commodity exporters group.
Countries are selected for each group so as to have a balanced sample from 1990
to 2015. Outliers, deﬁned as economies in which any annual growth rate during the
period exceeds 30 percent (in absolute value terms), are excluded.

growth forecasts since 2012, while the medium-term
growth forecasts of other emerging market and developing economies have remained broadly unchanged.
Weaker commodity prices raise key questions for
the outlook in commodity-exporting economies. One
that looms large is whether commodity-price-related
fluctuations in growth are mostly cyclical or structural.
The flip side of this question is whether the faster
rate of output growth during the commodity boom
reflected a cyclical overheating as opposed to a higher
rate of growth in potential output.2 Distinguishing
between the cyclical and structural components of
growth is not straightforward in any business cycle; it
is particularly challenging during prolonged commodity booms, when a persistent pickup in incomes and
demand makes it harder to estimate the underlying
trend in output.3
The diagnosis of how actual and potential growth is
influenced by commodity price fluctuations is crucial
for the setting of macroeconomic policies in commodity exporters. Price declines that lead to a mostly cyclical slowdown in growth could call for expansionary
macroeconomic policies (if policy space is available)
to pick up the slack in aggregate demand. In contrast,
lower growth in potential output would tend to imply
a smaller amount of slack and, therefore, less scope
for stimulating the economy using macroeconomic
policies. In countries where the decline in commodity
prices leads to a loss in fiscal revenues, weaker potential
output growth would also require fiscal adjustments to
ensure public debt sustainability.
This chapter contributes to the literature on the
macroeconomic effects of booms and downturns in
the commodity terms of trade (the commodity price
cycle) in net commodity exporters.4 Using a variety of
empirical approaches, it makes a novel contribution

the commodity, future spot prices will remain low or
rebound only moderately over the next five years.
The decline in commodity prices has been accompanied by stark slowdowns in economic growth among
commodity-exporting emerging market and developing economies, most of which had experienced high
growth during the commodity price boom (Figure 2.2). Besides the decline in growth, commodity
exporters have also seen downgrades in their mediumterm growth prospects: almost 1 percentage point has
been shaved off the average of their five-year-ahead

output is defined in this chapter as the amount of
output in an economy consistent with stable inflation. Actual output
may deviate from potential output because of the slow adjustment
of prices and wages to changes in supply and demand. In most of
the empirical analysis, potential output is proxied by trend output—
based on an aggregate production function approach and using the
growth rates of the capital stock as well as smoothed employment
and total factor productivity series. Chapter 3 of the April 2015
World Economic Outlook includes a primer on potential output
(pp. 71–73).

4A country’s “terms of trade” refers to the price of its exports in
terms of its imports. The concept of “commodity terms of trade”
as used in this chapter refers to the price of a country’s commodity exports in terms of its commodity imports. It is calculated as a
country-specific weighted average of international commodity prices,
for which the weights used are the ratios of the net exports of the

WHERE ARE COMMODIT Y EXPORTERS HEADED? OUTPUT GROWTH IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE COMMODITY BOOM

by analyzing changes in the cyclical versus structural
components of output growth in small open net
­commodity-exporting economies during the commodity price cycle.5 The empirical analysis focuses
on emerging market and developing economies that
are net exporters of commodities, with the exception
of case studies that examine the sectoral reallocation
resulting from commodity booms in Australia, Canada,
and Chile. The chapter also uses model-based simulations to analyze the impact of the commodity price
cycle on income, domestic demand, and output; that
investigation draws on the IMF’s Global Economy
Model (GEM), which has a full-fledged commodities
sector and is hence uniquely suited to this analysis.6
Specifically, the chapter seeks to answer the following questions about the effects of the commodity price
cycle:
•• Macroeconomic effects: How do swings in the commodity terms of trade affect key macroeconomic
variables—including output, spending, employment,
capital accumulation, and total factor productivity
(TFP)? How different are the responses of actual
and potential output? Do the economies of commodity exporters overheat during commodity
booms?
•• Policy influences: Do policy frameworks influence the
variation in growth over the cycle?
•• Sectoral effects: How do swings in the commodity terms of trade affect the main sectors of the
economy—commodity producing, manufacturing,
relevant commodity to the country’s total commodity trade. Details
of the calculation are provided in Annex 2.1.
5The literature has mostly focused on the comparative longerterm growth record of commodity exporters. Surveys can be found
in van der Ploeg 2011 and Frankel 2012. Other major topics in
the literature include the contribution of terms-of-trade shocks to
macroeconomic volatility (for example, Mendoza 1995 and SchmittGrohé and Uribe 2015), the comovement between the commodity
terms of trade and real exchange rate (for example, Chen and Rogoff
2003 and Cashin, Céspedes, and Sahay 2004), the impact of natural
resource discoveries on activity in the nonresource sector (Corden
and Neary 1982; van Wijnbergen 1984a, 1984b), and the relationship between terms-of-trade movements and the cyclical component
of output (Céspedes and Velasco 2012). Chapter 1 of the October
2015 Fiscal Monitor discusses the optimal management of resource
revenues, a topic that has also been the subject of a large literature
(for example, IMF 2012).
6This chapter is a sequel to Chapter 3 of the April 2015 World
Economic Outlook, which provides estimates of potential output
for 16 major economies for the past two decades, and to Chapter 4
of the April 2012 World Economic Outlook, which examines the
growth implications of commodity price movements driven by global
production versus global demand and the optimal fiscal management
of commodity windfalls.

imply for the growth prospects of commodityexporting economies over the next few years?
The main findings of the chapter are as follows:
Macroeconomic effects
•• Swings in the commodity terms of trade lead to
fluctuations in both the cyclical and structural components of output growth, with the former tending
to be about twice the size of the latter. In previous
prolonged terms-of-trade booms, annual actual
output growth tended to be 1.0 to 1.5 percentage points higher on average during upswings than
in downswings, whereas potential output growth
tended to be only 0.3 to 0.5 percentage point
higher. These averages mask considerable diversity
across episodes, including in regard to the underlying changes in the terms of trade.
•• The strong response of investment to swings in the
commodity terms of trade is the main driver of
changes in potential output growth over the cycle.
In contrast, employment growth and TFP growth
contribute little to the variations in potential output
growth.
Policy influences, sectoral effects, and growth outlook
•• Certain country characteristics and policy frameworks can influence how strongly output growth
responds to the swings in the commodity terms of
trade. Growth responds more strongly in countries
specialized in energy commodities and metals and in
countries with a low level of financial development.
Less flexible exchange rates and more procyclical
fiscal spending patterns (that is, stronger increases in
fiscal spending when the commodity terms of trade
are improving) also tend to exacerbate the cycle.
•• Case studies of Australia, Canada, and Chile suggest
that investment booms in commodity exporters are
mostly booms in the commodity sector itself. Evidence of large-scale movements of labor and capital
to nontradables activities is mixed.
•• All else equal, the weak commodity price outlook
is projected to subtract about 1 percentage point
annually from the average rate of economic growth
in commodity-exporting economies over 2015–17
as compared with 2012–14. In energy exporters the
drag is estimated to be larger, about 2¼ percentage
points on average.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: ADJUSTING TO LOWER COMMODITY PRICES

The findings of the chapter suggest that, on average, some two-thirds of the decline in output growth
in commodity exporters during a commodity price
downswing should be cyclical. Whether the decline
in growth has opened up significant economic slack
(that is, has increased the quantity of labor and capital
that could be employed productively but is instead
idle) and the degree to which it has done so are likely
to vary considerably across commodity exporters. The
variation depends on the cyclical position of the economy at the start of the commodity boom, the extent
to which macroeconomic policies have smoothed
or amplified the commodity price cycle, the extent
to which structural reforms have bolstered potential
growth, and other shocks to economic activity. Nevertheless, a key takeaway for commodity exporters is
that attaining growth rates as high as those experienced
during the commodity boom will be challenging under
the current outlook for commodity prices unless critical supply-side bottlenecks that constrain growth are
alleviated rapidly.
The rest of the chapter is structured as follows.
First it discusses the macroeconomic implications of
a terms-of-trade windfall in a commodity-exporting
economy and presents illustrative model simulations.
It then presents two sets of empirical tests of whether
the evidence conforms to the model-based predictions, namely, event studies and regression-based
estimates. The event studies cover a large sample of
prolonged upswings and subsequent downswings in
the commodity terms of trade to document the key
regularities in the data; by design, they do not control
for contextual factors. To isolate the effects of the
terms-of-trade movements, regression-based estimates
of the responses of key macroeconomic variables to
terms-of-trade shocks are also presented. In addition, case studies examine the sectoral implications
of terms-of-trade booms. The chapter concludes with
a summary of the findings and a discussion of their
policy implications.

Commodity Terms-of-Trade Windfalls:
A Model-Based Illustration
How would commodity price cycles be expected
to affect small open economies that are net exporters of commodities (hereafter, commodity-exporting
economies)? This section first reviews the concept of
potential output and then turns to simulations of a
calibrated model that illustrate the response of a typical
68

International Monetary Fund | October 2015

commodity-exporting economy to a terms-of-trade
boom.

Preliminaries
The model-based analysis focuses on a commodity
cycle in which a surge in prices—driven by stronger
global demand—is followed by a partial, supply-driven
correction. This assumption is consistent with how
most analysts view the commodity price boom of
the 2000s. The correction is partial given the exhaustible nature of commodities and because income levels
in emerging markets are considered to have increased
permanently (with higher demand for commodities),
even if the increase in income may have been smaller
than what had been expected.7
Potential Output
The following discussion of the macroeconomic
implications of a terms-of-trade windfall distinguishes
between temporary effects on potential output (those
over a commodity cycle) and permanent effects
(beyond a commodity cycle). Over a commodity
cycle, potential output is defined as the level of output
consistent with stable inflation—in the model, this is
captured by the path of output under flexible prices.
The short-term divergence of actual output from
potential output—resulting from the slow adjustment
in prices—is referred to as the output gap. These two
components of output fluctuations can also be called
the “structural” and “cyclical” components. Beyond the
commodity cycle, potential output in a commodityexporting economy is driven by changes in global
income, the implied change in the relative price of
commodities, and any durable effects of the commodity price boom on domestic productive capacity (as
discussed next). All else equal, a permanent increase
in the commodity terms of trade would lead to an
increase in potential output.
With a growth-accounting framework (which measures the contribution to growth from various factors),
potential output can be decomposed into capital, labor,
and the remainder unexplained by those two—TFP.
Terms-of-trade booms can affect the path of potential
7The empirical analysis in the next section shows that this pattern
of commodity cycles also characterizes the average commodity cycle
during the past five decades, in which an initial price boom is followed by a partial correction. The model captures the exhaustibility
of commodities with land as a unique and important production
input for commodities but not for other goods.

CHAPTER 2

output through each of these three components. More
durable changes in potential growth are possible to the
extent that productivity growth is affected.
Capital. A commodity terms-of-trade boom that is
expected to persist for some time will increase investment in the commodity sector and in supportive
industries.8 A broader pickup in investment could be
facilitated by a lower country risk premium and an easing of borrowing constraints that coincide with better
commodity terms of trade. Higher investment rates in
the commodity and noncommodity sectors, in turn,
will raise the economy’s level of productive capital and
hence raise the level (but not the permanent growth
rate) of its potential output.
Labor supply. Large and persistent terms-of-trade
booms may also affect potential employment. Structural unemployment may decline following a period
of low unemployment through positive hysteresis
effects. Lower unemployment rates may also encourage entry into the labor force as well as job search,
raising the trend participation rate. As with investment, the labor supply channels have an effect on the
level of potential output, but not on its permanent
growth rate.
Total factor productivity. Terms-of-trade booms can
raise TFP by inducing faster adoption of technology
and higher spending on research and development.
The sectoral reallocation of labor and capital during a
terms-of-trade boom could also influence economywide TFP, but the sign of the effect is uncertain
beforehand (because factors of production may be
reallocated from high- to low-productivity sectors and
vice versa).
Although the increases in productive capital and the
labor force during a commodity price boom translate
into increased potential output, this increase may not
be sustainable. For example, investment may no longer
be viable at lower commodity prices (once the boom
has abated); thus the growth rate of aggregate investment may fall along with the terms of trade.
Transmission Channels for Commodity Cycles
Upswings in the commodity terms of trade affect
the macroeconomy through two main channels,
income and investment.
Income. The commodity price boom generates an
income windfall, as existing levels of production yield
greater revenues. Higher income boosts domestic
8See

also the discussion in Gruss 2014.

demand and thereby stimulates domestic production.
Because the income windfall is generated by more
favorable terms of trade, the response of real domestic output is more subdued than that of income and
domestic demand.9 This was indeed the case during
the most recent commodity boom (2000–10) (Figure 2.3). Consistent with the Dutch disease effect, the
domestic supply response to higher domestic income
occurs disproportionately in the nontradables sector
because demand for tradables can be met in part by a
rise in imports.10 In the process, the prices of the relatively scarce nontradable goods and services increase
relative to the prices of tradables, and the real exchange
rate appreciates.
Investment. In addition, commodity price booms
heighten incentives to invest in the commodity sector and supporting industries—such as construction,
transportation, and logistics. The resulting increase in
economic activity ultimately generates spillovers to the
rest of the economy and raises incomes further. Moreover, in the medium term, the increase in the supply of
commodities can reverse the commodity price boom,
contributing to the commodity cycle itself.11
The income and investment channels are interrelated. The income gain in the domestic economy
will be higher and more broadly based if investment
and activity in the commodity sector respond more
strongly to the increase in the terms of trade. Likewise,
a greater income windfall will make higher investment
more likely.

9Kohli (2004) and Adler and Magud (2015) show that real GDP
tends to underestimate the increase in real domestic income when
the terms of trade improve. In addition, Adler and Magud (2015)
provide estimates of the income windfall during commodity termsof-trade booms during 1970–2012.
10An extensive theoretical and empirical literature studies the
Dutch disease effect (see Box 2.1 for an overview).
11The strength of the supply response in the commodity sector
depends on the sector’s maturity. That is, output in the sector
will respond more to a boom the more potential there is for new
resource discoveries and the less costly it is to ramp up production
volumes. Anecdotal evidence from some countries in the 2000s
boom illustrates the case of a relatively more mature sector: boosting
or even just maintaining production required extractive companies
to dig deeper, use more sophisticated technology, and incur higher
costs than in the past; thus, the boom in commodity sector investment was associated with only a relatively modest rise in commodity
output.

Figure 2.3. Real Income, Output, and Domestic Demand,

The 2000–10 commodity price boom sharply improved the terms of trade for
commodity exporters and induced an income windfall. Real domestic income and
demand in the median commodity-exporting economy increased considerably
more than real output.

In the simulations, the commodity boom is induced
by a temporary pickup in growth in east Asia.13 The

the boom in a typical Latin American economy, as the

Model-Based Illustrations
The effects of a commodity price cycle on a ­commodityexporting economy are illustrated here using GEM.12
12GEM is a micro-founded multicountry and multisector dynamic
general equilibrium model of the global economy. Its key features
are a commodities sector with land as a major nonreproducible
production factor; conventional real and nominal frictions, such
as sticky prices and wages; adjustment costs for capital and labor;
habit formation in consumption; a fraction of liquidity-constrained
consumers; and a financial accelerator mechanism. For a detailed
description of GEM, see Lalonde and Muir 2007 and Pesenti 2008.

70

International Monetary Fund | October 2015

The growth pickup in east Asia is calibrated so
that the commodity price index in the commodity-­
exporting country gradually increases by 20 percent
over a 10-year period (Figure 2.4).15 The more favorable terms of trade boost income and consumption
in the exporter’s economy. Meeting the surge in
demand from domestic supply requires front-loading
an increase in investment, which is followed by an
increase in output. In response to higher demand, to
capital deepening (that is, an increase in capital per
worker), and to the resulting increase in real wages,
the other factor of production—labor—also increases
during the boom.
An important question that the model can help clarify
relates to the relative contributions of cyclical and structural factors in the supply boom. In the model, increases
in output during the commodity cycle are decomposed
into the structural and cyclical contributing factors.
First, under flexible prices the income windfall gives rise
to an increase in demand and output (the structural
component). Second, a slow adjustment in prices (in the
presence of “sticky prices” given nominal rigidities) exacerbates the response of economic activity in the short term
(the cyclical component—the deviation of actual output
from potential output). The flexible- and sticky-price versions of the model are used to decompose the response in
actual output and labor into contributions from these two
factors (Figure 2.4, panels 2 and 4).
13This choice is motivated by the broad agreement among market
analysts that fast growth in east Asia was a major force behind the
surge in commodity prices between the late 1990s and 2008 (for a
list of references on this topic, see note 1). The assumed duration of
the pickup in east Asian growth in the model is selected to match
this episode.
14Latin America, one of the six regions included in the model,
accounts for about 6¼ percent of world output. The region is
parameterized as a net exporter of commodities, with the commodities sector accounting for 11 percent of output. The commodities
sector in the model is further divided into oil and non-oil commodities of approximately equal size, with a lower price elasticity of
demand in the oil sector. All results reported in this section refer to
the aggregate commodities sector.
15Figure 2.4 reports the responses of the model to the boom in the
relative price of commodities (baseline scenario), presented as percentage deviations from the no-boom case.

CHAPTER 2

WHERE ARE COMMODIT Y EXPORTERS HEADED? OUTPUT GROWTH IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE COMMODITY BOOM

The results show that both structural and cyclical
components contribute to the supply response following the commodity price boom; that is, the slow
adjustment in prices and wages leads actual output
to increase more than potential output. The cyclical
component—reflected in a positive output gap—drives
a pickup in inflation during the boom. A key takeaway
from this exercise is that an important component of
the boom is structural—in the sense that a commodity
boom generates a gradual and significant increase in
capital, output, and employment even in the absence
of sticky prices.16
The income windfall increases demand in all sectors. However, domestic supply increases more in the
nontradables sector than in the tradables sector because
domestic tradable goods can more readily be substituted with imported tradable goods than nontradables
can be substituted with tradables.17 Whether supply
in the tradables sector increases or decreases depends
on the degree of substitutability between domestic
tradables and imports and whether the commodity
exporter is also a net exporter of tradables to east Asia,
where the global demand boom originates.
Partitioning the economy into three sectors—commodities, nontradables, and tradables—yields a distinct
pattern of resource reallocation (Figure 2.4, panels
5–8). Investment rises relative to the no-boom case in
all three sectors but more so in the commodities and
nontradables sectors. Employment is correspondingly
reallocated away from tradables and into commodities
and nontradables. Consistent with these sectoral shifts,
the relative price of nontradables to tradables increases,
and the real effective exchange rate appreciates. The
reproducible production factor—the capital stock—
grows in all sectors, including in tradables, because the
boom unambiguously increases demand in all sectors
(even if in relative terms, the increase is larger for
nontradables). Notably, in the model simulations, the
sectoral shares in real value added are little changed
because the fastest-growing commodities sector is small
(about 10 percent of GDP in the model), and the

16The gradual nature of the increase in potential output and
consumption is driven by real frictions, such as adjustment costs
in production factors, liquidity-constrained consumers, and habit
formation in consumption.
17That is, the elasticity of substitution is parameterized to be larger
within sectors than across sectors. The cross-sectoral shifts will be
largest if, within the tradables sector, domestic goods and imports are
perfect substitutes.

Commodity Boom
(Percent deviation, unless noted otherwise; years on x-axis)

The IMF’s Global Economy Model predicts that a commodity price boom should
induce higher investment, consumption, output, and labor effort in commodityexporting economies. The gains in output and labor effort have cyclical and
structural components. The model also predicts that these economies’ factors of
production will shift toward the nontradables and commodities sectors and that
the currency will appreciate in real terms.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: ADJUSTING TO LOWER COMMODITY PRICES

noncommodity parts of the economy get a boost from
the income windfall.
The Downswing
In the medium term (after year 10 in the model
simulations) the boom in commodity prices is partially
reversed by the dissipation of the growth pickup in
east Asia and the rise in the global supply of commodities in response to higher prices. The price reversal
sets in motion a downswing phase for the economy.
As income falls, all the forces outlined previously
for the upswing phase occur in reverse. The drop in
demand lowers supply. Actual output temporarily falls
below potential output. Labor is reallocated from the
commodities and nontradables sectors back into the
tradables sector. Value added drops most in the commodities sector and grows more in the tradables sector
than it does in the nontradables sector.
In the absence of permanent changes in the terms of
trade, the boom produces no lasting gains in potential
output. Put differently, potential output rises temporarily above a no-boom path and then returns to it. In
contrast, if the terms of trade remain higher than their
preboom level, as in the model simulations, the boom
leads to a permanent gain in potential output.

Additional Factors Affecting the Commodity Cycle
The baseline scenario suppresses numerous factors
that could influence the commodity cycle and its effect
on the commodity-exporting economy. Four such factors are expectations about the price of the commodity,
the reaction of fiscal policy to higher revenues, the easing of financial frictions due to the commodity boom,
and sectoral reallocation of capital and labor.
Commodity price expectations. Expectations are central to the commodity cycle. Consumption and investment in the commodity-exporting economy increase
only if the boom is expected to be long lasting. Overly
optimistic expectations regarding the persistence of the
boom can therefore aggravate the boom-bust cycle by
generating a greater boom in domestic demand during
the upswing, which in turn requires a greater correction in spending during the downswing. Overoptimism is more likely in the case of persistent upswings
in commodity prices, like those experienced in the
early 2000s. It can be global, rather than country specific; for example, the prices embedded in commodity
futures may not materialize.

72

International Monetary Fund | October 2015

To illustrate how overly optimistic expectations can
aggravate the cycle, the simulation compares the baseline scenario with a case in which the commodity price
is initially expected to increase gradually for more than
10 years. Up to year 10, these expectations are validated; then, expectations are corrected downward, and
the increase in the commodity price comes to a halt
(Figure 2.5). As a result, income is less than initially
expected. This scenario implies a more pronounced
initial boom in the commodity-exporting economy
because the expected wealth gain from the commodity
price boom is larger than in the baseline case. In the
aftermath of the boom, demand and supply dip below
the responses in the baseline to correct for the excessive
initial boom.
Fiscal policy. Much of the commodity price windfall
accrues to the government in commodity-producing
economies—especially in energy exporters. Thus, the
terms-of-trade boom may loosen the government
budget constraint and allow the government to finance
a higher level of spending. Moreover, the government’s
use of the income windfall can substantially affect the
economy’s response to the commodity price cycle.18
For example, if the government pursues a procyclical
fiscal policy during the boom, using the additional
revenues to reduce taxes on households or increase
consumption spending, it can aggravate the boom-bust
cycle in economic activity. Such a scenario is examined
in detail in Chapter 4 of the April 2012 World Economic Outlook. In contrast, if the government invests
in productivity-enhancing capital (whether infrastructure or human capital), productive capacity and
income can benefit over the longer term. The implications of such a scenario—using a model calibrated to a
low-income developing country—are examined in Box
2.2.
Financial frictions. The commodity boom increases
returns, thereby improving companies’ net worth
and reducing their leverage. Reduced leverage, in
turn, decreases both the premium firms pay to obtain
financing and their cost of capital. The result is to
reduce the economy’s financial frictions, broadly
defined. Increased global risk appetite during the boom
can further magnify this channel. The effect can be
illustrated with one summary measure of the cost of
external financing—sovereign bond yield spreads—
for a sample of commodity-exporting economies
18See the discussion in Chapter 1 of the October 2015 Fiscal
Monitor.

from 1997 to 2014 (Figure 2.6). The negative relationship between the country-specific terms of trade and
spreads implies that the cost of financing decreases for
exporters during commodity booms and increases during downswings.
The reduction in the cost of financing and the easing of financial frictions further boosts income and
potential output during the upswing; its effects reverse
during the downswing. The effect of the commodity
price cycle on financial frictions is therefore another
channel that aggravates the boom-bust dynamics in
a commodity-exporting economy. Such effects are
unlikely to affect the economy beyond the horizon of
the commodity cycle unless they lead to a sustained
improvement in financial sector development.
Sectoral reallocation. The responses in the baseline
scenario feature a shift of labor and capital away
from the noncommodity tradables sector toward the
commodity and nontradables sectors as part of the
equilibrium adjustment to the windfall. The sectoral reallocation of factors raises additional issues. If
manufacturing is associated with positive externalities
for the broader economy (such as learning-by-doing
externalities), the shrinking of the relative size of the
manufacturing sector can raise concerns.19 In addi2.1 provides a discussion of this issue.

tion, the reallocation could change the weights of the
different sectors in the overall economy and thus affect
measured aggregate TFP growth. Most applied macroeconomic models, including GEM, assume balanced
growth across sectors and thus abstract from such considerations. The case studies in the following section
investigate this issue by examining whether sectoral
shifts in activity during commodity booms have altered
aggregate TFP growth.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: ADJUSTING TO LOWER COMMODITY PRICES

studies are carried out to shed light on how actual
and potential output growth have behaved during and
after prolonged upswings in the commodity terms of
trade. The event study findings provide an overview
of the main regularities in the data. However, event
studies do not control for contextual factors (such
as the broader effects of global demand booms that
often accompany prolonged upswings in international
commodity prices). Therefore, in the second step,
the analysis uses a regression approach to isolate the
impact of changes in the terms of trade by controlling
for relevant contextual factors, such as output growth
in trading partners.
To capture the country-specific impact of global
commodity price movements, the analysis focuses on
the commodity terms of trade by weighting the global
prices of individual commodities according to countryspecific net export volumes.21 This approach has two
advantages compared with a focus on the changes in
the global price of a country’s most important export
commodity. First, few of the non-oil commodity
exporters are so specialized that focusing on the price
of a single commodity would be representative of the
changes in their terms of trade. Second, the approach
recognizes that fluctuations in commodity prices affect
countries differently depending on the composition
of both their exports and their imports. For instance,
despite the upswing in food and raw materials prices in
the 2000s, many agricultural commodity exporters did
not experience terms-of-trade windfalls given the even
stronger surge in their oil import bills.

Event Studies of Commodity Cycles with Pre-2000 Peaks
Since the recent declines in commodity prices have
occurred after an unusually prolonged boom phase,
the event studies focus on past episodes of persistent
at least 5 percent of its gross trade (exports plus imports) on average. A list of the countries and their shares of commodity exports
is provided in Annex Table 2.1.2. Exporters of energy commodities
and metals represent slightly more than 70 percent of the countries
in the sample.
21See Annex 2.1 for details. This approach follows Gruss 2014 and
builds on earlier work on gross country-specific commodity export
price indices in Deaton and Miller 1996, IMF 2006, and Spatafora
and Tytell 2009. Previous studies have used either price indices
of individual commodities or standard terms-of-trade measures
(exceptions include Deaton and Miller 1996, Dehn 2000, Cashin,
Céspedes, and Sahay 2004, Céspedes and Velasco 2012, and Gruss
2014). Most of the previous studies have focused on price changes
of at least a given magnitude, rather than a given duration, and on
samples of disjointed price increases or decreases.

upswings in the commodity terms of trade (Figure
2.7).22 Event studies are carried out for the cycles with
peaks before 2000 because the end of the downswing
phase cannot yet be identified for the post-2000
upswings. In this sample, the commodity terms of
trade increased by 63 percent on average during
upswings and declined by 24 percent on average over
the subsequent downswings. On average, upswings are
eight years long for extractive commodities and five
years long otherwise.
The event studies confirm that output and domestic spending tend to grow faster during upswings in
commodity terms of trade than in downswings. The
variation in investment growth—both private and
public—is particularly pronounced (Figure 2.8, panel
1).23 Investment and consumption contribute about
equally to the difference in the growth of real GDP, as
the stronger response of investment makes up for its
smaller share in overall spending.
Factors supporting domestic demand, such as credit
to the private sector and overall government spending, tend to expand more strongly in upswings than in
downswings (Figure 2.8, panel 2).24 Somewhat surprisingly, the real effective exchange rate in the identified
episodes did not appreciate during the average pre2000 upswing.25 However, breaking the sample into
episodes involving countries with fixed versus flexible
22Commodity price cycles are identified using an asymmetric BryBoschan Quarterly algorithm, following Harding and Pagan 2002
(Figure 2.7 presents three examples). Details of the algorithm are
in Annex 2.2. Annex 2.3 provides further details of the event study
analysis.
23During upswings, real GDP has grown about 1.5 percentage
points more a year than in downswings, real consumption about 2.0
to 2.5 percentage points more, and investment about 8.0 to 8.5 percentage points more. Differences are statistically significant at the 5
percent level for all of these variables.
24Husain, Tazhibayeva, and Ter-Martirosyan (2008) examine a
sample of 10 oil exporters and find that oil price changes affect the
economic cycle only through their impact on fiscal policy. Their
results are particularly stark for Gulf Cooperation Council countries,
in which all oil income accrues to the state. An interesting question
is whether governments use the windfall gains to invest in human
as well as physical capital. In the absence of consistently measured
cross-country data on education and health spending, Box 2.3 examines whether terms-of-trade booms are associated with improved
education and health outcomes.
25This pattern, however, holds only for the cycles with peaks
before 2000. During the pre-2000 upswings, factors other than the
commodity terms of trade appear to have dominated the movements
in the real exchange rate. By contrast, the most recent upswing is
more in line with priors, showing about 2.0 to 2.5 percent average
real appreciation a year. Regression analysis presented in Box 2.1
using data for 1970–2007 finds that the real exchange rate appreciates following increases in the commodity terms of trade.

The event studies focus on the behavior of variables during commodity terms-oftrade cycles with prolonged upswings that peaked before 2000. On average, those
upswings were eight years long for exporters of extractive commodities and ﬁve
years long otherwise, and the commodity terms of trade improved by 63 percent.

Output and domestic spending tend to grow faster during upswings in the
commodity terms of trade than in downswings. The growth of trend output tends
to vary as well, as capital accumulation comoves with the terms of trade. Credit to
the private sector and government spending expand faster during upswings, and
net capital inﬂows tend to be higher.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: ADJUSTING TO LOWER COMMODITY PRICES

exchange rate regimes reveals that flexible regimes have
been associated with currency appreciations during
upswings (and depreciations during downswings),
as would be expected, whereas depreciations have
occurred in fixed regimes during both upswings and
downswings.
The behavior of external accounts provides some
additional evidence that financing constraints loosen
during upswings. Even though outflows in the form of
official reserves and foreign direct investment rise when
commodity prices are high, net commodity exporters
have received, on average, slightly higher net capital
inflows during upswings than during downswings
(Figure 2.8, panel 3). Given the higher net inflows, no
general tendency toward improved net foreign asset
positions has been observed for upswings, even though,
as expected, current account balances have been
stronger in those episodes. Specifically, the average
ratio of net foreign assets to GDP has tended to rise
during upswings, a result driven by a few oil exporters,
while the median ratio has tended to decline more in
upswings than in downswings.
A growth-accounting perspective highlights the key
supply-side factors behind the cycle in output growth.
Aggregate production factors (capital and labor) and
TFP have tended to move in tandem with the changes
in the commodity terms of trade (Figure 2.8, panel 4).
The comovement is particularly strong for the rate of
change in the capital stock, which is consistent with
the substantially faster growth in investment spending
during upswings. The variation in employment growth
is driven by Latin America, where employment has
grown 1.5 percentage points more during upswings
than in downswings.
The growth rate of trend output—calculated using
estimates of the actual capital stock and smoothed
employment and TFP series—is considerably smoother
than that of actual output.26 In line with the modelbased predictions, trend output growth weakens during
downswings relative to upswings, but it does so with
less vigor than actual output growth. Annual actual
output growth has tended to be 1.0 to 1.5 percentage points higher on average during upswings than
in downswings, whereas potential output growth has
tended to be only 0.3 to 0.5 percentage point higher.
The fact that inflation tends to be higher during

upswings than in downswings (Figure 2.8, panel 2)
corroborates the notion of a smaller amount of slack
in the economy during upswings. As discussed in
Box 2.4, the experience of six commodity exporters
provides evidence of increasing output gaps during the
uninterrupted phase of the commodity boom in the
first decade of the 2000s.
The exchange rate regime, cyclicality of fiscal policy,
and depth of financial markets have a bearing on the
difference in growth between upswings and downswings (Figure 2.9). Countries with fixed exchange
rates tend to experience stronger variation in growth
relative to countries with flexible exchange rates. This
is consistent with the notion that a more flexible
exchange rate tends to act as a shock absorber and
cushion the domestic effects of terms-of-trade shocks.
Likewise, the difference in the growth rate of output
between upswings and downswings is larger in countries with more procyclical fiscal spending.27 Countries
with a lower level of credit to the private sector (relative to GDP) also exhibit stronger variation in growth.
The growth slowdown in these countries is sharper
during downswings, probably because they experience
a greater tightening of borrowing constraints when
commodity prices decline than do countries with
greater financial depth.28
Commodity exporters differ across many other
dimensions—in terms of the weight of commodities
in their aggregate production, the nature of the commodities they export (for example, exhaustible versus
renewable resource bases), and their levels of economic
and institutional development. As could be expected,
the growth patterns described previously are more
marked for economies that are less diversified, that is,
those in which commodity exports account for a larger
share of GDP. They are also clearer for exporters of
extractive commodities, whose economies tend to be
less diversified and face more persistent commodity
terms-of-trade cycles. Low-income countries have less
procyclical fiscal spending and a slightly lower degree
of commodity intensity in production but also less
flexible exchange rates and lower levels of financial
development. They exhibit greater variability in their
27Some correlation between fiscal spending and commodity prices
may be optimal. Cycles are classified here as having more procyclical
fiscal policy if the correlation between the growth of real spending
and the change in the commodity terms of trade is greater than the
sample median.
28This result is not driven by the variation in the level of economic
development, which tends to be correlated with financial depth.

growth rates for investment, employment, and TFP
compared with emerging market economies, but the
differences between the two groups are not statistically
significant (Annex 2.3).

The Boom of the 2000s
The event studies of commodity price cycles with
pre-2000 peaks provide evidence that is highly relevant
for the current downswing in commodity exporters.
Nevertheless, the most recent commodity price boom
was different in a number of dimensions from the
earlier booms. In particular, this boom entailed a larger
upswing in the terms of trade, especially for commodity exporters specializing in energy and metals.29 The
main reason for the difference is the greater number
of oil exporters in the recent upswing, for reasons
of data availability or more recent oil discovery and
development.
Nonetheless, the average annual growth rates of
key macroeconomic variables during the most recent
upswing were very similar to those in the pre-2000
upswings (Figure 2.10). However, investment and,
accordingly, capital accumulation and trend growth
were somewhat lower in the most recent upswing than
in previous upswings. Increases in real credit and government spending were also slightly lower.
Improvements in their macroeconomic policy frameworks and financial depth since the earlier episodes
have put commodity exporters in a better position to
deal with a downswing. Fiscal policy was considerably less procyclical during the most recent upswing:
the correlation of government spending growth with
changes in the commodity terms of trade fell to half of
what it was in the pre-2000 episodes. Reduced procyclicality is consistent with the finding of greater fiscal
savings out of commodity-based revenues in the 2000s,
as reported in Chapter 1 of the October 2015 Fiscal
Monitor. Financial depth and the extent of exchange
rate flexibility, which in past downswings were associated with a smaller drop in output growth, have also
increased in most commodity exporters.
29For the sample of net exporters that experienced at least two
upswings in our data sample—one in the 2000s and at least one in
the 1960–99 period—the cumulative net terms-of-trade increase
averaged slightly more than 70 percent in the 2000s, compared
with 50 percent in past episodes. When all net exporters—not only
those that recorded a pre-2000s upswing—are included, the average
cumulative increase in the commodity terms of trade in the 2000s
was even sharper, about 140 percent.

Upswings and Downswings: The Role of Policy Frameworks

Note: The bars (blocks) show the difference between the average (median) growth
rates during upswings and subsequent downswings. The exchange rate regime
classiﬁcation is based on Reinhart and Rogoff 2004. See Annex 2.3 for details. An
episode is classiﬁed as having high ﬁscal policy procyclicality if the correlation
between real government spending growth and the change in the smoothed net
commodity terms of trade during the cycle is higher than the overall sample
median (and having low ﬁscal policy procyclicality otherwise). A country is
classiﬁed as having a high credit-to-GDP ratio if credit to the private sector (as a
share of GDP) during the upswing is higher than the sample median (and having a
low credit-to-GDP ratio otherwise).

Commodity exporters are entering the current
downswing with stronger external positions as well.
The median annual current account balance and the
average annual change in the net foreign asset position were 5 percentage points of GDP stronger in the
2000s upswings than earlier.
In sum, the larger increase in commodity prices in
the 2000s could potentially presage sharper termsof-trade downswings for some commodity exporters
(beyond the decline already experienced) and therefore lead to sharper reductions in actual and potential
growth. At the same time, stronger external positions,
more robust policy frameworks, and more developed
financial markets could help mitigate some of the
growth impacts.

Regression Analysis
This subsection examines the responses of key
macroeconomic variables to changes in the terms of
trade.30 The estimations control for global time effects
and partner country GDP growth, as well as political
regime change and conflict.
The estimation results suggest that terms-of-trade
shocks have positive, statistically significant, and
fairly long-lasting effects on output (Figure 2.11). A
10 percentage point increase in a country’s commodity
terms of trade is found to lead to a slightly more than
1 percentage point increase in GDP after three years.
The effect gradually subsides, but remains statistically
significant, over a horizon of up to five years. The
estimates suggest that the effects of negative shocks
are somewhat larger and more persistent than those
of positive shocks. Nonetheless, the analysis cannot
statistically reject the possibility that output responds
symmetrically to positive and negative changes in the
commodity terms of trade.
Turning to the spending side, both consumption
and investment respond positively and with statistical
significance to commodity terms-of-trade shocks over
a seven-year period. The average response of total fixed
investment is almost double that of consumption. The
positive response of public investment is more immediate and long lasting than that of private investment.
On the production side, shocks to the commodity terms of trade raise capital accumulation over the
medium term in line with the estimated persistent
response of investment. The capital stock increases (or
decreases) steadily for seven years after the shock by a
cumulative 1 percentage point. In contrast, the impacts
on labor supply and TFP are muted. The response
of employment is not statistically significant. The
impact on TFP is only weakly significant in the first
two years after the shock, which could reflect a cyclical deterioration in the Solow residual relative to its
underlying trend, as seen in the event studies. Overall,
these results are consistent with the event study findings, which suggest that commodity terms-of-trade
shocks affect potential output mainly by raising capital
accumulation.31
30The analysis uses the local projection estimation method
proposed in Jordà 2005. This method does not impose the dynamic
restrictions embedded in vector autoregression specifications and is
therefore suited to estimating nonlinearities in the dynamic response.
Annex 2.4 provides details of the estimation methodology.
31The estimation does not distinguish between supply-driven and
demand-driven changes in the commodity terms of trade. Chapter 3

CHAPTER 2

WHERE ARE COMMODIT Y EXPORTERS HEADED? OUTPUT GROWTH IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE COMMODITY BOOM

The response of output to terms-of-trade shocks is
stronger among low-income developing countries than
in emerging market economies (Figure 2.12). Termsof-trade shocks are estimated to have a more rapid
effect on growth in countries specializing in extractive
commodities. In contrast, they take longer to build
but appear more persistent for countries specializing in
nonextractive commodities. Given the smaller sample
and more varied responses, the estimates for the latter
group are not statistically significant.
What do the estimated responses of output growth
to the commodity terms of trade imply for the growth
outlook for commodity exporters? To answer this question, projections for the country-specific commodity
terms-of-trade indices through 2020 were constructed
using the forecasts for international commodity
prices.32
On average, the weaker outlook for commodity
prices implies that the annual growth of output for net
commodity exporters will decline further, by almost 1
percentage point in 2015–17 compared with 2012–14.
The results differ sizably among the different types
of commodity exporters. Most notably, reflecting a
relatively larger decline for energy prices, the reduction
in growth for energy exporters is projected to be about
2¼ percentage points over the same period.33 The
effect of commodity prices on capital accumulation
implies a reduction in the growth of potential output
as well. Based on the estimated response of capital
accumulation to the commodity terms of trade, the
projected decline in the growth of potential output in
2015–17 compared with 2012–14 is about ⅓ percentage point on average and ⅔ percentage point for
energy exporters.

Sectoral Reallocation during
Commodity Booms: Case Studies
Theoretical studies predict that the composition
of economic activity will change following a boom
of the April 2012 World Economic Outlook finds the output responses
to demand-driven commodity price shocks to be somewhat larger
than the responses to supply-driven shocks, but with no statistically
significant difference.
32Output projections for all the countries in the sample were then
generated, feeding the relevant historical data and the forecasts for
the terms of trade into the impulse response functions for output
under the main specification.
33These projections assume that all other factors are unchanged
and therefore are not equivalent to regular World Economic Outlook
forecasts, which take other factors into account.

Figure 2.11. Macroeconomic Variables in the Aftermath of
Commodity Terms-of-Trade Shocks
(Percentage points; years on x-axis)

Terms-of-trade shocks have positive, fairly long-lasting, and symmetric effects on
output. Consumption and investment respond positively to an increase in the terms
of trade. On the production side, capital accumulation rises, whereas the responses
of labor supply and total factor productivity are muted.

make them challenging to examine for a large set of
countries.
This section uses data from the Latin America
KLEMS and World KLEMS data sets to examine patterns of sectoral reallocation and their implications for
aggregate TFP growth in three commodity exporters
with well-established macroeconomic policy frameworks—Australia, Canada, and Chile—during the
commodity boom of the 2000s.35 The analysis seeks to
answer the following questions:
•• How did the growth rates of sectoral capital and labor
stocks change during the boom period (2000–10)
relative to the preboom period (1990–99)? Which
sectors contributed the most to changes in the growth
rates of aggregate investment and employment?
•• Were the shifts in the relative shares of nontradables
and manufacturing in economy-wide output and
factor stocks different from those in commodity
importers over the same period?
•• Did the reallocation of output across sectors during
the boom have an effect on the growth rate of TFP?

Background

1

The surge in global commodity prices in the first
decade of the 2000s led to commodity terms-of-trade
gains for Australia, Canada, and Chile given their
relatively large extractive industries: coal and iron ore
in Australia, oil and natural gas in Canada, and copper
in Chile. Among these three countries, the relative
share of the commodity sector is largest in Chile,
closely followed by Australia, and is the smallest in
Canada (Table 2.1). Australia and Chile enjoyed larger

in the commodity terms of trade, with a reallocation
of output and factors from the manufacturing sector
toward the commodity and nontradables sectors.34
These predictions of the Dutch disease effect are also
borne out in the model simulations presented earlier
in this chapter. The sectoral reallocation could shift the
share of sectors in overall output; to the extent that
TFP levels and growth rates differ across sectors, the
change in sectoral shares could affect the economy’s
overall TFP growth rate. The sectoral reallocation
patterns are thus relevant to country growth prospects
in the aftermath of the boom, but data constraints

surpassing the change in savings as a share of GDP.

Did Capital and Labor Reallocate toward the Commodity
and Nontradables Sectors?
In all three countries, there was a clear pickup in the
growth rates of both capital and labor in the extractive
sector during the boom period.36 Higher investment
in the sector accounted for the bulk of the increase in
economy-wide investment in Australia and Chile. But
the broader changes in investment and employment
growth across the commodity, manufacturing, and
nontradables sectors did not always conform to the
model-based predictions. Contrary to those predictions, in Australia the pace of capital accumulation
in manufacturing picked up during the boom period,
reflecting in part strong demand from export markets
(mainly east Asia), while it declined in the nontradables sector.37 In Chile, manufacturing employment
growth increased during the boom, while capital accumulation slowed in nontradables. Canada is the only
case among the three countries in which the sectoral
factor accumulation patterns consistently favored the
extractive and nontradables sectors: both the pace of
capital accumulation and employment levels fell in
the Canadian manufacturing sector during the boom,
while those in the extractive and nontradables sectors
increased (Figure 2.14).

Indicators in Australia, Canada, and Chile
Australia, Canada, and Chile experienced commodity terms-of-trade booms in the
ﬁrst decade of the 2000s. In that period, the three countries differed in the extent
of their real currency appreciation, but in all three, real incomes grew faster than
real output, and investment picked up strongly.

analyze sectoral shifts arising from the commodity boom,

37In the 2000s, manufacturing exports to east Asia accounted for
more than one-third of total manufacturing exports in Australia,
about 15 percent in Chile, and about 5 percent in Canada.

Figure 2.14. Growth of Capital and Labor by Sector: Boom
versus Preboom Periods
(Average annual percent change)

In Australia, Canada, and Chile, the 2000–10 commodity boom period coincided
with a clear increase in both capital and labor in the extractive sector; in Australia
and Chile, that sector accounted for the bulk of economy-wide capital
accumulation in the period. Labor and capital in the three countries did not shift
notably into the nontradables sector.

the commodity-exporting economies; many advanced
economies have experienced a similar shift during the
past three decades. Thus, to draw definitive conclusions
on whether the boom of the 2000s accelerated the
reallocation of activity toward nontradables in commodity exporters, it is useful to examine whether the
shift was stronger than in commodity importers. The
data indeed suggest that the three commodity exporters considered here saw a faster reallocation of output
shares toward nontradables during the boom relative to
importers (Figure 2.15, panel 1). But only in Canada
did this represent a change relative to the preboom
years; in Australia and Chile, the faster reallocation
toward nontradables represented a continuation of a
preexisting trend. Data on factors of production paint
an even more mixed picture: only in the case of labor
in Canada is there a steepening in the trend relative to
importers during the boom period (Figure 2.15, panels
2 and 3). In sum, benchmarking against the experience of commodity importers suggests little evidence
of a faster shift from manufacturing toward nontradables activities during the boom among the three
countries studied, except in Canada. The evolution of
house prices offers a slightly different view: in all three
countries, especially Canada, real house prices rose
faster than the average real house price in commodity
importers, providing some evidence of relative strength
in nontradables activities during the boom period
(Figure 2.15, panel 4).
The different patterns of sectoral reallocation across
the three countries can be attributed in part to the
destination of their export manufacturing products.
Among the countries, Australia—which saw a pickup in
manufacturing investment during the boom period—
sent a relatively larger share of its manufacturing exports
to east Asia, particularly China, on the eve of the boom.
In contrast, the majority of Canada’s manufacturing
exports went to the United States, where manufacturing
output growth slowed in the 2000s. As highlighted in
Box 2.1, to the extent that booms in commodity prices
coincide with strong global activity, Dutch disease effects
in commodity exporters could be offset, especially if the
manufacturing sector has trade linkages with the fastergrowing regions.

Did the Reallocation of Activity Hamper Aggregate TFP
Growth?
The evidence on sectoral growth rates of output,
capital, and labor points to unambiguous shifts toward

CHAPTER 2

the commodity sector as well as shifts—though not as
consistent—toward nontradables activities. To examine
whether these changes had an impact on economywide TFP growth, the latter is decomposed into
within-sector and between-sector effects, applying the
decomposition in Dabla-Norris and others 2015.38
Data from Latin America KLEMS and World
KLEMS indicate that aggregate TFP growth declined
in all three case study countries during the commodity
boom relative to the previous decade and even turned
negative in Australia and Chile. The decomposition
indicates that this decline was entirely due to the
within-sector effect (Figure 2.16, panels 1, 3, and 5).
The between-sector effect in fact attenuated the decline
in TFP. This finding of a negative contribution from
the within-sector effect holds more broadly for Latin
American economies (Aravena and others 2014; Hofman and others 2015).
Declining TFP growth in extractive industries and
manufacturing appears to be a common factor behind
the weak within-sector TFP performance in all three
cases (Figure 2.16, panels 2, 4, and 6). A marked
decline in TFP growth in nontradables was also a key
driver in Australia and Chile. The weak TFP growth
in the extractive sectors during the boom is likely to
have resulted from the time-to-build associated with
large-scale mining investments and the tapping of less
efficient mines (Figure 2.17) (see Francis 2008). The
remoteness of extractive production sites may have
contributed to higher marginal costs in the supporting
nontradables service industries.
In summary, the case studies point to substantial
heterogeneity across countries in terms of sectoral
reallocation patterns during commodity booms. While
all three countries under study experienced a flow of
factors of production into the commodity sector, they
experienced varying degrees of reallocation between the
manufacturing and nontradables sectors. The fact that
the countries were exposed to different manufacturing
export destinations (that were experiencing different
38The

decomposition is based on the following specification:

tfpt – tfpt–1 = ∑i ωi,t–1(tfpi,t – tfpi,t–1) + ∑i tfpi,t(ωi,t – ωi,t–1),
in which i refers to the sectors of the economy (here, extractive
commodities, manufacturing, and nontradables); tfpt and tfpi,t refer
to economy-wide and sectoral TFP, respectively; and ωi,t is the share
of real value added of sector i. The first term on the right side is
the within-sector effect given by the weighted sum of TFP growth
in each sector. The second term is the between-sector effect, which
captures the effect of the sectoral reallocation of real value added on
aggregate TFP growth.

Manufacturing, Commodity Exporters Relative to Commodity

In Australia and Chile, the 2000–10 commodity boom did not accelerate the shift
of output, capital, and labor shares from manufacturing into nontradables. House
prices, however, grew more strongly in Australia, Canada, and Chile than in their
commodity-importing peers.

indicates that the reallocation from manufacturing to nontradables in commodity
exporters intensiﬁed relative to that in importers during the commodity boom.

rates of expansion) seems to have been a factor behind
the varying intensity of sectoral reallocation; countries
with trading linkages to faster-growing countries had
more limited Dutch disease symptoms. Decompositions of economy-wide TFP growth do not suggest
that sectoral reallocation hindered TFP growth during
the commodity boom of the 2000s but instead point
to a marked decline in productivity growth within sectors. Understanding the mechanisms behind the drop
in TFP growth in these economies is an important area
for future research.39

Conclusions
The evidence presented in this chapter suggests
that fluctuations in international commodity prices,
through their impact on domestic spending, can lead
to sizable output fluctuations in commodity exporters. In exporters of energy and metals, the comovement between output and the commodity terms of
trade tends to be particularly strong. It is also stronger
in countries with lower levels of financial develop39Studies of this issue include Parham 2012 for Australia and

ment, more procyclical fiscal policies, and less flexible
exchange rates.
The strong investment response to changes in the
commodity terms of trade means that the latter affect
not only actual output, but also potential output. As a
result, the growth of potential output can be expected
to decline during downswings in commodity prices.
The change in the cyclical component of output is,
however, about twice the size of the change in potential output, the structural component.
Against the backdrop of the recent declines in the
commodity prices, the findings of this chapter suggest
that the growth slowdown in commodity exporters
mirrors experiences during earlier downswings. The
slowdown could even be larger than those experienced
in past episodes, since the terms-of-trade upswings
that many exporters experienced in the first decade
of the 2000s were much larger than earlier ones. As a
result, they may have led to much larger increases in
actual and potential output growth than in the past
upswings analyzed in the chapter. If the terms-of-trade
downswings are now also larger, the declines in growth
would likely be correspondingly larger as well.
The chapter’s regression-based analysis indeed
suggests that the recent commodity price declines,
together with the weak commodity price outlook,
could subtract about 1 percentage point on average from the growth rate of commodity exporters in
2015–17 relative to 2012–14. For energy exporters,
the reduction in growth could be even larger—about
2¼ percentage points on average. The projected drag
on the growth of potential output is about ⅓ percentage point on average for commodity exporters and ⅔
percentage point on average for energy exporters.
At the same time, many commodity exporters have
moved toward policy frameworks and structural characteristics that are more conducive to smoothing the
macroeconomic effects of terms-of-trade fluctuations—
less procyclical fiscal policies, more flexible exchange
rates, and deeper financial systems. These changes
could mitigate some of the growth impact of commodity price downswings.
The analysis in the chapter suggests that policymakers must avoid overestimating output gaps and the
scope for expansionary macroeconomic policies to support demand. As commodity-exporting economies are
likely to overheat toward the end of a prolonged surge
in commodity prices, the growth slowdown in the
immediate aftermath of the boom most likely reflects a
cooling of output toward potential, which may itself be

growing at a reduced pace, given a slowdown in investment. If indicators of slack show few signs of output
having fallen below potential, expansionary monetary
and fiscal policies are more likely to raise inflation than
to sustainably raise investment and employment.
In countries where output has fallen below potential, supportive domestic demand policies could help
avoid a costly underutilization of resources. But two
considerations suggest that the drop in the commodity terms of trade may itself limit the scope to ease
macroeconomic policies. First, in economies with some
exchange rate flexibility, currency depreciation may
have led to an easing of monetary conditions without
a change in the stance of monetary policy; thus, any
easing in the stance could risk further depreciation and
unwelcome increases in inflation. In other economies,
declining resource-based fiscal revenues may call for
fiscal adjustment to secure debt sustainability. As also
emphasized in Chapter 1 of the October 2015 Fiscal
Monitor, these trade-offs highlight the need, during
upswings, to build fiscal buffers that will help support
the economy during downswings.
Although the comovement of potential output
with the commodity terms of trade tends to be less
pronounced than that of actual output, the analysis in
this chapter suggests that declining growth of potential output exacerbates the postboom slowdowns. The
challenge for policymakers in commodity exporters,
therefore, is to implement targeted structural reforms
to alleviate the most binding supply-side bottlenecks
and restore stronger growth potential.

in which xi,j,t–1 (mi,j,t–1) denote the average export
(import) value of commodity j by country i between
t – 1 and t – 5 (in U.S. dollars). This average value
of net exports is divided by total commodity trade
(exports plus imports of all commodities).
The commodity price series start in 1960. Prices
of 41 commodities are used, sorted into four broad
categories:
1. Energy: coal, crude oil, and natural gas
2. Metals: aluminum, copper, iron ore, lead, nickel,
tin, and zinc
3. Food: bananas, barley, beef, cocoa, coconut oil,
coffee, corn, fish, fish meal, groundnuts, lamb,
oranges, palm oil, poultry, rice, shrimp, soybean
meal, soybean oil, soybeans, sugar, sunflower oil,
tea, and wheat
4. Raw materials: cotton, hardwood logs and sawn
wood, hides, rubber, softwood logs and sawn wood,
soybean meal, and wool

The price of crude oil is the simple average of three
spot prices: Dated Brent, West Texas Intermediate,
and Dubai Fateh. The World Bank’s Global Economic Monitor database has been used to extend
the price series of barley, iron ore, and natural gas
from the IMF’s Primary Commodity Price System
back to 1960. The price of coal is the Australian
coal price, extended back to 1960 using the World
Bank’s Global Economic Monitor database and U.S.
coal price data from the U.S. Energy Information
Administration.
Forecasts of the country-specific commodity terms
of trade are constructed in the same manner, using the
prices of commodities futures for the 41 commodities,
where available, through 2020.

Commodity-Exporting Country Groupings
A country is classified as a commodity exporter if it
meets the following two conditions:
•• Commodities constituted at least 35 percent of the
country’s total exports, on average, between 1962
and 2014.
•• Net commodity exports accounted for at least 5
percent of its gross trade (exports plus imports), on
average, between 1962 and 2014.
Among emerging market and developing economies,
52 satisfy these criteria, 20 of which are low-income
developing countries (according to the classification in
the World Economic Outlook’s Statistical Appendix). For
a list of the 52 economies and their shares of commodity exports, see Annex Table 2.1.2.

Annex 2.2. Methodology for Dating
Commodity Price Cycles
Cycles in country-specific commodity terms-oftrade indices are identified using the Bry-Boschan
Quarterly algorithm, which is standard in the business cycle literature (Harding and Pagan 2002). The
algorithm as used here differs from the standard
version in two ways: (1) it is applied to a smoothed
(five-year centered moving-average) version of the
price index because the underlying series are choppy,
making it difficult for standard algorithms to identify
meaningful cycles, and (2) it allows for asymmetry
between upswings and downswings, as the focus here
is on cycles in which the upswing was at least five
years long, even if the subsequent downswing was
sudden.
The algorithm identifies 115 cycles since 1960
(78 with peaks before 2000 and 37 with peaks after

2000). There are approximately two cycles a country.
Upswings are slightly longer than downswings, with a
mean (median) of seven (six) years for upswings and
six (five) years for downswings (Annex Figure 2.2.1,
panel 1). The duration of phases and the amplitude of
price movements are correlated (Annex Figure 2.2.1,
panels 3 and 4). Most peaks were in the 1980s and the
most recent years, particularly for extractive commodities (Annex Figure 2.2.1, panel 2).
Upswings are defined trough to peak (excluding the
trough year, but including the peak year); downswings
are defined peak to trough (excluding the peak year,
but including the trough year).

Note: Countries listed are those for which gross commodity exports as a share of total exports were greater than 35 percent and net commodity exports as a share of
total trade (exports plus imports) were greater than 5 percent, on average, between 1962 and 2014. Commodity intensities are determined using a breakdown of the first
criterion into the four main commodity categories: energy, food, metals, and raw materials.

•• Growth rates: Average growth rates over upswings
(downswings) are computed by first averaging for a
given country over all upswing (downswing) years,
then taking simple averages of these across countries.
Samples are fully balanced, that is, they include the
same country cycles for upswings and downswings.
•• Exchange rate regimes: Exchange rate regimes are
categorized as fixed or flexible according to the classification set out by Reinhart and Rogoff (2004).
Regimes of countries in their coarse categories 1 and
2 are classified as fixed, and those in their coarse categories 3 and 4 are categorized as flexible. Countries
in categories 1 and 2 have no separate legal tender
or variously use currency boards, pegs, horizontal
bands, crawling pegs, and narrow crawling bands.
Countries in categories 3 and 4 variously have
wider crawling bands, moving bands, and managed
floating or freely floating arrangements. As very few

countries maintain the same regime over an entire
cycle, the exchange rate regime in the peak year is
used to classify the cycle. The sample includes 34
cycles with fixed exchange rates but only 8 cycles
with flexible exchange rates. Regimes classified as
free-falling are dropped.
•• Type of fiscal policy: Cycles are classified as being
subject to either a high or low degree of fiscal policy
procyclicality. The classification depends on whether
the correlation between real spending growth and
the change in the smoothed commodity terms-oftrade series is above or below the median for the
overall sample during the cycle.
•• Cycles and credit ratio: Cycles are classified as having
a high (low) ratio of credit to GDP depending on
whether average domestic credit to the private sector as a share of GDP during the upswing is above
(below) the sample median.

Among the commodity-exporting countries, emerging
market economies can be differentiated from lowincome developing countries along four key dimensions:
commodity intensity, exchange rate regime, credit ratio,
and fiscal procyclicality (Annex Figure 2.3.1). Emerging markets tend to have a greater degree of commodity
intensity (GDP share of gross commodity exports). A
greater share of low-income developing countries operate fixed exchange rates. Emerging markets tend to have
greater financial depth, as captured by higher credit-toGDP ratios. And emerging markets tend to have a more
procyclical fiscal stance.
The comovement between the commodity termsof-trade cycle and investment (and hence capital) is
particularly marked in extractive commodity exporters
(Annex Figure 2.3.2, panels 1 and 2), in line with the
longer, more pronounced cycles in their terms of trade.

CHAPTER 2

WHERE ARE COMMODIT Y EXPORTERS HEADED? OUTPUT GROWTH IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE COMMODITY BOOM

As extractive commodity exporters represent almost
three-fourths of the emerging market economies in
the sample, but less than half of low-income developing countries, differences across commodity types thus
also translate into distinctions across country groups
(Annex Figure 2.3.2, panels 3 and 4). GDP, spending,
and production factors as well as trend GDP are less
procyclical (or even countercyclical) in low-income
developing countries.

Annex 2.4. Local Projection Method
Methodology and Data
The estimations of baseline impulse responses
presented in the chapter follow the local projection
method proposed by Jordà (2005) and developed
further by Teulings and Zubanov (2014). This method
provides a flexible alternative to traditional vector
autoregression techniques and is robust to misspecification of the data-generating process. Local projections
use separate horizon-specific regressions of the variable
of interest (for example, output, investment, capital)
on the shock variable and a series of control variables.
The sequence of coefficient estimates for the various
horizons provides a nonparametric estimate of the
impulse response function.
The estimated baseline specification is as follows:
yi,t+h – yi,t–1 = αih + gth + b1h ∆si,t + ∑pj=1 β2h ∆si,t–j
+ ∑jh–=11 β3h ∆si,t+h–j + ∑pj=1 θ1h ∆yi,t–j
h
1 h
+ ∑pj=0 θ2h xi,t–j + ∑h–
j=1 θ3 xi,t+h–j + ε i,t ,

in which the i subscripts index countries; the t subscripts index years; the h superscripts index the horizon of the projection after time t; p is the number of
lags for each variable; yi,t is the natural logarithm of
the variable of interest (for example, output); and si,t
is the natural logarithm of the commodity terms of
trade, the shock variable of interest. The equation also
includes controls for additional factors, xi,t , such as
the trade-weighted output growth of trading partners, political regime transition, and conflict in the
domestic economy. Regressions include country fixed
effects, aih, and time fixed effects, gth.
A balanced panel for the period 1960–2007 is used
for the baseline regression (Annex Table 2.4.1). The
period of the global financial crisis and its aftermath is
thus omitted. However, because of differences in data
availability, the number of economies included differs

by variable. For example, for real GDP, the sample
spans 32 commodity-exporting emerging market and
developing economies (Annex Table 2.4.2). However,
the results are robust to the minimum sample of
economies available for total factor productivity.

Robustness Tests
The chapter’s baseline regression analysis focuses on
the macroeconomic impact of terms-of-trade shocks
and thus excludes economies for which data are not
available until the 1970s. Repeating the analysis using
data starting a decade later, in 1970, brings in 13
additional commodity exporters, including the oil

92

International Monetary Fund | October 2015

exporters of the Gulf region (Kuwait, Oman, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates). The findings
are broadly robust to the addition of these economies. Furthermore, starting the estimation from 1980
(thereby omitting the 1970s oil shocks) marginally
boosts the GDP response in the outer years.
In addition, investment and consumption respond
more strongly and with greater persistence to shocks
that occur during a persistent commodity terms-of-trade
cycle than to other shocks. This is consistent with the
idea that successive commodity terms-of-trade gains
can generate perceptions of a more persistent income
windfall and therefore boost the incentive to invest (and
consume), which in turn supports aggregate activity.

CHAPTER 2

WHERE ARE COMMODIT Y EXPORTERS HEADED? OUTPUT GROWTH IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE COMMODITY BOOM

Box 2.1. The Not-So-Sick Patient: Commodity Booms and the Dutch Disease Phenomenon
In the “Dutch disease” phenomenon, a boom in
the commodity-producing sector of an economy puts
downward pressure on the output of the (noncommodity) tradable goods sector—essentially manufacturing. An extensive theoretical literature, starting with
Corden 1981 and Corden and Neary 1982, examines
the patterns and optimality of factor reallocation
between sectors following booms in commodity production (linked to the discovery of natural resources).
The models presented in these studies predict that an
improvement in the commodity terms of trade and
the subsequent spending of the income windfall in
the domestic economy will drive up the real exchange
rate and divert capital and labor from manufacturing
toward the commodity and nontradables sectors.1
Despite some evidence of a positive association
between the terms of trade and the real exchange
rate of commodity exporters, empirical research on
whether commodity booms hinder manufacturing
performance has been mixed, even among studies that
focus on the same countries or similar episodes:2
• No Dutch disease effects found: Studies of the 1970s
oil price boom, such as Gelb and Associates 1988
and Spatafora and Warner 1995, estimate that
higher oil prices led to real exchange rate appreciations but had no adverse effect on manufacturing
output in oil-exporting economies. Sala-i-Martin
and Subramanian (2003) find both the real
exchange rate and manufacturing activity to be
insensitive to oil price movements in Nigeria, an oil
exporter. Bjørnland (1998) argues that evidence of
Dutch disease following the United Kingdom’s oil
boom is weak and that manufacturing output in
Norway actually benefited from oil discoveries and
higher oil prices.
The authors of this box are Aqib Aslam and Zsóka Kóczán.
1There are two effects at work: a “resource movement” effect,
in which the favorable price shock in the commodity sector
draws factors of production out of other activities, and a “spending effect,” which draws factors of production out of tradables
(to be substituted with imports) into the nontradables sector.
2For instance, Chen and Rogoff (2003) show that the currencies of three advanced economy commodity exporters—Australia,
Canada, and New Zealand—have comoved strongly with their
terms of trade. Cashin, Céspedes, and Sahay (2004) find a longrun relationship between the real exchange rates and commodity terms-of-trade indices in about one-third of a sample of 58
commodity exporters. Arezki and Ismail (2013) argue that delays
in the response of nontradables-intensive government spending
to declines in commodity prices could weaken the empirical correlation between the latter and the real exchange rate.

• Support for Dutch disease effects: Studies that have
found support for Dutch disease effects are more
recent. Ismail (2010) uses disaggregated data for
manufacturing subsectors for a sample of oil exporters
for the 1977–2004 period and shows that manufacturing output was negatively associated with the oil
price, especially in subsectors with a relatively higher
degree of labor intensity in production. Harding and
Venables (2013) use balance of payments data for a
broad sample of commodity exporters for 1970–2006
and find that an increase of $1 in commodity exports
tends to be accompanied by a fall of about 75 cents
in noncommodity exports and an increase of almost
25 cents in noncommodity imports.
Some indirect evidence of the Dutch disease effect
can be gleaned by looking at the evolution of country
shares in global manufacturing exports, which tend
to be lower on average for commodity exporters than
for other emerging market and developing economies.
Although both groups have increased their market
shares over time (relative to advanced economies),
commodity exporters have seen a smaller increase in
their global manufacturing export shares than the
others, and the gap between the average market shares
of the two groups has widened since the early 1990s
(Figure 2.1.1, panel 1).
Formal tests of whether terms-of-trade booms
hurt manufacturing export performance yield varied
results, however. The real exchange rate appreciates
gradually following an increase in the commodity
terms of trade (with the increase becoming statistically
significant only after the fifth year), but the impact
on manufacturing exports is not significant, which
points to a wide range of experiences across episodes
(Figure 2.1.1, panels 2 and 3).
Numerous explanations have been offered for the
absence of major Dutch disease symptoms following commodity terms-of-trade booms. These include
policy-induced production restraints in the oil sector
(especially in the 1970s), the “enclave nature” of
the commodity sector (that is, its limited participation in domestic factor markets), limited spending of
the windfall on nontradables (with a ramping up of
imports instead), and government protection of the
manufacturing sector.3
A further explanation could be linked to the pickup
in global economic activity that, in some episodes,

could be contributing to the booms in world commodity prices. Stronger global activity could lead to
stronger foreign demand for manufactured goods in all
countries, commodity exporters included, and provide
some offset to the loss of competitiveness associated
with an appreciating real exchange rate. This explanation seems consistent with the varying findings in the
empirical literature. Dutch disease symptoms appear
to be stronger in studies that examine the performance
of the manufacturing sector over longer time periods,
which would include episodes of resource discoveries
and consequent increases in commodity production
volumes. Such country-specific episodes would not
necessarily be expected to coincide with episodes of
strong growth in global demand.
A question that has received much attention
among policymakers is whether commodity boom
effects on the manufacturing sector weigh on longerterm growth. In principle, commodity booms could
compromise the longer-term outlook for the economy
if they weaken features of the manufacturing sector
that support longer-term growth—such as increasing returns to scale, learning by doing, and positive
technological externalities.4 However, the evidence
is inconclusive.5 One explanation for the lack of an
apparent correlation between Dutch disease symptoms
and longer-term growth could be that learning-bydoing externalities are not necessarily exclusive to manufacturing; the commodity sectors could also benefit
from that effect (Frankel 2012). Another explanation
proposes that a manufacturing sector that contracts
and shifts toward greater capital intensity as a result of
a commodity boom—and that, in turn, uses higherskilled labor—may generate more positive externalities
for the economy than a larger manufacturing sector
using low-skilled labor (Ismail 2010).

4Theoretical models that incorporate learning-by-doing
externalities in the manufacturing sector include Matsuyama
1992, van Wijnbergen 1984a, Krugman 1987, and Benigno
and Fornaro 2014. Rodrik (2015) also argues that premature
deindustrialization can reduce the economic growth potential of
developing economies by stifling the formal manufacturing sector, which tends to be the most technologically dynamic sector.
5A comprehensive survey of the literature on this topic is in
Magud and Sosa 2013. Rodrik (2008) analyzes the effect of the
real exchange rate on economic growth and the channels through
which this link operates; he concludes that episodes of undervaluation are associated with more rapid economic growth. Eichengreen
(2008), however, notes that the evidence of a positive growth effect
from a competitive real exchange rate is not overwhelming.

CHAPTER 2

WHERE ARE COMMODIT Y EXPORTERS HEADED? OUTPUT GROWTH IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE COMMODITY BOOM

Box 2.2. Commodity Booms and Public Investment
A commodity resource windfall can support
economic development in low-income developing
countries where potential returns to public investment
are high and access to international and domestic
credit markets is limited. When managed well, investments in productivity-enhancing public capital, such
as infrastructure, can help raise output and living
standards over the long term (Collier and others 2010;
IMF 2012, 2015).1
A model calibrated to a low-income developing
country is presented here to illustrate how a commodity windfall can raise public investment and
boost income levels over the long term if capital is
scarce and credit is constrained.2 The model captures
the key trade-offs in public investment decisions.3 In
particular, public investment in low-income developing countries has the potential for high returns
but exhibits low levels of efficiency.4 The long-term
effects of the boom on the growth of output depend
on the rate of return of public capital (relative to the
cost of funding), the efficiency of public investment,
and the response of private investment to the increase
in public capital.
The analysis examines the behavior of nonresource
GDP in two scenarios—“no scaling up” (the baseThe authors of this box are Rudolfs Bems and Bin Grace Li.
1For example, public investment can help close infrastructure
gaps, which are an important impediment to trade integration
and total factor productivity catch-up (see Chapter 3 of the April
2015 Regional Economic Outlook: Sub-Saharan Africa).
2Berg and others (forthcoming) find that low levels of efficiency may be correlated with high rates of return because the
low efficiency implies very scarce public capital. In this situation,
the rate of return to investment spending may not depend on
the level of efficiency. Increasing efficiency would nonetheless
increase the return to public investment spending.
3The model extends the work of Berg and others (2013) and
Melina, Yang, and Zanna (2014). A detailed presentation of the
model calibration is provided by Gupta, Li, and Yu (2015). The
modeled economy features the same structure as the commodity
exporter in the IMF’s Global Economy Model (GEM) used in
the chapter, including three sectors: tradables, nontradables, and
commodities. However, it excludes some of the real and nominal
frictions featured in the GEM, which makes it more suitable
for studying long-term effects rather than fluctuations over the
commodity cycle. The calibration of the model pays particular
attention to the lower levels of public investment efficiency and
limited absorptive capacity in low-income countries.
4Albino-War and others 2014 and IMF 2015 discuss the definition and measurement of public investment efficiency. These
papers also highlight possible reforms that could help make
public investments more efficient, such as steps to strengthen
project appraisal, selection, and budget planning.

line) and “invest as you go”—both of which feature
a 20 percent increase in commodity prices followed by
a 15 percent drop after year 10 (consistent with the
scenario discussed in the chapter) (Figure 2.2.1):
• No scaling up: In the baseline case, the public investment ratio stays constant at 6 percent of GDP.
• Invest as you go: In the alternative scenario, all
royalties from the commodity boom are spent on
public investment, whose share of GDP increases
1 percentage point, to 7 percent, during the boom
(the initial 10 years) and subsequently falls in
tandem with the commodity price. Nevertheless,
it stays elevated in the long term in line with the
permanent gain in the commodity price.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: ADJUSTING TO LOWER COMMODITY PRICES

Box 2.2 (continued)
As in the model simulation shown in the chapter’s
second section, nonresource GDP increases by 0.5 percent over the long term if the government maintains
an unchanged investment ratio. Under invest as you
go, the additional public investment increases longterm nonresource output by about 2 percent because
of the direct impact of a higher stock of public capital
and the crowding-in of private investment.5 The
magnitude of this positive impact on output is broadly
consistent with the empirical findings for developing
economies in Chapter 3 of the October 2014 World
Economic Outlook.
The gains from higher public investment in lowincome developing countries depend crucially on
efficiency levels, which vary across the two scenarios
5While the increase in the long-term output under this
alternative scenario might appear small, it should be considered
against the relatively small size of the increase in public investment (1 percent of GDP at the peak). In comparison, Chapter
3 of the October 2014 World Economic Outlook finds that in a
typical public investment boom, the increase is about 7 percentage points of GDP. However, a large scaling up of public investment may also result in the implementation of inframarginal
projects, lowering its impact (see Warner 2014).

96

International Monetary Fund | October 2015

(Figure 2.2.1). In the baseline case, 35 percent of
public investment is lost. In the alternative scenario,
the ramping up of public investment reduces the
efficiency level by about 6 percentage points—about
41 percent is lost. The decline in efficiency in the
scenario highlights the trade-off between the need for
public investment and investment efficiency, with the
latter calibrated to match levels reported in empirical
studies.6
In sum, a ramping up of public investment in
response to a commodity boom can bring long-term
benefits to commodity exporters. But considering
the limited absorptive capacity of many developing
economies, a more gradual investment profile can yield
higher efficiency levels and lead to more favorable
long-term outcomes. The more gradual pace can also
curb the demand pressures during the boom phase of
the commodity cycle.
6These levels are consistent with the cost overruns in lowincome developing countries in Africa, as reported by development agencies (see Foster and Briceño-Garmendia 2010). Gupta
and others (2014) document the decrease in public investment
efficiency during the 2000–08 boom.

Box 2.3. Getting By with a Little Help from a Boom: Do Commodity Windfalls Speed Up Human Development?
Improvements in education and health help a country increase its economic potential over time by building larger and more-skilled pools of human capital.
Increasing their investments in human development
is therefore one way in which commodity-exporting
emerging market and developing economies can use
commodity windfall gains to boost their longer-term
living standards. The following discussion considers
whether commodity exporters have had an advantage
in boosting human development.1

Does Being a Commodity Exporter Matter for
Human Development?
To set the stage, it is useful to investigate whether
being a commodity exporter matters for the level and
pace of improvement in human development. Examination of the average levels of key human development
indicators over the past five decades reveals no clear
pattern across exporters and others (Figure 2.3.1).2 For
instance, in terms of educational attainment at the secondary school level, commodity-exporting low-income
developing countries have on average had better outcomes than noncommodity exporters, while commodityexporting emerging market economies on average have
had poorer outcomes than their noncommodity-exporting peers. For life expectancy and infant mortality, levels
of indicators have been similar across the two different
types of economies, but the relative pace of improvement
has varied between the groups over time.
Controlling for basic country characteristics—
including initial conditions, population size, GDP,
and political variables—does not reveal statistically
significant differences between commodity exporters
and other similar emerging market and developing
economies in terms of educational attainment, life
expectancy, or infant mortality (Figure 2.3.2).3

1McMahon and Moreira (2014) find that in the 2000s,
human development improved more rapidly in extractive commodity exporters than in countries that are not dependent on
extractive industries. Gylfason (2001) suggests that education levels were inversely related to resource abundance in the
1980–97 period.

been shown to have an impact on the quality of human capital

as population, level of GDP, political factors (regime change,

without controlling for any differences between them, whereas in

move in tandem with the commodity terms of trade.
Educational attainment and life expectancy rise faster
during commodity terms-of-trade upswings than during downswings (Figure 2.3.3). This comovement is
not surprising, since education and health outcomes
are likely to benefit from higher social spending
by the public sector and a faster-growing economy
during a commodity boom. However, the differences
between average changes in educational attainment
and life expectancy during upswings and downswings
are not statistically significant, which is probably
attributable to other contextual factors affecting these
variables during these episodes.
Using the local projection method allows some
contextual factors such as the output growth of
trading partners, domestic conflict, and political

regime change to be controlled for. Estimates from
that method show that the responses of educational
attainment are barely statistically significant following
changes in the net commodity terms of trade; those of
life expectancy are not statistically significant.
Infant mortality has a statistically significant negative response, but this result appears sensitive to the
inclusion of data from the 1970s and early 1980s,
when commodity windfalls allowed commodity

exporters to catch up with their noncommodityexporting peers—infant mortality among commodity
exporters fell by 30 to 50 percent over that period.
The result weakened during later decades, when the
pace of improvement slowed for both commodity
exporters and noncommodity exporters. During those
years upswings no longer brought statistically significant reductions, as marginal improvements appear to
have become progressively more difficult to achieve.

Box 2.4. Do Commodity Exporters’ Economies Overheat during Commodity Booms?
The model simulations presented in this chapter
predict that commodity booms will tend to be accompanied by overheating: if prices and wages adjust only
slowly to higher demand, the volume of output will
overreact and rise above its potential level (defined as
the level of output consistent with stable inflation). The
event studies presented in the chapter provide indirect
evidence of overheating during booms, documenting
that actual output tends to grow faster than trend output during prolonged upswings in the commodity terms
of trade (Figure 2.8, panel 4). Such a growth differential
would be likely to push actual output above potential
output over the duration of the boom.
The discussion here presents direct evidence of
overheating in six net commodity exporters during
the global commodity boom of the 2000s. Multivariate filtering is used to estimate potential output and
the output gap, both of which are unobserved. The
technique combines information on the relationship
between unemployment and inflation (Phillips curve)
on the one hand, and between unemployment and the
output gap (Okun’s law) on the other.1 It is based on
the notion that a positive (negative) output gap will
be correlated with excess demand (slack) in the labor
market and lead to increases (decreases) in inflation.
The six net exporters of commodities are Australia,
Canada, Chile, Norway, Peru, and Russia.2 The inflation process in these countries largely conforms to that
predicted by economic theory, with a broadly stable
relationship between inflation and unemployment.
The authors of this box are Oya Celasun, Douglas Laxton,
Hou Wang, and Fan Zhang.
1Chapter 3 of the April 2015 World Economic Outlook uses the
multivariate-filter methodology to estimate potential output for 16
countries. A detailed description of the methodology can be found
in Annex 3.2 of that report and in Blagrave and others 2015.
2The countries and time period chosen for the analysis reflect
the data requirements. Reliable unemployment series are not
available for a large number of commodity exporters, nor do
many countries show a broadly stable relationship between inflation and unemployment. To ensure a focus on the link between
the terms of trade and the output gap, estimates are shown for
the uninterrupted phase of the commodity boom prior to the
2008–09 global financial crisis.

The discussion focuses on the period 2002–07: the
uninterrupted phase of the boom in world commodity prices ahead of the volatility associated with the
2008–09 global financial crisis.
The analysis finds that the six economies moved into
excess demand as the commodity boom progressed
(Figure 2.4.1). The results are striking in that all six
economies show positive output gaps toward the end of
the prolonged commodity price boom. Moreover, the
changes in the output gap exhibit a positive correlation with the commodity terms of trade, even if the
estimation does not incorporate information on the
latter variable (Figure 2.4.2). That result underscores the
important role of the commodity terms of trade in driving cyclical fluctuations in net commodity exporters.
However, estimates of output gaps based on
multivariate filtering benefit from hindsight, in the

EXCHANGE RATES AND TRADE FLOWS: DISCONNECTED?

Figure 3.1. Recent Exchange Rate Movements in Historical
Perspective
(Percent; months on x-axis)

Recent exchange rate movements have been unusually
large, triggering a debate regarding their likely effects on
trade. Historical experience in advanced and emerging
market and developing economies suggests that exchange
rate movements typically have sizable effects on export
and import volumes. A 10 percent real effective depreciation in an economy’s currency is associated with a rise in
real net exports of, on average, 1.5 percent of GDP, with
substantial cross-country variation around this average.
Although these effects fully materialize over a number
of years, much of the adjustment occurs in the first year.
The boost to exports associated with currency depreciation
is found to be largest in countries with initial economic
slack and with domestic financial systems that are operating normally. Some evidence suggests that the rise of
global value chains has weakened the relationship between
exchange rates and trade in intermediate products used as
inputs into other economies’ exports. However, the bulk
of global trade still consists of conventional trade, and
there is little evidence of a general trend toward disconnect
between exchange rates and total exports and imports.

Introduction
Recent exchange rate movements have been unusually large. The U.S. dollar has appreciated by more
than 10 percent in real effective terms since mid-2014.
The euro has depreciated by more than 10 percent
since early 2014 and the yen by more than 30 percent since mid-2012 (Figure 3.1).1 Such movements,
although not unprecedented, are well outside these
currencies’ normal fluctuation ranges. Even for emerging market and developing economies, whose currencies typically fluctuate more than those of advanced
economies, the recent movements have been unusually
large.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: ADJUSTING TO LOWER COMMODITY PRICES

There is little consensus, however, on the likely
effects of these large exchange rate movements on
trade––exports and imports––and, therefore, on
economic activity. Some have predicted strong effects,
based on conventional economic models (Krugman 2015, for example). Others have pointed to the
limited changes in trade balances in some economies
following recent exchange rate movements—in Japan,
in particular—implying an apparent disconnect
between exchange rates and trade. It has also been
suggested that the increasing participation of firms
in global value chains has reduced the relevance of
exchange rate movements for trade flows, as in recent
studies conducted at the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (Ollivaud, Rusticelli,
and Schwellnus 2015) and the World Bank (Ahmed,
Appendino, and Ruta 2015).2
This is not the first time that the conventional
wisdom regarding the link between exchange rates
and trade has been questioned. In the late 1980s, for
example, the U.S. dollar depreciated, and the yen
appreciated sharply after the 1985 Plaza Accord, but
trade volumes were slow to adjust, leading some commentators to suggest a disconnect between exchange
rates and trade. By the early 1990s, however, U.S. and
Japanese trade balances had adjusted, after some lags,
largely in line with the predictions of conventional
models.3 A key question is whether this time is different, reflecting the changing structure of world trade
since the 1990s, or whether, once lags have played out,
the apparent disconnect between exchange rates and
trade will once again dissipate.
A disconnect between exchange rates and trade
would have profound policy implications. It could, in
particular, weaken a key channel for the transmission
of monetary policy by reducing the boost to exports
that comes with exchange rate depreciation when monetary policy eases. It could also complicate the resolution of trade imbalances (that is, when exports exceed
imports, or vice versa) via the adjustment of relative
trade prices.
To contribute to the debate on the likely effects of
recent currency movements and to assess whether trade
flows are becoming disconnected from exchange rates,
this chapter focuses on the following questions:
2As

explained in the discussion that follows, during the past
several decades, international trade has increasingly been organized
within so-called global value chains, with different stages of production located across different economies.
3See Krugman 1991 for a discussion of this episode.

International Monetary Fund | October 2015

•• Based on historical experience, how does trade
typically evolve following real exchange rate movements? In particular, to what extent do exchange
rate changes pass through to the relative prices of
exports and imports, and how strongly do trade
flows respond following these trade price changes?
How quickly do the adjustments occur?
•• Is there evidence of a disconnect between exchange
rates and trade over time? In particular, has the
changing structure of global trade, with increasing participation in global value chains, weakened
the relationship between exchange rates and trade?
Have either the long-term effects or the speed of
transmission of exchange rate movements declined
over time, making them less relevant for overall
trade?
To address these questions, the chapter starts by
investigating the relationship between exchange rate
changes and trade in advanced and emerging market and developing economies over the past three
decades. The growing importance of emerging market
and developing economies in world trade warrants
this broad coverage, which goes beyond the group of
economies typically examined in related studies.4 The
approach employs both standard trade equations and
an analysis of historical cases of large exchange rate
movements. The chapter then assesses whether the rise
of global value chains, also referred to as the international fragmentation of production, has weakened
the link between exchange rates and trade. Finally, it
investigates more generally whether there is evidence
of disconnect over time by estimating the relationship
between exchange rates and trade in different historical
periods.
The analysis focuses narrowly on the direct effect
of exchange rate changes on trade. Although the trade
channel is a critical channel for the transmission of
exchange rate changes to an economy, this partial
equilibrium focus on direct effects has limitations. By
definition, it ignores the general equilibrium effects
of exchange rate changes on overall economic activity, which involve not just the effects on trade, but
also those operating through other variables, including inflation expectations, interest rates, and domes-

4Much of the related literature focuses on advanced economies,
with a number of exceptions, including Bussière, Delle Chiaie, and
Peltonen 2014, which estimates trade price equations for 40 economies, and Morin and Schwellnus 2014.

CHAPTER 3

tic demand.5 Through the effects on these variables,
trade is also affected indirectly. The narrow focus also
abstracts from the fact that the underlying drivers of
an exchange rate change also matter for trade and
economic activity outcomes. The main reason that
these outcomes can differ is that the indirect effects
of exchange rate changes can differ, depending on
the driver. Consider, for example, the exchange rate
changes during the past year or so. As discussed in the
April 2015 World Economic Outlook (WEO), these
changes have been partly driven by surprises in the
relative strength of domestic demand, with countries
with stronger domestic demand experiencing appreciation. Compare this with another example, in which
the exchange rate change is not driven by domestic
demand, but reflects an unexpected shift in investor
preferences for U.S.-dollar-denominated assets. The
behavior of domestic demand in the two examples
would clearly be different, with implications for the
overall outcome for trade.
The chapter’s main findings are as follows:
•• Trade tends to respond strongly to exchange rate
movements. A depreciation in an economy’s currency is typically associated with lower export prices
paid by foreigners and higher domestic import
prices, and these price changes, in turn, lead to a
rise in exports and a decline in imports.6 Reflecting
these channels, a 10 percent real effective exchange
rate depreciation implies, on average, a 1.5 percent
of GDP increase in real net exports. The figures
around this average response vary widely across
economies (from 0.5 percent to 3.1 percent). It
takes a number of years for the effects to fully
materialize, but much of the adjustment occurs in
the first year. The export increase associated with
currency depreciation is typically stronger when the
domestic economy is experiencing more slack, but
weaker when a country’s financial system is weak, as
in the context of a banking crisis.
•• The rise of global value chains has weakened the
relationship between exchange rates and trade for
5For an example of a general equilibrium assessment of the effects
of exchange rate movements, see Scenario Box 2 in the April 2015
World Economic Outlook, which uses the IMF’s G20 Model to
explore the potential macroeconomic impact of real exchange rate
changes from August 2014 to February 2015 based on shocks that
represent changes in investor preferences for U.S.-dollar-denominated assets.
6There is little evidence of asymmetry—exchange rate appreciations and depreciations tend to have opposite effects, but of a similar
absolute size.

EXCHANGE RATES AND TRADE FLOWS: DISCONNECTED?

some economies and products, but little evidence
shows that it has led to a disconnect between
exchange rates and trade in general. In particular, for
economies that have become more deeply involved
in global value chains, trade in intermediate products used as inputs into other economies’ exports
has become less responsive to exchange rate changes.
However, the relative pace of expansion of globalvalue-chain-related trade has decelerated in recent
years, and the bulk of global trade still consists of
conventional trade.
•• More generally, the notion of a disconnect between
exchange rates, trade prices, and gross export and
import volumes finds little support in the data. The
estimated links have not generally weakened over
time. A key exception to this pattern is Japan, which
displays some evidence of disconnect, with weakerthan-expected export growth despite substantial
exchange rate depreciation, although this weak
export growth reflects a number of Japan-specific
factors.7

From Exchange Rates to Trade:
Historical Evidence
A natural benchmark for assessing the implications
of recent exchange rate movements is the historical relationship between exchange rates and trade.
Standard theoretical models predict that currency
depreciation will reduce the prices of exports in foreign
currency and increase the prices of imports in domestic currency, which will lead to more exports and
less imports.8 These theoretical predictions guide the
statistical analysis in this chapter.
This section starts by examining the historical evidence on the connection between exchange rates, trade
prices, and trade volumes for a large group of economies. It estimates export and import price and volume
equations for 60 individual economies––23 advanced
and 37 emerging market and developing economies––
for the past three decades. This is a broader sample of
economies than is typically covered in related studies.9
7These factors include, in particular, the acceleration in production
offshoring since the global financial crisis and the 2011 earthquake.
8The response of trade volumes to relative trade prices relates to
the expenditure-switching effect discussed, for example, in Obstfeld
and Rogoff 2007.
9Related studies also tend to focus on either the effect of exchange
rates on relative trade prices or the effect of relative trade prices on
volumes. In contrast, the analysis here focuses on both parts of the

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: ADJUSTING TO LOWER COMMODITY PRICES

To contribute more directly to the debate on the
recent large exchange rate changes, the section also
presents evidence on trade dynamics following unusually large exchange rate movements. The focus is on the
evolution of export prices and volumes following large
and sudden currency depreciations in both advanced
and emerging market and developing economies.

Revisiting Trade Elasticities
To inform the assessment of the likely impact of the
recent large exchange rate movements on trade, this
subsection estimates standard trade elasticities (that is,
how responsive trade variables are to changes in other
variables) for both advanced and emerging market
and developing economies. In particular, it focuses on
estimating four elasticities: the relationship between
exchange rate movements and export and import
prices, respectively (exchange rate pass-through), and
the relationship between these export and import
prices and trade volumes (price elasticity), based on
standard trade equations. The emphasis is on longterm effects of exchange rate movements, although the
discussion also touches on how much of these longterm effects materialize in the near term.
The theoretical framework underlying the analysis comes from the pricing-to-market literature, as
described in Krugman 1986, Feenstra, Gagnon, and
Knetter 1996, Campa and Goldberg 2005, Burstein
and Gopinath 2014, and others. In this framework,
exporting firms maximize profits by choosing export
prices subject to the demand for their products in
foreign markets, taking into account their competitors’ prices.10 Product demand depends on the prices
of exports relative to the prices of competing products
as well as on overall demand conditions in destination
markets. Based on these assumptions, export prices
relative to foreign prices depend on the real exchange
rate and real production costs, while export quantities
depend on these relative export prices as well as on
foreign aggregate demand. The determinants of import
prices and quantities can be derived analogously based
on the observation that the price of each economy’s

exchange rate transmission process, thus providing a more comprehensive assessment.
10This literature assumes market segmentation between domestic
and foreign purchasers.

108

imports is the price of its trading partners’ exports
multiplied by the bilateral exchange rate.11
The analysis estimates the four trade elasticities at
the individual-economy level using annual data for
60 economies. Depending on data availability and
the economy in question, the sample starts between
1980 and 1989 and ends in 2014. To permit the
long-term relationship between exchange rate changes
and trade to be estimated, the sample is restricted to
economies for which at least 25 years of annual data
are available.12 The analysis focuses on gross exports
and imports, which include both goods and services
(Annex 3.1 reports the sources of the data used). The
econometric specifications employed are standard and
yield estimates of the relationship between exchange
rates and trade prices and between trade prices and
trade volumes.13
11In this framework, the export price equation reflects optimal pricing decisions of suppliers and can be written as eP X/P* =
S(ULC/P, eP/P*), in which e is the nominal exchange rate, P X is the
price of exports in domestic currency, P* is the foreign price level,
P is the domestic price level, ULC/P denotes the real unit labor
cost, and eP/P* denotes the real effective exchange rate. The export
volume equation represents the demand side of the market and can
be written as X = D(eP X/P*, Y*), in which eP X/P* is the relative
export price in foreign currency already mentioned and Y* denotes
foreign aggregate demand. On the import side, the relative prices of
imports are a function of the real exchange rate and domestic aggregate demand, P M/P = S(eP*/P, Y ), in which Y denotes domestic
aggregate demand, and import volumes are a function of this relative
price and domestic aggregate demand, M = D(P M/P, Y ).
12The sample excludes a number of advanced economies with
special circumstances, including Hong Kong SAR and Singapore,
given these economies’ significant entrepôt activity, and Ireland,
given its special treatment of export sales (April 2015 WEO). To
avoid unduly influencing the estimation results with developments
in small or very low-income economies, it also excludes economies
with fewer than 1 million inhabitants as of 2010 or with an average
per capita income (at purchasing-power parity) of less than $3,000
in 2014 prices.
13The analysis is based on log-linear specifications for the four
trade equations. For each equation, the analysis checks whether the
variables included are cointegrated based on a Dickey-Fuller test, in
which case the equations are estimated in levels. For example, for
export prices, the specification estimated in levels for each economy

EXCHANGE RATES AND TRADE FLOWS: DISCONNECTED?

A number of issues complicate the estimation of
trade elasticities and can bias the analysis against finding any effect of exchange rate movements on trade.
Different economic developments can lead to different joint evolutions of trade prices and quantities,
complicating the estimation of the causal effects of
trade prices on quantities. The main potential source
of this simultaneity problem is the movement in either
domestic or foreign demand. For example, a contraction in foreign demand can cause a simultaneous
decline in both the quantity and the price of exports,
obscuring the conventional positive effect of a drop in
export prices on export demand. And when domestic
demand growth is weak, reducing imports, the price of
imports may also fall, obscuring the positive effect of
lower import prices on imports. The analysis addresses
this source of endogeneity by controlling for foreign
and domestic output.14 This leaves shifts in the composition of demand or in the propensity to import for a
given composition of demand. The analysis attempts to
control for shifts in composition by including nonexports and exports together in the import equation, but
controlling for shifts in import propensities is challenging. Overall, because of these remaining sources of
bias, weak or perversely signed estimation results could
still arise, although they do not necessarily imply that
trade is unresponsive to changes in trade prices.15

Figure 3.2. Long-Term Exchange Rate Pass-Through and Price
Elasticities

P and P* terms in the equation are replaced with the domestic and
foreign CPI. The estimate for β provides the long-term effect of the
exchange rate on export prices. Short-term effects are obtained by
estimating, in a second step, the equation in error correction form,
as explained in Annex 3.2. The equations for estimating the other
elasticities are set up analogously, as also explained in Annex 3.2.
14Moreover, all equations also include a time trend to account for
secular trends in the variables and a dummy variable (which equals
1 during 2008–09) to account for the global financial crisis and
the interaction of this crisis dummy with the measure of foreign
output in the export volume equation and with the measure of
domestic output in the import volume equation, respectively. These
interaction terms address the notion that trade responded unusually
strongly to demand during the crisis (see, for example, Bussière and
others 2013). In addition, to control for shifts in global commodity prices, which can affect exporting firms’ costs, the equations for
export and import prices control for the (log) indices of international fuel and nonfuel commodity prices. To ensure the results are
not driven by periods of high inflation (such episodes can be caused
by factors that have an independent effect on trade), the sample
excludes years in which CPI inflation exceeds 30 percent. As a
further precaution against outliers, observations with Cook’s distance
greater than 4/N, where N is the sample size, are discarded.
15A large literature that goes back to Orcutt (1950) explains how
simultaneity and omitted-variable issues can lead to considerable
underestimation of trade price elasticities. Another issue that biases
the analysis against finding a strong effect of trade price changes
on trade is that of heterogeneous elasticities across different goods.

Results: From Exchange Rates to Trade Prices
The analysis suggests that exchange rate movements
typically have substantial effects on trade prices, with
the estimates of long-term pass-through elasticities
having the expected sign for virtually all the economies
considered (Figure 3.2). The estimates of exchange rate
pass-through typically lie, as would be expected, in the
0–1 interval. The results imply that, on average, a 10
percent real effective currency depreciation increases
import prices by 6.1 percent and reduces export prices
Different goods have different price elasticities, but movements in
aggregate trade prices may be dominated by movements in the relative prices of price-inelastic goods. This dominance would dampen
estimated price effects on trade flows. In fact, micro-level estimates
of trade elasticities tend to be somewhat larger than those based on
aggregate data, as discussed by Feenstra and others (2014) and Imbs
and Mejean (2015).

in foreign currency by 5.5 percent (Table 3.1).16 The
estimation results are broadly in line with existing
studies for major economies.17 It is interesting to note
that economies with stronger exchange rate passthrough to export prices in foreign currency tend to
have weaker pass-through to domestic import prices, a
pattern that also emerges from the findings of Bussière,
Delle Chiaie, and Peltonen (2014). The results also
indicate that most of the long-term effects on trade
prices materialize within one year.18

16The corresponding response of export prices in domestic currency
to a real effective currency depreciation of 10 percent would be a rise
of 4.5 percent (–10 × (0.552 – 1)).
17For example, the results are strongly correlated with those
reported in a recent study by Bussière, Delle Chiaie, and Peltonen
(2014), who report pass-through elasticities for 40 economies
(Annex Figure 3.2.1).
18The estimates of pass-through to trade prices also have implications for the estimated effect of a change in the exchange rate on
the terms of trade (the price of exports relative to imports), which
have implications for domestic demand. The baseline long-term
pass-through estimates reported in Table 3.1 are 0.55 for export
prices in foreign currency and −0.61 for import prices in domestic
currency. So a 1 percent appreciation in a country’s currency lowers
the domestic prices of its imports by 0.61 percent and raises the
foreign-currency price of exports by 0.55 percent. This means that
the domestic-currency price of exports falls by 0.45 percent (0.55 −
1) and the terms of trade improve by 0.16 percent (−0.45 − (−0.61))
following a 1 percent appreciation. This is well below the full passthrough case in which a 1 percent appreciation translates into a 1
percent improvement in the terms of trade.

Results: From Trade Prices to Trade Volumes
The analysis suggests that trade price movements
typically have the expected effects on export and import
volumes, with most individual-economy estimates having the conventional (negative) sign (Figure 3.2, panel
2). On average, the estimated price elasticities of volumes suggest that a 10 percent rise in export and import
prices reduces the level of both export and import
volumes by about 3 percent in the long term (Table
3.1). The results also indicate that most of the long-term
effects on trade volumes materialize within one year.
At the same time, numerous individual-economy
estimates have counterintuitive (positive) signs. Given
the challenges already mentioned of identifying the
effects of trade prices on volumes, these exceptions
are not surprising, and the true effects are likely to be
stronger than suggested by the cross-country averages reported in Table 3.1. Also, the sample includes a
range of economies, including some for whom fuel and
nonfuel primary products constitute the main source
of export earnings (exceeding 50 percent of total
exports). To investigate whether these primary-product
exporters have a strong influence on the estimation
results, the analysis is repeated while excluding them
from the sample. The results are similar to the baseline,
suggesting that these economies are not driving the
results (Table 3.1).
Meanwhile, the effects of shifts in foreign and
domestic aggregate demand on export and import volumes have the expected positive sign for all economies

CHAPTER 3

Overall Effect on Net Exports
What do the estimates for price and volume elasticities imply for the overall effect of exchange rate
movements on net exports? To answer this question,
the analysis combines the average estimates for the
four elasticities reported in Table 3.1, which are more
reliable than the individual-economy estimates, with
economy-specific shares of imports and exports in real
GDP.21 The results suggest that a 10 percent real effective depreciation in an economy’s currency is associated
with a rise in real net exports of, on average, 1.5 percent of GDP, with substantial cross-country variation
around this average (Figure 3.3). Given the wide range
of GDP shares of exports and imports across economies, this implied effect of a real effective depreciation of 10 percent ranges from 0.5 percent of GDP
to 3.1 percent of GDP. Although it takes a number of
years for these effects to fully materialize, much of the
adjustment occurs in the first year, as mentioned.22
19As mentioned, the equation estimated for import volumes
decomposes the effects of aggregate demand into exports and domestic demand for domestic goods. The estimated elasticities for these
two components of aggregate demand are both 0.7, consistent with a
combined aggregate demand elasticity of 1.4.
20For a broader discussion of the role of foreign and domestic
output in driving trade, including during the postcrisis decline in
global trade, see Chapter 4 of the October 2010 WEO and Hoekman 2015.
21The effect of a real exchange rate movement on real net exports
as a percentage of GDP is defined as ηPX ηX (X/Y) – ηPM ηM
(M/Y), in which ηPX and ηX denote the exchange rate pass-through
to export prices and the price elasticity of exports, respectively, and
ηPM and ηM denote the exchange rate pass-through to import prices
and the price elasticity of imports, respectively. Given the focus on
the effects of exchange rate movements since 2012, the shares of
exports and imports in GDP (X/Y and M/Y, respectively) as of 2012
are used in the calculation. Combining the estimates in the first row
of Table 3.1 with the sample averages for exports and imports in
percent of GDP as of 2012 (42 and 41 percent of GDP, respectively)
yields an estimated rise in net exports of 1.47 percent of GDP following a real effective depreciation of 10 percent.
22Similarly, the estimates indicate that the Marshall-Lerner condition holds, so that a currency depreciation improves the nominal
trade balance. Note that, in the presence of imperfect pass-through,

in the sample (Annex Figure 3.2.2). On average, a 1
percent increase in trading-partner aggregate demand
is associated with a 2.3 percent increase in exports. A
1 percent increase in domestic aggregate demand is
associated with a 1.4 percent increase in imports.19
These results confirm that shifts in relative demand
have a strong bearing on trade, a link that has featured
prominently in the policy debate on the postcrisis
decline in global trade.20

Insights from Large Exchange Rate Depreciation
Episodes
To contribute more directly to the debate about
the effects of the recent large exchange rate changes,
this subsection presents evidence of the effects of
large and sudden depreciations. In a number of cases,
these episodes coincide with currency crisis episodes
identified in the literature. A study of trade dynamics following such relatively extreme events allows the
analysis to provide better estimates of export elasticities. (The exercise is less able to identify import
elasticities because various domestic developments
that affect imports coincide with large exchange rate
depreciations.) The analysis focuses on large exchange
rate depreciation episodes not associated with banking crises, given that such crises can have additional
confounding effects on trade. Overall, large exchange
rate depreciation episodes are likely to include a larger
exogenous component than more normal exchange rate
the Marshall-Lerner condition is (–ERPT of P X) (1 + price elasticity
of X ) + (ERPT of P M) (1 + price elasticity of M) + 1 > 0, in which
ERPT denotes exchange rate pass-through, as explained in Annex
3.3. The Marshall-Lerner condition computed here is based on
the cross-country average of estimates reported in Table 3.1. The
condition also holds for much—though not all—of the sample,
when individual-economy elasticity estimates, rather than the sample
averages, are used in the calculation.

fluctuations and are more appropriate for estimating
the relationship between exchange rates and trade.23
Identifying Large Exchange Rate Depreciation Episodes
The analysis identifies large exchange rate depreciation episodes using a statistical approach similar to those
employed in the literature. The approach is based on
two criteria. The first criterion identifies a large depreciation as an unusually sharp nominal depreciation of
the currency against the U.S. dollar. This identification approach is based on a numerical threshold set
at the 90th percentile of all annual depreciations in
the sample.24 The second criterion prevents the same
large exchange rate depreciation episode from being
captured more than once. It requires the change in the
depreciation rate compared with the previous year to be
unusually large (greater than the 90th percentile of all
changes). Because exchange rates tend to be more volatile in emerging market and developing economies than
in advanced economies, both thresholds are defined
separately for the two groups of economies. For the
first criterion, the threshold for advanced economies is
a depreciation of 13 percent against the dollar, whereas
for emerging market and developing economies, the
threshold is 20 percent. For the second criterion, both
thresholds are about 13 percentage points.
To ensure that the results are not unduly influenced
by high-inflation episodes, the analysis considers only
large exchange rate depreciations that occur when
the inflation rate is less than 30 percent. In addition,
the analysis focuses on episodes not associated with
banking crises to avoid confounding factors associated with credit supply disruptions. In particular, large
exchange rate depreciation episodes occurring within
three years of a banking crisis based on Laeven and
Valencia’s (2013) data set are discarded. The effects of
large depreciations associated with banking crises are
considered separately later in the chapter.
23Although this episode-based approach addresses some of the
problems associated with the conventional approach of estimating
the effects of exchange rates on trade, it is subject to the criticism
that large depreciation episodes could be triggered by a policy
response to unusually weak export performance in the context of an
unsustainable balance of payments deficit. In that case, the episodes
would tend to be associated with unusually weak export growth,
biasing the analysis against finding that currency depreciation causes
a rise in exports.
24This approach of identifying large exchange rate depreciation
episodes based on statistical thresholds is similar to that of Laeven
and Valencia (2013), who in turn build on the approach of Frankel
and Rose (1996).

112

International Monetary Fund | October 2015

Applying this strategy to all economies that have
data on export volumes and prices during 1980–2014
yields 66 large exchange rate depreciation episodes.25
As reported in Annex Table 3.4.1, about one-quarter
(17) of these large exchange rate depreciations occurred
in advanced economies. They include, for example,
European economies affected by the 1992 European
Exchange Rate Mechanism crisis. The remaining
episodes occurred in emerging market and developing
economies and include, for example, the devaluation of
the Chinese yuan in 1994 and the large depreciation of
the Venezuelan bolívar in 2002.26
What Happens to Exports after a Large Exchange
Rate Depreciation?
Now that large exchange rate depreciation episodes
have been identified, this subsection uses statistical
techniques to assess the relationship between exchange
rates and export prices and export volumes. The
methodology is standard and follows Cerra and Saxena
2008 and Romer and Romer 2010, among others. In
particular, the average responses of export prices and
export volumes to a large depreciation are estimated
separately using panel data analysis.27
25For

the purpose of the panel estimation conducted in this
subsection, the sample includes all economies that have data on
export volumes and prices during 1980–2014. Thus, 158 economies
are included in the sample. For a number of the 158 economies, no
large exchange rate depreciation episodes are identified, and the data
for these economies serve to estimate the dynamic structure of the
equations. Note that, in contrast, for the individual-economy estimates
reported earlier in the chapter, the sample includes only the 60 economies with at least 25 years of data on relative trade prices and volumes.
26A number of well-known large exchange rate depreciation
episodes were associated with banking crises and are therefore not
included in the baseline sample for analysis, for example, Mexico in
1994, Russia in 1998, Argentina in 2002, and Finland and Sweden
in the early 1990s.
27The estimated equation makes use of an autoregressive distributed lags model in first differences. The estimated lagged impacts of
an episode of large exchange rate depreciation are then cumulated to
obtain the dynamic impact on the level of export prices and export
volumes. For export prices, the estimated equation has the change
in the log of export prices in foreign currency as the dependent variable on the left-hand side. On the right-hand side, the explanatory
variables are the current and lagged values of the dummy variable
indicating an episode of large exchange rate depreciation. Including lags allows for a delayed impact of a large depreciation. In
addition, the approach controls for lags of the change in the log of
export prices in foreign currency, to distinguish the effect of a large
depreciation from that of normal dynamics. The equation estimated
for export prices is
yit = a + ∑2j=1 bj yi,t–j + ∑2s=0 bs Si,t–s + mi + lt + υit,
in which the subscript i denotes the ith country and the subscript t
denotes the tth year; y is the log change in export prices in foreign

CHAPTER 3

The results suggest that large depreciations substantially boost exports. By definition, the episodes studied
are associated with large depreciations, and the results
indicate that these depreciations average 25 percent in
real effective terms over five years (Figure 3.4). Export
prices in foreign currency fall by about 10 percent, with
much of the adjustment occurring in the first year. The
implied pass-through elasticity of export prices relative
to the real exchange rate is thus about 0.4, similar to the
estimate based on trade equations already noted.
Export volumes rise more gradually, by about 10
percent over five years.28 This response indicates an
average price elasticity of exports of about –0.7, which
is stronger than the elasticity of –0.3 estimated using
the traditional trade equations discussed earlier. This
stronger estimated price elasticity could reflect the
clearer identification strategy based on large exchange
rate depreciation episodes. All the results are statistically significant at conventional levels.29

Do Initial Economic Conditions Matter?
Do export dynamics following large depreciations
differ depending on initial economic conditions? When
there is more economic slack and a greater degree of
spare capacity in the economy, there could be more
scope for production and exports to expand following
a rise in foreign demand associated with exchange rate
depreciation. Intuitively, this is because the volume
of exports sold depends not only on the strength of
demand, but also on an economy’s ability to adjust production in response to stronger demand. After all, while
an individual firm can readily expand its export production by purchasing more inputs, a national economy has
to either utilize unemployed resources or move resources
eP X , in which P* is the foreign (trade-weighted)
currency, y = D ln —–
P*
consumer price index; and S is the dummy variable indicating the
occurrence of a large depreciation. The approach includes a full
set of country dummies (mi) to take into account differences in
countries’ normal growth rates. The estimated equation also includes
a full set of time dummies (lt) to take into account global shocks
such as shifts in oil prices or global business cycles. For the real effective exchange rate (REER) and for export volumes, the dependent
variable is replaced with y = D ln(REER) and y = D ln(X), respectively. For the study of export volumes, the analysis also controls for
changes in foreign demand, proxied by trading-partner GDP growth.
28Consistent with this result, Alessandria, Pratap, and Yue (2013)
find that exports rise gradually following a large depreciation, based
on data for 11 emerging market economies.
29These results are robust to the use of a number of alternative
specifications and methodologies to estimate the impulse responses
or to identify the large exchange rate movements, as explained in
Annex 3.4.

from nontraded into traded goods production. Economies may vary in the speed of their ability to reallocate
resources in this way, although this issue would be less
salient in the presence of economic slack.
To investigate this possibility, the analysis divides the
66 identified episodes of depreciation in half according
to the degree of economic slack in the year preceding

the exchange rate depreciation.30 The results suggest
that, for the subsample of episodes with less economic
slack, the impact of the depreciation on exports is still
positive but close to zero (Figure 3.5).31 By contrast,
for the subsample with more initial slack in the economy, the export gain is larger than in the full-sample
baseline (by an additional 7 percentage points after five
years). While this result is not surprising from an analytical viewpoint, it has not been highlighted in related
studies. The exchange rate also tends to depreciate by
more and in a more persistent manner than in the
baseline, arguably providing exporters with stronger
incentives to cut export prices than in the baseline.

Does the boost to exports associated with a large
exchange rate depreciation depend on the health of
the exporting economy’s financial sector? In principle,
banking crises can depress exports by reducing the
availability of credit needed to expand export production.32 This drop in credit availability could offset the
export gains due to the currency depreciation.
To shed light on this question, the analysis in this
subsection focuses on large exchange rate depreciation
episodes associated with banking crises. In particular, it applies the same criteria used in the previous subsections, identifying 57 episodes in which a
30The degree of economic slack is defined here based on real
GDP growth in the year preceding the episode of large exchange
rate depreciation, as explained in Annex 3.4. The results are broadly
similar when the definition of economic slack is based on the output
gap in the year preceding the large exchange rate depreciation.
31To ease comparability of the estimation results for the two
groups, the estimated impulse responses are scaled to ensure that the
first-year impact on the real exchange rate is exactly the same. Such
rescaling is performed in all later comparisons of large exchange rate
depreciation episodes.
32Ronci (2004) analyzes the effect of constrained trade finance on
trade flows in countries undergoing financial and balance of payments crises and concludes that constrained trade finance depresses
both export and import volumes in the short term. Dell’Ariccia,
Detragiache, and Rajan (2005) and Iacovone and Zavacka (2009)
find that banking crises have a detrimental effect on real activity in
sectors more dependent on external finance, which includes exportoriented sectors. Kiendrebeogo (2013) investigates whether banking
crises are associated with declines in bilateral exports, by estimating a gravity model using a sample of advanced economies and
developing countries for the period 1988–2010. The results suggest
that ­banking-crisis-hit countries experience lower levels of bilateral
exports, with exports of manufactured goods falling particularly
strongly. More generally, for an analysis of the evolution of trade
following large depreciations associated with financial crises, see
Chapter 4 of the October 2010 WEO.

CHAPTER 3

banking crisis (again, based on the data set of Laeven
and Valencia 2013) occurred in the three-year period
before or after the large exchange rate depreciation
(see Annex Table 3.4.2). By definition, these 57
episodes are not the same set as those included in the
baseline analysis. They include, for example, the large
exchange rate depreciations in Finland and Sweden in
1993; Thailand and Korea in 1997 and 1998, respectively; Russia in 1998; Brazil in 1999; and Argentina
in 2002.
The results suggest that the boost to exports is
indeed weaker when an exchange rate depreciation
is associated with a banking crisis (Figure 3.6). In
particular, export prices decline by less, suggesting an
average elasticity of export prices to the real effective
exchange rate of 0.25, about half that observed in the
baseline case. The response of real exports is near zero.
These results are consistent with the view that the
credit constraint exporting firms face when a country’s
financial sector is weak limits their ability to borrow
and increases their exporting capacity when the currency depreciates.33
At the same time, banking crises result in a wide
range of outcomes, as discussed in the literature (see
Chapter 4 of the October 2009 WEO, for example).
For a number of the episodes associated with banking
crises analyzed here, exports outperformed the nearzero average effect—for example, for the large depreciations of Argentina (2002), Brazil (1999), Russia
(1998), and Sweden (1993), for which the estimated
effect on exports is positive.34
Overall, the results based on the analysis of traditional trade equations and large exchange rate depreciation episodes suggest that trade responds substantially
to the exchange rate according to the historical evidence and that the conventional expenditure-­switching
effects apply. The rise in exports associated with
exchange rate depreciation is likely to be largest when
there is slack in the economy and when the financial
sector is operating normally.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: ADJUSTING TO LOWER COMMODITY PRICES

Disconnect or Stability?
The analysis so far has assumed that the historical relationship between exchange rates and trade has
been stable over time and thus provides an appropriate
benchmark for assessing the implications of the recent
exchange rate movements. This section investigates
whether this assumption is warranted or whether trade
and exchange rates have become disconnected. It starts
by investigating the role of the rise of global value
chains, with the associated international fragmentation
of production, in reducing the links between exchange
rates and trade—an issue that has featured prominently in the recent policy debate on disconnect. It
then investigates more generally whether the relationship between exchange rates and trade flows—either
measured using the traditional trade equations or based
on large exchange rate depreciation episodes—has
weakened.

Disconnect and the Rise of Global Value Chains
Gross trade flows can be decomposed into trade
related to global value chains (trade in intermediate goods that serve as inputs into other economies’
exports) and other trade. This section begins with a
brief overview of the rise of global value chains during
the past several decades. Then it explains why trade
related to global value chains could respond more
weakly than traditional trade to exchange rate changes
and assesses the evidence.35
The Rise of Global Value Chains
During the past several decades, international
trade has been increasingly organized within so-called
global value chains, with different stages of production distributed across different economies. Production
fragmentation has grown as economies increasingly
specialize in adding value at some stage of production
rather than producing entire final products. Exports
of domestic value added have gradually declined as a
fraction of gross exports, while the share of exports
consisting of imported intermediate products, that is,
foreign value added, has increased. At the same time,
the share of intermediate goods in total exports is
35The

extent to which the rise of global value chains matters for
the relationship between exchange rates and trade depends on the
share of the related trade in gross trade flows and on the degree
to which the related trade responds differently to exchange rate
fluctuations.

116

International Monetary Fund | October 2015

rising, while the share of final products is declining.
As a result, export competitiveness is determined not
only by the exchange rate and price level of the export
destination economy, but also by the exchange rate and
price level of the economy at the end of the production chain.
Participation in global value chains is measured
along two dimensions: backward (import) links with
previous production stages and forward (export) links
with subsequent production stages.
•• Backward participation. As global value chains have
become more prevalent, the share of gross exports
consisting of inputs imported from abroad has
increased. Hence, the share of foreign value added
in gross exports has gradually risen from a crosscountry average of about 15 percent of gross exports
in the 1970s to about 25 percent in 2013 (Figure
3.7). However, for some economies, such as Hungary, Romania, Mexico, Thailand, and Ireland, the
increase has been greater than 20 percentage points,
substantially larger than the cross-country average.
Some evidence indicates that the rise of global value
chains measured along this dimension has slowed in
recent years. Indeed, Constantinescu, Mattoo, and
Ruta (2015) find that the slower pace of global value
chain expansion has contributed to the global trade
slowdown observed since the global financial crisis.
•• Forward participation. With the rise of global value
chains, the share of exports consisting of intermediate inputs used by trading partners for production of
their exports has increased. The share has increased
gradually, to 24 percent from 20 percent of gross
exports, on average, during the period 1995–2009
(Figure 3.7). Russia, Chile, Indonesia, Japan, and
Korea have seen the largest rises.
These two measures could be used to assess a country’s relative position in global value chains. Economies
toward the end (downstream) of production chains are
more likely to have strong backward but weak forward
links. Those closer to the origin (upstream) of production chains are more likely to have strong forward but
weak backward links.
Global Value Chain Participation and Trade
Elasticities
What effect does increased participation in global
value chains have on the responsiveness of trade to
exchange rates?
•• Exchange rate pass-through. If the share of foreign value added in exports is large, a currency

CHAPTER 3

­ epreciation can substantially increase the cost of an
d
economy’s imported inputs if the input composition
remains unchanged.36 This higher cost may then
be passed on to the next production stage. Hence,
foreign-currency export prices might not decline
as much as in the conventional case of no foreignvalue-added content, implying a weaker exchange
rate pass-through to export prices.37 The likely
impact of the rise of global value chains on passthrough to import prices is less clear.
•• Price elasticities. Demand for an economy’s exports
ultimately depends on the demand conditions and
the price competitiveness of the finished product
in the final destination market. With production
increasingly fragmented across international borders,
however, the final buyers at the end of an economy’s
production chain may not be among the economy’s
direct trading partners. This lack of direct connection complicates the estimation of the traditional
trade relationship discussed earlier in the chapter. In
particular, it could lead to “measurement error” in
the sense that export prices become a weaker signal
of true price competitiveness, and this measurement
error could bias estimates of the effect of export
prices on export demand toward zero. An analogous
argument applies to the relationship between import
prices and imports, since imports increasingly reflect
developments in exports. An increase in import
prices resulting from an exchange rate depreciation could coincide with lower export prices and
stronger demand for exports and, therefore, a rise
in import demand. The rise in the price of imports
could then be associated with a perverse increase
in imports despite higher import prices, counter to
the traditional expenditure-switching logic. Overall,
estimated export and import price elasticities could
be smaller the more an economy participates in
global value chains. The same reasoning also applies
to the estimated effect of exchange rate movements
on net exports.

36However, the composition of inputs might not remain
unchanged, because foreign importers of intermediates can, at least
in principle, substitute among a variety of suppliers to minimize
production costs.
37At the same time a large fraction of trade in value added is
within the same firm rather than between different firms. When a
country’s currency depreciates and export profits increase, firms may
change export prices to shift some of their profits to foreign affiliates.
Such transfer pricing behavior could alter pass-through to export
prices, thus confounding the effect on pass-through attributable to
global value chains.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: ADJUSTING TO LOWER COMMODITY PRICES

In general, increased participation in global value
chains could lower the effects of exchange movements
on trade prices and of trade prices on trade volumes.
At the same time, although trade related to global
value chains has grown in recent decades, the bulk
of global trade still consists of conventional trade. In
addition, as already mentioned, the average increase
in the share of foreign value added in exports has
generally been gradual and has recently slowed. Thus,
the rising share of foreign value added is unlikely
to have dramatically reduced the responsiveness of
gross exports and imports to exchange rates for most
countries. The overall evidence regarding a rising
disconnect between exchange rates and trade, which
reflects not only the rise of global value chains but
also other factors, is assessed later in the chapter. That
analysis does not suggest a general weakening of the
relationship between exchange rates, trade prices, and
total trade volumes.
However, beyond the implications of global value
chains for the relationship between overall gross trade
flows and exchange rates, increased participation in
value chains may have a bearing on the relationship
between exchange rates and trade in global-valuechain-related goods. Box 3.1 assesses the evidence. In
particular, it estimates the relationship between trade
in global-value-chain-related goods and real effective exchange rates. It finds that a real appreciation
of a country’s currency not only reduces its exports
of domestic value added, but also lowers its imports
of foreign value added (in contrast to the traditional
rise in imports following currency appreciation). This
latter result is consistent with the notion that globalvalue-chain-related domestic and foreign value added
are complements in production.38 So producing and
exporting less domestic value added would also reduce
the derived demand for imported foreign value added.
In addition, the analysis finds that the magnitudes of
import and export elasticities depend on the size of a
country’s contribution to global value chains—smaller
domestic contribution of value added tends to dampen
the response to exchange rate changes (see Cheng

38It is important to keep a macroeconomic perspective on this
issue. Input substitution for product categories or some industries
may rise. Generally, however, once a firm arranges production processes with a foreign supplier, it may well continue working with the
supplier for some time to recoup sunk costs of moving production
abroad. A generally low degree of substitutability between domestic
and foreign input suppliers could thus be expected.

118

International Monetary Fund | October 2015

and others, forthcoming; and IMF 2015a, 2015b,
2015c).39
Finally, the rise of global value chains has implications
for competitiveness assessments. As already mentioned,
in a value chain, the cost of producing an economy’s
goods as well the demand for them can depend on
the exchange rates of economies that are not among
the economy’s direct trading partners. Thus, the real
effective exchange rate relevant for competitiveness
assessments not only needs to include the country’s
direct trading partners but must also take into account
all participants in the value chain, including the final
consumers. Such a measure, the so-called value-added
real effective exchange rate, is described in Box 3.2. This
measure depends on the final destinations of exported
domestic value added, and it accounts for product
substitutability in demand and production. As Box 3.2
reports, a number of economically important differences
arise between value-added real effective exchange rates
and conventional real effective exchange rates. However,
overall, the two measures are strongly correlated, in part
because the vast majority of trade does not consist of
global-value-chain-related trade.40
Overall, the evidence suggests that, for economies
that have become more deeply involved in global value
chains, trade in global-value-chain-related products
has become less strongly responsive to exchange rate
changes. At the same time, although global-valuechain-related trade has gradually increased through
the decades, the relative pace of its expansion appears
to have decelerated in recent years, and the bulk of
global trade still consists of conventional trade. The
rise of global value chains is thus unlikely to have
39Consistent with this result, Ahmed, Appendino, and Ruta (2015)
find that the response of gross exports of manufactured goods to real
exchange rate movements is weaker in economies with a higher share
of foreign value added in gross exports, and Ollivaud, Rusticelli, and
Schwellnus (2015) find that the elasticity of the terms of trade to the
exchange rate is weaker in such economies. In related work based on
firm-level data, Amiti, Itskhoki, and Konings (2014) find that importintensive exporters have significantly lower exchange rate pass-through
to their (foreign currency) export prices. Eichengreen and Tong (2015)
find that renminbi appreciation has a positive effect on the stock market valuation of firms in sectors exporting final goods to China, with
a negligible effect on those providing inputs for China’s processing
exports. The IMF (2015d) provides additional evidence, using data for
Singapore, that products that have a higher foreign-value-added share
respond more weakly to relative export prices.
40This observation also suggests that biases in estimated valueadded trade relations due to incorrect use of standard real effective
exchange rates could be small. The same implication applies to the
estimation of gross trade relations based on value-added real effective
exchange rates.

CHAPTER 3

dramatically altered the responsiveness of gross exports
and imports to exchange rates. This notion is further
investigated in the next subsection.

Disconnect over Time?
This subsection investigates more generally whether
the relationship between exchange rate movements and
trade—either long-term effects or transmission lags—has
weakened over time. Numerous developments beyond
the rise of global value chains could, in principle, have
altered the effects of exchange rate movements. Some,
such as the liberalization of trade flows and increased
international competition associated with globalization, may have increased the responsiveness of trade to
exchange rates. Others, such as the rise of pricing to
market among several emerging markets and the moderation and stabilization of inflation in some economies,
may have reduced the effects of changes in exchange
rates on trade prices.41 The question is whether, taken
together, these developments have led to a disconnect.
Stability Tests
To check whether the estimated links between
exchange rates and trade have weakened, the analysis
reestimates the four trade elasticities already discussed
for successive 10-year rolling intervals. The first 10-year
interval used for estimation is 1990–99 and the last is
2005–14. Since a period of 10 years provides insufficient data to estimate the elasticities for individual
economies (based on annual data), the analysis is based
on a panel estimation approach that combines data for
multiple economies.42
41Frankel, Parsley, and Wei (2012) and Gust, Leduc, and Vigfusson (2010) provide evidence on the declining exchange rate passthrough to import prices over time. Shifts in the invoice currency
chosen by economies are also likely to play a role (see Gopinath,
Itskhoki, and Rigobon 2010).
42For each region, the analysis is based on the estimation of a
multieconomy panel for the four trade equations already discussed.
Given the lack of evidence of cointegration for the panel of economies considered (as assessed based on the panel cointegration tests in
Pedroni 2004), the specification is estimated in first differences. For
example, for export prices, the specification estimated is as follows
(the other equations are set up analogously):

i,t–j + mi + lt + υit ,

in which the subscript i denotes the ith country and the subscript t
denotes the tth year. As before, the estimated effects in years t + j, for
j = 0, 1, and 2, are then based on the estimates of the βj coefficients.

EXCHANGE RATES AND TRADE FLOWS: DISCONNECTED?

Given that some regions are likely to have experienced greater structural change than others, the
analysis investigates the evolution of trade elasticities
for a global sample and for separate regions. In particular, because the rise of global value chains has been
particularly noticeable in a number of Asian and European economies, rolling regression results are provided
separately for these two regions.
The results suggest that exchange rates have not
generally become disconnected from trade (Figure 3.8).
The elasticity of imports with respect to import prices
shows some weakening toward the end of the sample
in some of the regions, which is consistent with the
view that imports are increasingly responsive to export
developments, as in global value chains. However,
because there is no sign of weakening in the responsiveness of exports to relative export prices (there is
even a mild strengthening in some subsamples), or in
the effects of exchange rates on trade prices, the evidence regarding the implications of the rise of global
value chains remains inconclusive. Given that the rise
of global value chains has generally been only gradual
and appears to have decelerated recently, this inconclusive evidence is perhaps not surprising.43
Structural-break tests for a number of different
samples confirm this finding of broad stability in total
trade elasticities over time. When the sample used
for the estimation of the panel regressions is divided
into two halves—years through 2001 and years since
2002—a structural-break test fails to reject the null
hypothesis of no change in the trade elasticities across
the two time periods in most cases (Annex Table
3.5.1). The tests are conducted for the geographical
groups included in Figure 3.8, as well as for a sample
of economies that increased their participation in
global value chains particularly strongly (those with
a rise during 1995–2009 in the share of foreign
value added in gross exports that is greater than the
cross-country median), and for those economies that
Long-term effects are estimated as S2j=0 bj /(1 – r). The estimated
equation also includes a full set of time dummies (lt) to take account
of global shocks such as shifts in commodity prices. To avoid changes
in its composition over time, the sample includes only economies for
which at least 20 years of data are available. Based on data availability,
the full sample includes 88 advanced and emerging market and developing economies. They are listed in Annex Table 3.1.4.
43The finding of broad stability in exchange rate pass-through over
time is consistent with the findings of Bussière, Delle Chiaie, and
Peltonen (2014), who test stability in exchange rate pass-through
coefficients for the period 1990–2011 for 40 advanced and emerging
market and developing economies.

increased their participation less strongly (those with
a rise in the foreign-value-added share that is less than
the cross-country median).
Similarly inconclusive results emerge when the tests
are repeated for data samples used elsewhere, as in
the 46 economies included in the analysis of Ahmed,
Appendino, and Ruta 2015 (Annex 3.5). Additional
analysis suggests that evidence regarding a lengthening
of transmission lags is also limited. A lengthening in lags
would imply a divergence between long-term effects and
shorter-term effects, but there is little evidence of such a
divergence.
In interpreting these results, it is also worth noting
that the macroeconomic relevance of trade elasticities
depends on the shares of exports and imports in GDP,
both of which have risen in recent decades, reflecting the
process of trade globalization (Figure 3.9). On their own,
the increases in these trade ratios imply larger effects of
exchange rate movement on total imports and exports
in percentage points of GDP. Therefore, even a decline
in trade elasticities could, in the context of rising import
and export ratios, be consistent with exchange rate movements having equally important or even greater macroeconomic implications for trade than before.
Effects of Large Exchange Rate Depreciations over Time
To shed more light on whether the links between
exchange rates and trade have weakened, the analysis
reconsiders the effects of large exchange rate depreciations on exports in the first and second halves of the
sample. Of the 66 episodes of large currency depreciation in the sample, half (33) occurred in 1997 or earlier, and the other half occurred in more recent years.
Analysis of these two time samples indicates little
evidence of a weakening in the effects of exchange rates
over time (Figure 3.10). The analysis indicates that
export prices and volumes responded similarly during
the two time samples. Little evidence emerges of either
weakened long-term responses or lengthened lags.
Overall, the results are consistent with the view that
trade and exchange rates have remained connected.
It is worth recalling that the view that exchange rates
are becoming disconnected from trade has been partly
motivated by Japan’s recent experience; despite a sharp
depreciation of the yen, export growth has failed to
accelerate as expected. As discussed in Box 3.3, this
experience reflects a number of Japan-specific factors that have partly offset the positive impact of yen
depreciation on exports and that do not necessarily
apply elsewhere.

Implications for the Outlook
The analysis in this chapter suggests that exchange
rate movements tend to have strong effects on exports
and imports. Based on the chapter’s estimates, a 10
percent real effective depreciation in an economy’s
currency is associated with, on average, a 1.5 percent of GDP rise in real net exports, with substantial
cross-country variation around this average. It takes a
number of years for the effects to fully materialize, but

much of the adjustment occurs in the first year. The
analysis also indicates that foreign and domestic aggregate demand play robust roles in driving exports and
imports, a link that has featured prominently in the
policy debate on the postcrisis decline in global trade.
These results suggest that recent exchange rate
movements, including the U.S. dollar’s apprecia122

tion of more than 10 percent in real effective terms
during the past year, would result in a substantial
redistribution of real net exports across economies.
As discussed in Chapter 1, recent exchange rate
movements have reflected variations in underlying
fundamentals, such as expected demand growth at
home and in trading partners, declines in commodity prices, and a variety of country-specific shocks.
Overall outcomes for trade will reflect not only
the direct effect of exchange rates on trade, but
also shifts in the underlying fundamentals driving
exchange rates themselves. With regard to direct
effects on trade, the real effective exchange rate
movements since January 2013 point to a redistribution of real net exports, from the United States and
economies whose currencies move with the dollar,
to the euro area, to Japan, and to economies whose
currencies move with the euro and the yen (Figure
3.11).44 Among economies experiencing currency
depreciation, the rise in exports is likely to be greatest for those with slack in the domestic economy and
with financial systems operating normally.
The chapter also finds that there is little evidence
of a trend toward disconnect between exchange rates,
trade prices, and trade volumes over time. Some
evidence indicates that the rise of global value chains
has weakened the relationship between exchange rates
and trade in intermediate products used as inputs into
other economies’ exports. However, global-value-chainrelated trade has increased only gradually through the
decades, and the bulk of global trade still consists of
conventional trade. There is also little sign of a general
weakening in the responsiveness of exports to relative
export prices or in the effects of exchange rates on
trade prices. Overall, the evidence regarding a general
disconnect between exchange rates and overall trade
remains inconclusive.
Policy views based on the traditional relationship
between exchange rates and trade are thus still tenable. The results confirm that exchange rate changes
have strong effects on export and import prices, with
implications for inflation dynamics and the transmission of monetary policy changes. Economies in which
the rise of global value chains has weakened the effects
44The illustrative calculation reported in Figure 3.11 is based
solely on changes in real effective exchange rates from January 2013
to June 2015. The calculation is based on CPI-based real effective
exchange rates because they are available for more economies than
are PPI-based ones. It applies the average estimates of CPI-based
trade elasticities reported in Table 3.1 to all economies.

rates in facilitating the resolution of trade imbalances
remains strong.

index (CPI)–based real effective exchange rate also
comes from the INS. The producer price index (PPI)–
based real effective exchange rate, as well as the CPIbased and PPI-based trade-weighted foreign producer
prices, are constructed as trade-weighted indices, with
the weights from the INS. The unit labor cost data
come from OECD Statistics and, in case of missing
observations, are supplemented using IMF staff calculations. For non-OECD economies, the unit labor
cost is constructed as the total wage bill divided by real
GDP. The total wage bill and real GDP are taken from
the IMF’s WEO database, Haver Analytics, the International Labour Organization, the IMF’s International
Financial Statistics, and CEIC. When unavailable, total
wage bill data are constructed using the average wage
rate and total employment.

Annex 3.2. Estimation of Trade Elasticities
Trade Equations Estimated for Individual Economies
The analysis is based on log-linear specifications
for the four trade equations. For each equation, the
analysis checks whether the variables included are
cointegrated based on a Dickey-Fuller test, in which
case the equations are estimated using ordinary least
squares in levels. Otherwise, they are estimated in
first differences.
In level terms, the four trade equations estimated are
as follows. For export prices, the specification is

trade-weighted producer price index [PPI]), and —

For export volumes, the specification is

 

in which X denotes export volume and Y* denotes
foreign real GDP (in trade-weighted terms).46
46The estimates for the export price equation are also robust to the
inclusion of a foreign demand control on its specification.

For import prices, the specification is

ln Mt = a + b ln —– + g ln(DDt) + d ln(Xt ) + et ,
P t

 

in which DD denotes domestic demand for domestic
goods (Y – X ).
All equations also include a time trend and a
dummy variable (which equals 1 during 2008–09)
to account for the global financial crisis, and the
interaction of this crisis dummy with the measure of
foreign output for the export equation and with the
measure of domestic output for the import equation.
These interaction terms address the notion that trade
responded unusually strongly to demand during the
crisis (see, for example, Bussière and others 2013).
In addition, to control for shifts in global commodity prices, which can affect exporting firms’ costs, the
equations for export and import prices control for the
(log) indices of international fuel and nonfuel commodity prices. The estimates for the export price equation are also similar when trading-partner real GDP
growth is used as an additional control.
In each case, the estimate for b indicates the estimated long-term effect. Short-term effects are obtained
by estimating, in a second step, the equation in error
correction form. For example, for export prices, this
equation is

Annex 3.4. Analysis of Large Exchange
Rate Depreciation Episodes
List of Episodes
Annex Table 3.4.1 lists the 66 baseline large
exchange rate depreciation episodes used in the subsection “Insights from Large Exchange Rate Depreciation Episodes.” Annex Table 3.4.2 lists the additional
57 large exchange rate depreciation episodes that are
associated with banking crises.

Robustness Analysis
The baseline results for the effects of large exchange
rate depreciation episodes are compared with the
results based on the following three alternative
approaches. In each case, the results are similar to the
baseline results.
•• Alternative 1: Local projections method. In this exercise, the local projections method is used to estimate
the relationship between a large exchange rate depreciation and trade. As in Chapter 2, the methodology
used is the one first set out in Jordà 2005 and developed further in Teulings and Zubanov 2014. This
method provides a flexible alternative to traditional
vector autoregression (VAR) techniques. Unlike a
VAR, local projections are robust to misspecification of the data-generating process. (If the VAR is
misspecified, this specification error will be compounded at each horizon of the impulse response.)
The method uses separate regressions for the variable
of interest (the real effective exchange rate, export
prices, or export volumes) at different horizons.
The sequence of coefficient estimates for the various
horizons provides a nonparametric estimate of the
impulse response function. The estimated specification is as follows:

and time fixed effects, g th, to control for economic
developments facing a particular country in a given
year. Annex Figure 3.4.1 reports the estimation
results based on this approach, which are similar to
the baseline provided in Figure 3.4.
•• Alternative 2: Thresholds based on real effective
exchange rate depreciations. In this alternative, large
exchange rate depreciation episodes are identified
based on numeric thresholds taken from the statis-

128

International Monetary Fund | October 2015

tical distribution of the depreciation rate of the real
effective exchange rate, rather than of the currency
vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar. Using this identification
strategy, large exchange rate depreciation episodes
for advanced economies require two criteria: (1) a
real effective depreciation of at least 6 percent (the
90th percentile of all annual depreciation rates)
and (2) a change in the real effective depreciation that is at least 7 percentage points greater
than that in the previous year (the 90th percentile of all changes in annual depreciation rates).
For emerging market and developing economies,
the definition requires the same two criteria, but
with different threshold values: (1) a real effective
depreciation of at least 10 percent and (2) a change
in the real effective depreciation that is at least 12
percentage points higher than that in the previous
year. Annex Figure 3.4.2 reports the results of this
robustness test.
•• Alternative 3: Using Laeven and Valencia currency
crisis episodes. The analysis is repeated based on
the currency crisis episodes identified in Laeven
and Valencia 2013. Annex Figure 3.4.3 reports the
results of this robustness test.
The analysis in “Do Initial Economic Conditions Matter?” uses unusually low growth in the year
before the episode to measure initial economic slack.
Growth is defined as de-meaned real GDP growth
(for each economy, growth minus the economy’s
mean growth rate). Low growth is then defined as
de-meaned growth of less than the median for the 66
episodes (the median is near zero). As a robustness
check, the analysis is repeated with economic slack
defined based on the output gap one year before the
episode. The source of the output gap data is the
World Economic Outlook database. When this series
is missing, it is replaced with an output gap computed based on the Hodrick-Prescott filter applied to
real GDP with a smoothing parameter of 100. Episodes associated with economic slack are those having
an output gap that is less than the median for the
66 episodes (the median is near zero). Annex Figure
3.4.4 reports the estimation results for this robustness
test. The results for trade volumes continue to show
that exports rise more strongly when there is more
economic slack. The results for export prices, however, show no statistically distinguishable difference
between the two sets of initial economic conditions.

since 2002—and test the null hypothesis of no change

As Annex Table 3.5.1 reports, the tests fail to reject
the null of no change in most cases. Similarly inconclusive results emerge when the tests are repeated for

When the analysis is repeated for this sample of 46
economies, but export volumes are constructed by
deflating nominal exports using export prices rather
than the consumer price index (CPI)—as in that
study—there is little evidence of a decline in export
elasticities. (The CPI reflects the prices of many nontraded goods and services and increases on average
at a considerably higher rate than export prices.) The
same applies if outlier observations, including those
associated with spikes in CPI inflation, are removed
from the sample.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: ADJUSTING TO LOWER COMMODITY PRICES

Box 3.1. The Relationship between Exchange Rates and Global-Value-Chain-Related Trade
Global value chains have increased in prominence in
global production and trade. About one-third of world
trade consists of intermediate products for subsequent
reexport in a transformed state. This process contrasts
with the traditional view of international trade, in
which goods are produced in their entirety within a
single country and shipped as final goods to export markets. Given that within a global value chain, imports
are inputs into the production of exports, and imports
(which represent foreign value added) are complements
in production with domestic value added, globalvalue-chain-related trade may respond differently than
trade in final goods to exchange rate changes. Using
a recently released data set on trade in value added,
this box assesses how global value chains affect the
responses of different types of exports and imports and
the overall trade balance to changes in exchange rates.1
Moreover, this approach isolates the impact of exchange
rate changes on domestic value added, the concept that
determines GDP and competitiveness, and one that is
of ultimate concern to policymakers.
Before turning to the main question at hand, exploring the trade data is useful. As shown in Figure 3.1.1,
gross exports comprise exports produced within a global
value chain as well as other, non–global value chain
exports. Gross global value chain exports can, in turn,
be divided into domestic-value-added and foreign-valueadded components, both of which are subsequently
exported as inputs into the next stage of the supply
chain. In contrast, non–global value chain exports
consist primarily of domestic value added. Therefore,
gross exports consist of both domestic value added and
foreign value added. Gross imports encompass globalvalue-chain-related imports—which is the foreignvalue-added component of global-value-chain-related
exports—and non-global-value-chain-related imports.
Since foreign value added in global value chain exports
appears in both gross imports and exports, it has no
impact on the size of the trade balance. It is apparent
that global-value-chain-related gross exports (the sum of
domestic value added in global value chains and foreign
value added) grew substantially as a share of GDP in all

Co-operation and Development–World Trade Organization
Trade in Value Added database, which covers 57 countries, for
the years 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2008–09. The periodic data
are transformed to annual frequency, as discussed in Cheng and

countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
Nonetheless, non-global-value-chain-related exports
remain, on average, about two-thirds of world total
exported domestic value added.

The Exchange Rate Response of Global-Value-ChainRelated Trade
A panel framework with time and country fixed
effects is used to estimate the responsiveness of globalvalue-chain-related export and import volumes to
changes in real effective exchange rates (REERs).2 A
term for the interaction between the REER and the
share of foreign value added in gross global-valuechain-related exports is also included to capture the
dampening effect arising from a larger foreign-valueadded share. The interpretation of this term and its
corresponding coefficient is discussed later in this box.3
2The regressions are estimated using ordinary least squares. All
variables are expressed in natural logarithm levels. Value-added
trade weights are used to aggregate bilateral real exchange rates,
and the consumer price index (CPI) is used to deflate nominal
exchange rates. Real trade volumes are obtained by deflating
nominal volumes by the CPI. Controls include own and partner
country demand and others specified in the note to Table 3.1.1.
Note that in the global value chain import equation, partner—
rather than domestic—demand is used as a regressor to account
for the fact that the imports are intended for reexport and hence
depend on external demand conditions.
3Inclusion of this interaction term is grounded in a theoretical
model, available in Cheng and others, forthcoming.

The main findings of the analysis reported in Table
3.1.1 are as follows:
• A real appreciation not only reduces exports of
domestic value added (a conventional result), but
also lowers imports of foreign value added (contrary
to the traditional view). This latter result is consistent with the notion that global-value-chain-related
domestic value added and foreign value added are
complements in production, so producing and
exporting less domestic value added also reduces the
derived demand for imported foreign value added.
• A larger foreign-value-added share in gross globalvalue-chain-related exports tends to dampen the
response of domestic value added and foreign value
added to REER changes. This finding is shown by
the positive coefficients on the interaction between
REER and the foreign-value-added share in the
second row of Table 3.1.1. Intuitively, this result is
consistent with the notion that when a country’s own
domestic-value-added contribution in gross global
value chain exports is relatively small, a change in its
REER will have only a modest effect on the competitiveness of the entire supply chain, thereby muting
the domestic-value-added and foreign-value-added
responses to a change in the country’s own REER.
The dampening effect on global value chain
import and export elasticities from an increase in
the foreign-value-added share is illustrated in Figure
3.1.2. When the foreign-value-added share is very
small (corresponding to a large domestic-value-

added contribution), the spillover from a country’s
exchange rate depreciation onto the competitiveness
of the entire supply chain is correspondingly large.
Therefore, the elasticities are negative and close to
the “own effect” coefficients of row 1 of Table 3.1.1,
causing both global-value-chain-related domestic
value added and global-value-chain-related foreign
value added to increase. As the foreign-value-added
share rises—corresponding to a smaller own domestic-value-added contribution to the global value
chain—the spillover benefit from an own depreciation on the competitiveness of the entire supply
chain (second row in the table) declines, resulting in
smaller (negative) global value chain trade elasticities.
When the foreign-value-added share rises to 50–60
percent, the competitiveness benefit for the entire
supply chain from an own depreciation is neutralized
by the corresponding relative appreciation in global
value chain partners’ REERs, leading to zero import
and export elasticities. With even larger foreignvalue-added shares, import and export elasticities
can become positive, although the relevance of the

positive REER elasticity for global value chain trade
appears to be limited in practice.4
Overall, it is worth recalling that although global
value chain trade has grown considerably in recent
decades, conventional trade remains important—if not
dominant—at the global level. As additional analysis
confirms, even for countries in the sample with the
smallest domestic-value-added contributions and the
largest global value chain trade shares, a depreciation is
found to improve the real trade balance.

4The positive REER is irrelevant for two reasons. First, the
estimated export elasticities corresponding to foreign-value-added
shares of 50–80 percent lie within the 90 percent confidence
interval spanning zero, suggesting that the elasticities are not
statistically distinguishable from zero. For import elasticities, the
corresponding foreign-value-added share range is 38–62 percent,
but above this range, a positive elasticity cannot be rejected. Second, the maximum foreign-value-added contribution to globalvalue-chain-related gross exports for any country in the data set
is less than 80 percent, with the average foreign-value-added
share about 50–60 percent. Thus, most countries operate in the
range in which global value chain elasticities are about zero.

EXCHANGE RATES AND TRADE FLOWS: DISCONNECTED?

Box 3.2. Measuring Real Effective Exchange Rates and Competitiveness: The Role of Global Value Chains
The real effective exchange rate (REER) is a widely
used demand-based indicator of competitiveness.1
Standard theory postulates that countries produce
differentiated products and compete with one another
to sell their products on world markets, and demand
for products responds to relative prices. The rise of
global value chains poses a challenge to this conventional view as countries increasingly specialize in
adding value to a particular state of production rather
than producing entire finished products. This practice
means that countries compete to supply value added,
rather than supply gross exports, to world markets.
This box, therefore, discusses two main questions
related to the increased role of global value chains in
international trade:
• How does the rise of global value chains affect the
measurement of competitiveness and REERs?
• How do these new measures of competitiveness and
REERs differ from the conventional measures?
The rise of global value chains requires a rethinking of the relationship between exchange rates and
competitiveness. Consider, for example, the effect of a
yuan depreciation on China’s Asian trading partners.
According to the conventional view, yuan depreciation
unambiguously increases demand for Chinese goods
and lowers demand for goods produced elsewhere in
Asia. As a result, depreciations are beggar-thy-neighbor. When trade in inputs and specialization in stages
of production are prevalent, this conventional view
becomes incomplete. Because production in China
is linked to its Asian supply chain partners, the yuan
depreciation can make the supply chain’s final product
more competitive, stimulating demand for value added
at each stage of production. This outcome counterbalances the conventional beggar-thy-neighbor channel.
Which channel dominates is ultimately an empirical
matter.
Bems and Johnson (2015) present a model framework that extends the conventional demand-side
analysis to include supply-side linkages. The extended
framework incorporates two key features pertaining
to global value chains. First, by modeling intermediate production inputs, the framework distinguishes
between gross and value-added concepts in trade (in
The authors of this box are Rudolfs Bems and Marcos
Poplawski-Ribeiro.
1Competitiveness for the purposes of this box is defined as a
change in demand for a country’s output induced by changes in
international relative prices.

terms of both quantities and prices). Second, there are
two distinct margins of substitution (with potentially
differing elasticities): substitution in final demand
and substitution in production (between value added
and intermediate inputs or across inputs). The latter
captures substitution in supply chains.
The extended framework alters the conventional
link between exchange rates and competitiveness in
three important ways: different weights, different price
indices, and country-specific trade elasticities.

Different Weights
The weights used in the construction of these new
REER measures of Bems and Johnson (2015) depend
on both input-output linkages and relative elasticities
in production versus consumption. In contrast, conventional REER weights are constructed using gross
trade flows. Accounting for input-output linkages and
differences in elasticities can significantly alter REER
weights. Bilateral weights can even become negative,
if competitiveness gains for supply chain partners outweigh the beggar-thy-neighbor effects (as in the yuan
depreciation example earlier).
Figure 3.2.1 illustrates this general result by comparing REER weights that trading partners assign to
China and Germany. The figure includes three sets
of weights for each country: conventional consumer
price index (CPI)–based REER weights; input-output
REER (IOREER) weights, which account for both
input-output linkages and the variation in elasticities; and the intermediate case of value-added REER
(VAREER) weights that impose equal elasticities in
production and consumption.2
Consistent with standard intuition, neighboring
countries that trade a great deal with China, such as
Korea, Japan, and Malaysia, attach the largest weights
to China in the conventional CPI-based REER
indices.3 Relative to this benchmark, countries that
are integrated into the supply chains with China and
“Factory Asia” put less weight on China in the newly
proposed REER indices. VAREER weights are reduced
for China’s supply chain partners because value-added
trade flows, on which the VAREER is based, eliminate
2For VAREER weights Bems and Johnson (2015) show
that value-added trade flow data are sufficient for the weight
construction.
3These large weights reflect the fact that in conventional
macroeconomic analysis, large bilateral gross trade flows signify
intense head-to-head competition.

“round-tripping,” which is more prevalent within the
region. These weight shifts are further amplified when
production elasticities are relatively low, as captured
by the IOREER index. This is the case because low
production elasticities emphasize the role of substitution in final demand, as opposed to the within-region
substitution in supply chains. For some countries,
weights attached to China fall dramatically, with an
offsetting rise in weights elsewhere. For Vietnam, a
decline in Chinese prices actually raises Vietnamese
competitiveness in the IOREER case, as captured by
Vietnam’s negative IOREER weight.4

The basic insights from the Chinese example carry
over to the case of Germany, reported in panel 2 of
Figure 3.2.1. Conventional REER weights are largest
for Germany’s regional trading partners. The VAREER
and IOREER weights, relative to the conventional
ones, fall the most for the European Union accession
countries (the Czech Republic and Poland, for example) because of supply chain linkages. The magnitudes
of the weight changes can be substantial. For example,
moving from the conventional REER to the IOREER
roughly halves the weight that the Czech Republic
attaches to Germany.

Different Price Indices
By distinguishing between gross flows and value
added, the model framework provides clear guidance
on how to combine REER weights and prices to measure competitiveness, where prices need to be measured using GDP deflators. Figure 3.2.2 reports REER
changes during the 1990–2009 period, constructed
points lower in the IOREER index than in a conventional CPIbased REER index.

CHAPTER 3

EXCHANGE RATES AND TRADE FLOWS: DISCONNECTED?

Box 3.2 (continued)
using historical input-output data and observed
price changes for the period. IOREER indices can
differ substantially from conventional (CPI-based)
REER indices, both because of differences in weights
and because of different measures of price changes.5
However, over this long horizon (19 years), the bulk
of the divergence between the two REER indices
reflects persistent differences in the two price measures
(CPI and GDP deflators). At the same time, the two
measures of the REER are strongly correlated, partly
because the vast majority of trade does not consist
of global-value-chain-related trade.6 This observation
also implies that biases in estimated value-added trade
relations due to incorrectly using standard REERs are
likely to be small.

Country-Specific Trade Elasticities
Conventional measures of competitiveness rely on a
universal trade elasticity that translates effective price
developments into changes in economic activity and
hence competitiveness. In contrast, with two distinct
margins of substitution—final demand and production—trade elasticities in the extended framework
are country specific. If production is less responsive
to price changes than is final demand,7 countries that
5Bems and Johnson (2015) further show that value-added
exchange rates capture competitiveness developments missed by
conventional indices in important episodes.
6A regression of the IOREER measure on the CPI-based
REER yields a slope coefficient of 0.89 that is statistically significant at the 1 percent level.
7For example, in the case of the so-called Leontief production
function, in which there is no substitutability between production factors.

are more involved in global value chains (for example,
China), and hence trade more in intermediate inputs,
will in the aggregate exhibit lower trade elasticities
than countries that trade more in final consumption
goods (for example, the United States). In the latter
case, the more price-sensitive final demand is weighted
more heavily in the aggregate trade elasticity. One
implication is that with country-specific aggregate
trade elasticities, the REER index alone is an incomplete statistic for measuring competitiveness.8
Overall, global value chains change the measurement of competitiveness and REERs. Relative to the
conventional benchmark, global value chains change
both the weights and the prices that are used in the
construction of REER indices. Global value chains can
allow countries to benefit from improvements in the
competitiveness of supply chain partners, which can
counteract the standard beggar-thy-neighbor channel.
What do these findings mean for the relationship
between trade and exchange rate movements? On the
one hand, if production is less sensitive to relative
price changes than is final demand, aggregate trade
elasticities should be lower in countries that are more
integrated in global value chains. On the other hand,
if consumption is less price sensitive than is production, then countries that are more integrated into
global value chains should exhibit higher aggregate
trade elasticities.
8Furthermore, with the worldwide rise of global value chains,
value-added trade elasticities should decrease for the average
country over time. For a more in-depth discussion of the role of
value-added elasticities in the measurement of competitiveness,
see Bems and Johnson 2015.

Box 3.3. Japanese Exports: What’s the Holdup?
After rebounding from collapse during the global
financial crisis, real goods exports from Japan have
remained broadly flat during the past few years
despite a sharp depreciation of the yen since late
2012. Following aggressive monetary easing by
the Bank of Japan, the yen has depreciated by
about 35 percent in real effective terms during that
period. This depreciation has come after a sharp yen
appreciation from 2008 to 2011. So what explains
the subdued recovery of Japanese exports? This box
focuses on three interconnected explanations: lower
pass-through from exchange rates to export prices,
offshoring of production, and deeper involvement in
global value chains.

A Sluggish Export Recovery
The recent pace of export recovery in Japan is
much slower than could be expected based on the
usual response of exports to external demand and the
exchange rate. Exports are currently some 20 percent
below the level predicted by a standard export demand
equation estimated for the pre-Abenomics period
(Figure 3.3.1).1

Lower Pass-Through to Export Prices
Japanese exporters have long demonstrated pricingto-market behavior by maintaining the stability of
their export prices in overseas markets and absorbing
exchange rate fluctuations through profit margins. This
practice results in limited exchange rate pass-through
to export prices. Since the onset of yen depreciation
in 2012, export prices in yen have risen sharply, and
Japanese exporters’ profit margins have surged by some

1The export demand equation is based on an error correction model specification and is estimated on data from the first
quarter of 1980 through the third quarter of 2012:
DlnEXt = c + ∑4i=1 b1i DlnEXt–i + ∑4i=1 b2i DlnREERt–i
+ ∑4i=1 b3i DlnDt–i – g(lnEXt–1 – a1lnREERt–1
– a2lnDt–1) + et ,
in which EX denotes the export volume, REER denotes the real
effective exchange rate, and D is foreign demand—measured by
the weighted average of trading partners’ real GDP. The specification also includes dummy variables for the crisis (taking a value
of 1 from the third quarter of 2008 through the first quarter of
2009) and for the 2011 earthquake (taking a value of 1 in the
first and second quarters of 2011).

EXCHANGE RATES AND TRADE FLOWS: DISCONNECTED?

Box 3.3 (continued)
Analysis based on rolling regressions suggests that
exchange rate pass-through has declined from near
85 percent during the 1980s to about 50 percent in
recent years (Figure 3.3.2). In other words, a 10 percent yen depreciation reduced export prices by about
8.5 percent in the 1980s, but now reduces them by
only 5 percent.3 This observation suggests that if the
pass-through had remained at the level of the 1980s,
foreign export prices would have fallen by almost 30
percent since 2012, compared with the actual decline
of 17 percent. Based on the estimated price elasticity of exports, this larger decline, in turn, could have
boosted exports by an additional 6 percent.4 Note,
however, that in the medium term, exchange rate passthrough is likely to increase. Ree, Hong, and Choi
(2015) find that exchange rate pass-through to export
prices occurs over about five years in Japan, albeit not
to a full extent, which would imply stronger export
growth in the future.

Production Offshoring
During the past two decades, Japanese firms have
expanded abroad to exploit labor cost differentials and
rising demand in host countries. The pace of offshoring has accelerated since the global financial crisis,
arguably as a reflection of the sharp appreciation of the
yen in 2008–11 and uncertainty about the energy supply after the 2011 earthquake (Figure 3.3.3). Overseas
investment by Japanese subsidiaries now accounts
for about 25 percent of total manufacturing investment. Overseas sales––the sum of exports and sales
3The analysis is based on rolling regressions using the following specification and 10-year rolling windows with quarterly
data, starting with the window beginning in the first quarter of
1980 and ending in the fourth quarter of 1989:

DlnP tX = a + ∑4i=0 bi DlnNEERt–i + ∑4i=0 gi DlnCt–i
+ ∑4i=0 di DlnCPt–i ,

(3.3.1)

in which P tX stands for the export price index in foreign currency, Ct is the input cost index, and CPt is the competitors’
price index, which is proxied by trading partners’ GDP deflator. The sum of the coefficients on the exchange rate, S4i=0 bi,
corresponds to the pass-through rate of the nominal effective
exchange rate (NEER) to export prices in the destination country
after one year. Using the consumer price index and import price
index as alternative proxies for CPt and including more lags in
the regression yield similar results.
4The estimated one-year elasticity of exports to foreign export
prices used here is 0.5 and is obtained by reestimating the
exports equation while substituting export prices for the REER
terms.

by Japanese subsidiaries––have risen by more than 60
percent in value since 2011, which is much faster than
the growth rate for domestic exports (14 percent), and
now account for about 60 percent of total sales (Kang
and Piao 2015). This trend increase in investment and
sales overseas suggests that intrafirm trade has become
much more important. This finding could help explain
the decline in exchange rate pass-through, given that
intrafirm transactions are less subject to the impact of
exchange rate fluctuations.5
5There is evidence that Japanese intrafirm trade is largely
concentrated in the main exporting industries, such as trans-

by the share of overseas investment in total investment in Japan’s manufacturing sector. The resulting
out-of-sample forecasts come much closer to tracking
the observed flat performance of Japan’s exports since
2012 (Figure 3.3.3, panel 2). This result is consistent
with the view that increases in production offshoring
have decreased domestic exports, offsetting the positive
impact of the yen depreciation on exports.

To what extent does Japan’s lackluster export performance reflect this shift toward offshoring? To address
this question, the export model estimated is augmented to control for the degree of offshoring, proxied
portation equipment and electrical machinery, which have been
the most active in expanding overseas and accounted for almost
three-quarters of total overseas investment as of 2014. This type
of intrafirm trade involves exports of parts and components from
Japanese parent firms to their foreign affiliates. The products
produced or assembled by foreign affiliates in these industries
are either sold in local markets or shipped to unrelated buyers in
third-country markets. Therefore, the offshored production or
sales by Japanese firms has increasingly become a “substitute” for
domestic production or exports.

140

International Monetary Fund | October 2015

Japanese exports are dominated by high-value-added
products: electrical machinery, transportation equipment, and machinery, accounting for more than 60
percent of exports. These sectors are specialized, are
not easily substitutable, and are tightly connected to
global value chains.
During the past two decades, Japan has been increasingly involved in global value chains. According to the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development–World Trade Organization Trade in Value Added
(TiVA) database, foreign value added as a percentage of
Japan’s gross exports (backward participation) increased
between 1995 and 2009 from 6 percent to 11 percent
(Figure 3.7). Meanwhile, Japan has also become a
more important intermediate-input supplier for other
countries’ exports: domestically produced inputs used
in third countries’ exports (forward participation) rose
from 22 percent to 33 percent during the same period.
This places Japan among the countries experiencing
the largest increase in the forward-participation rate.
In addition, compared with other non-commodityexporting countries, Japan is more specialized in sectors
at the beginning of a value chain that are more intensive
in research and design, as shown by the TiVA data. As
Japan becomes more heavily involved in global value
chains and as global value chains become ever more
complex, exchange rate depreciation could be expected
to play a less important role in boosting export growth
of such global-value-chain-related goods.
Overall, the response of exports to the yen depreciation has been weaker than expected as a result
of a number of Japan-specific factors. In particular,
this weak response largely reflects the acceleration
in production offshoring since the global financial
crisis. It also reflects deeper involvement of Japanese
production and trade in global value chains and a
decline in the strength of the short-term exchange rate
pass-through.

STATISTICAL APPENDIX

T

he Statistical Appendix presents historical
data as well as projections. It comprises six
sections: Assumptions, What’s New, Data
and Conventions, Classification of Countries, Key Data Documentation, and Statistical Tables.
The assumptions underlying the estimates and projections for 2015–16 and the medium-term scenario
for 2017–20 are summarized in the first section. The
second section presents a brief description of the
changes to the database and statistical tables since
the April 2015 World Economic Outlook (WEO). The
third section provides a general description of the
data and the conventions used for calculating country
group composites. The classification of countries in
the various groups presented in the WEO is summarized in the fourth section. The fifth section provides
information on methods and reporting standards for
the member countries’ national account and government finance indicators included in the report.
The last, and main, section comprises the statistical
tables. (Statistical Appendix A is included here; Statistical Appendix B is available online.) Data in these
tables have been compiled on the basis of information
available through September 16, 2015. The figures
for 2015 and beyond are shown with the same degree
of precision as the historical figures solely for convenience; because they are projections, the same degree
of accuracy is not to be inferred.

Assumptions
Real effective exchange rates for the advanced economies are assumed to remain constant at their average
levels measured during the period July 27 to August
24, 2015. For 2015 and 2016, these assumptions imply
average U.S. dollar/special drawing right (SDR) conversion rates of 1.402 and 1.408, U.S. dollar/euro conversion rates of 1.113 and 1.118, and yen/U.S. dollar
conversion rates of 121.4 and 121.1, respectively.
It is assumed that the price of oil will average $51.62 a
barrel in 2015 and $50.36 a barrel in 2016.
Established policies of national authorities are
assumed to be maintained. The more specific policy

assumptions underlying the projections for selected
economies are described in Box A1.
With regard to interest rates, it is assumed that the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) on six-month U.S.
dollar deposits will average 0.4 percent in 2015 and 1.2
percent in 2016, that three-month euro deposits will average 0.0 percent in 2015 and 2016, and that six-month
yen deposits will average 0.1 percent in 2015 and 2016.
As a reminder, with respect to introduction of the euro,
on December 31, 1998, the Council of the European
Union decided that, effective January 1, 1999, the
irrevocably fixed conversion rates between the euro and
currencies of the member countries adopting the euro
are as follows:

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: ADJUSTING TO LOWER COMMODITY PRICES

What’s New
•• Data for Lithuania are now included in the euro area
aggregates, but they were excluded in the April 2015
WEO.
•• Projections for Greece are based on data available as of
August 12, 2015.
•• As in the April 2015 WEO, data for Syria are excluded
from 2011 onward because of the ongoing conflict and
the related lack of data.

Data and Conventions
Data and projections for 189 economies form the
statistical basis of the WEO database. The data are
maintained jointly by the IMF’s Research Department
and regional departments, with the latter regularly
updating country projections based on consistent
global assumptions.
Although national statistical agencies are the
ultimate providers of historical data and definitions,
international organizations are also involved in statistical issues, with the objective of harmonizing methodologies for the compilation of national statistics,
including analytical frameworks, concepts, definitions,
classifications, and valuation procedures used in the
production of economic statistics. The WEO database
reflects information from both national source agencies
and international organizations.
Most countries’ macroeconomic data presented in
the WEO conform broadly to the 1993 version of the
System of National Accounts (SNA). The IMF’s sector
statistical standards—the sixth edition of the Balance of
Payments and International Investment Position Manual
(BPM6), the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual
(MFSM 2000), and the Government Finance Statistics
Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001)—have been or are being
aligned with the SNA 2008.1 These standards reflect
the IMF’s special interest in countries’ external positions, financial sector stability, and public sector fiscal
positions. The process of adapting country data to the
new standards begins in earnest when the manuals are
released. However, full concordance with the manuals
is ultimately dependent on the provision by national
statistical compilers of revised country data; hence,
1Many countries are implementing the SNA 2008 or ESA 2010,
and a few countries use versions of the SNA older than 1993. A
similar adoption pattern is expected for the BPM6. Please refer to
Table G, which lists the statistical standards adhered to by each
country.

144

International Monetary Fund | October 2015

the WEO estimates are only partially adapted to these
manuals. Nonetheless, for many countries the impact,
on major balances and aggregates, of conversion to the
updated standards will be small. Many other countries
have partially adopted the latest standards and will
continue implementation over a period of years.
Composite data for country groups in the WEO are
either sums or weighted averages of data for individual
countries. Unless noted otherwise, multiyear averages
of growth rates are expressed as compound annual rates
of change.2 Arithmetically weighted averages are used
for all data for the emerging market and developing
economies group except data on inflation and money
growth, for which geometric averages are used. The
following conventions apply:
•• Country group composites for exchange rates, interest rates, and growth rates of monetary aggregates
are weighted by GDP converted to U.S. dollars at
market exchange rates (averaged over the preceding
three years) as a share of group GDP.
•• Composites for other data relating to the domestic economy, whether growth rates or ratios, are
weighted by GDP valued at purchasing power parity
as a share of total world or group GDP.3
•• Unless noted otherwise, composites for all sectors
for the euro area are corrected for reporting discrepancies in intra-area transactions. Annual data are not
adjusted for calendar-day effects. For data prior to
1999, data aggregations apply 1995 European currency unit exchange rates.
•• Composites for fiscal data are sums of individual

average market exchange rates in the years indicated.
•• Composite unemployment rates and employment
growth are weighted by labor force as a share of
group labor force.
•• Composites relating to external sector statistics are
sums of individual country data after conversion to

2Averages for real GDP and its components, employment, GDP
per capita, inflation, factor productivity, trade, and commodity
prices are calculated based on the compound annual rate of change,
except in the case of the unemployment rate, which is based on the
simple arithmetic average.
3See “Revised Purchasing Power Parity Weights” in the July 2014
WEO Update for a summary of the revised purchasing-power-paritybased weights, as well as Box A2 of the April 2004 WEO and Annex
IV of the May 1993 WEO. See also Anne-Marie Gulde and Marianne Schulze-Ghattas, “Purchasing Power Parity Based Weights for
the World Economic Outlook,” in Staff Studies for the World Economic
Outlook (Washington: International Monetary Fund, December

in the years indicated for balance of payments data
and at end-of-year market exchange rates for debt
denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars.
•• Composites of changes in foreign trade volumes and
prices, however, are arithmetic averages of percent
changes for individual countries weighted by the
U.S. dollar value of exports or imports as a share
of total world or group exports or imports (in the
preceding year).
•• Unless noted otherwise, group composites are computed if 90 percent or more of the share of group
weights is represented.
Data refer to calendar years, except in the case of a few
countries that use fiscal years. Please refer to Table F,
which lists the economies with exceptional reporting
periods for national accounts and government finance
data for each country.
For some countries, the figures for 2014 and earlier
are based on estimates rather than actual outturns. Please
refer to Table G, which lists the latest actual outturns for
the indicators in the national accounts, prices, government finance, and balance of payments indicators for
each country.

Classification of Countries
Summary of the Country Classification
The country classification in the WEO divides the
world into two major groups: advanced economies
and emerging market and developing economies.4 This
classification is not based on strict criteria, economic
or otherwise, and it has evolved over time. The objective is to facilitate analysis by providing a reasonably
meaningful method of organizing data. Table A provides an overview of the country classification, showing
the number of countries in each group by region and
summarizing some key indicators of their relative size
(GDP valued by purchasing power parity, total exports
of goods and services, and population).
Some countries remain outside the country classification and therefore are not included in the analysis.
Anguilla, Cuba, the Democratic People’s Republic of
Korea, and Montserrat are examples of countries that
are not IMF members, and their economies therefore
4As used here, the terms “country” and “economy” do not always
refer to a territorial entity that is a state as understood by international law and practice. Some territorial entities included here are
not states, although their statistical data are maintained on a separate
and independent basis.

are not monitored by the IMF. Somalia is omitted
from the emerging market and developing economies
group composites because of data limitations.

General Features and Composition of
Groups in the World Economic Outlook
Classification
Advanced Economies
The 37 advanced economies are listed in Table B.
The seven largest in terms of GDP based on market
exchange rates—the United States, Japan, Germany,
France, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Canada—constitute the subgroup of major advanced economies often
referred to as the Group of Seven (G7). The members
of the euro area are also distinguished as a subgroup.
Composite data shown in the tables for the euro area
cover the current members for all years, even though
the membership has increased over time.
Table C lists the member countries of the European
Union, not all of which are classified as advanced
economies in the WEO.

Emerging Market and Developing Economies
The group of emerging market and developing
economies (152) includes all those that are not classified as advanced economies.
The regional breakdowns of emerging market and
developing economies are Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), emerging and developing Asia, emerging and developing Europe (sometimes also referred to
as “central and eastern Europe”), Latin America and the
Caribbean (LAC), Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan, and Pakistan (MENAP), and sub-Saharan Africa
(SSA).
Emerging market and developing economies are also
classified according to analytical criteria. The analytical criteria reflect the composition of export earnings
and a distinction between net creditor and net debtor
economies. The detailed composition of emerging
market and developing economies in the regional and
analytical groups is shown in Tables D and E.
The analytical criterion source of export earnings
distinguishes between categories fuel (Standard International Trade Classification [SITC] 3) and nonfuel and
then focuses on nonfuel primary products (SITCs 0, 1,
2, 4, and 68). Economies are categorized into one of
these groups when their main source of export earnings

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: ADJUSTING TO LOWER COMMODITY PRICES

exceeded 50 percent of total exports on average between
2010 and 2014.
The financial criteria focus on net creditor economies,
net debtor economies, heavily indebted poor countries
(HIPCs), and low-income developing countries (LIDCs).
Economies are categorized as net debtors when their
latest net international investment position, where
available, was less than zero or their current account
balance accumulations from 1972 (or earliest available
data) to 2014 were negative. Net debtor economies are
further differentiated on the basis of experience with debt
servicing.5
The HIPC group comprises the countries that are or
have been considered by the IMF and the World Bank
for participation in their debt initiative known as the
5 During

2010–14, 19 economies incurred external payments
arrears or entered into official or commercial bank debt-rescheduling
agreements. This group is referred to as economies with arrears and/or
rescheduling during 2010–14.

HIPC Initiative, which aims to reduce the external debt
burdens of all the eligible HIPCs to a “sustainable” level
in a reasonably short period of time.6 Many of these
countries have already benefited from debt relief and
have graduated from the initiative.
The LIDCs are countries that were designated as
eligible to use the IMF’s concessional financing resources
under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT)
in the 2013 PRGT eligibility review and had a level of
per capita gross national income less than the PRGT
income graduation threshold for non–small states (that
is, twice the World Bank International Development
Association operational threshold, or US$2,390 in 2011
as measured by the World Bank’s Atlas method) and
Zimbabwe.

STATISTICAL APPENDIX

Box A1. Economic Policy Assumptions Underlying the Projections for Selected Economies
Fiscal Policy Assumptions
The short-term fiscal policy assumptions used in the
World Economic Outlook (WEO) are based on officially
announced budgets, adjusted for differences between
the national authorities and the IMF staff regarding
macroeconomic assumptions and projected fiscal outturns. The medium-term fiscal projections incorporate
policy measures that are judged likely to be implemented. For cases in which the IMF staff has insufficient information to assess the authorities’ budget
intentions and prospects for policy implementation,
an unchanged structural primary balance is assumed
unless indicated otherwise. Specific assumptions used
in regard to some of the advanced economies follow.
(See also Tables B5 to B9 in the online section of the
Statistical Appendix for data on fiscal net lending/borrowing and structural balances.)1
Argentina: Fiscal projections are based on the available information regarding budget outturn for the
federal government and budget plans for provinces
and on IMF staff macroeconomic projections.
Australia: Fiscal projections are based on Australian
Bureau of Statistics data, the 2015–16 budget documents,
and IMF staff estimates.
Austria: For 2014, the creation of a defeasance
structure for Hypo Alpe Adria is assumed to increase
the general-government-debt-to-GDP ratio by 4.3
percentage points, and the deficit effect arising from
Hypo is assumed to be 1.4 percentage points.
Belgium: Projections reflect the authorities’ 2015
budget (updated for new developments) and the
2015–18 Stability Programme objectives, adjusted

1 The output gap is actual minus potential output, as a
percentage of potential output. Structural balances are expressed
as a percentage of potential output. The structural balance is the
actual net lending/borrowing minus the effects of cyclical output
from potential output, corrected for one-time and other factors,
such as asset and commodity prices and output composition
effects. Changes in the structural balance consequently include
effects of temporary fiscal measures, the impact of fluctuations
in interest rates and debt-service costs, and other noncyclical
fluctuations in net lending/borrowing. The computations of
structural balances are based on IMF staff estimates of potential
GDP and revenue and expenditure elasticities. (See Annex I of
the October 1993 WEO.) Net debt is calculated as gross debt
minus financial assets corresponding to debt instruments. Estimates of the output gap and of the structural balance are subject
to significant margins of uncertainty.

for differences in the IMF staff’s macroeconomic
framework.
Brazil: For 2014, outturn estimates are based on the
information available as of February 2015. Projections for 2015 take into account budget performance
until April 2015, adjustment measures approved by
the Congress and the Senate through May 2015, and
the budget freeze (contingeciamento) announced by the
government at the end of May 2015. In outer years,
projections are consistent with the announced primary
surplus objectives.
Canada: Projections use the baseline forecasts in the
Economic Action Plan 2015 and 2015 provincial budgets as available. The IMF staff makes adjustments to
this forecast for differences in macroeconomic projections. The IMF staff forecast also incorporates the most
recent data releases from Statistics Canada’s Canadian
System of National Economic Accounts, including
federal, provincial, and territorial budgetary outturns
through the end of the second quarter of 2015.
Chile: Projections are based on the authorities’
budget projections, adjusted to reflect the IMF staff’s
projections for GDP and copper prices.
China: The pace of fiscal consolidation is likely to
be more gradual, reflecting reforms to strengthen social
safety nets and the social security system announced as
part of the Third Plenum reform agenda.
Denmark: Projections for 2014–15 are aligned with
the latest official budget estimates and the underlying economic projections, adjusted where appropriate
for the IMF staff’s macroeconomic assumptions. For
2016–20, the projections incorporate key features
of the medium-term fiscal plan as embodied in the
authorities’ 2014 Convergence Programme submitted
to the European Union (EU).
France: Projections for 2015 reflect the budget law.
For 2016–17, they are based on the multiyear budget
and the April 2015 Stability Programme, adjusted for
differences in assumptions on macro and financial
variables, and revenue projections. Historical fiscal data
reflect the statistical institute’s May 2015 revision and
update of the fiscal accounts and national accounts.
Germany: The IMF staff’s projections for 2015 and
beyond reflect the authorities’ adopted core federal
government budget plan and the German Stability
Programme: 2015 Update, adjusted for the differences
in the IMF staff’s macroeconomic framework. The
estimate of gross debt includes portfolios of impaired

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: ADJUSTING TO LOWER COMMODITY PRICES

Box A1 (continued)
assets and noncore business transferred to institutions
that are winding up, as well as other financial sector
and EU support operations.
Greece: The fiscal projections for 2015 and the
medium term are IMF staff estimates based on the
fiscal package included in the European Stability
Mechanism program agreed between Greece and its
European partners and on information available as of
August 12, 2015.
Hong Kong SAR: Projections are based on the authorities’ medium-term fiscal projections on expenditures.
Hungary: Fiscal projections include IMF staff projections of the macroeconomic framework and of the
impact of recent legislative measures, as well as fiscal
policy plans announced in the 2015 budget.
India: Historical data are based on budgetary execution data. Projections are based on available information on the authorities’ fiscal plans, with adjustments
for IMF staff assumptions. Subnational data are
incorporated with a lag of up to two years; general
government data are thus finalized well after central
government data. IMF and Indian presentations differ,
particularly regarding divestment and license auction
proceeds, net versus gross recording of revenues in certain minor categories, and some public sector lending.
Indonesia: IMF projections are based on moderate
tax policy and administration reforms, fuel subsidy
pricing reforms introduced in January 2015, and a
gradual increase in social and capital spending over the
medium term in line with fiscal space.
Ireland: Fiscal projections are based on the 2015
budget, adjusted for differences between the IMF
staff’s macroeconomic projections and those of the
Irish authorities.
Italy: IMF staff estimates and projections are based
on the fiscal plans included in the government’s 2015
Budget, April 2015 Economic and Financial Document, and subsequently approved measures. Estimates
of the cyclically adjusted balance include the expenditures to clear capital arrears in 2013, which are
excluded from the structural balance. After 2015, the
IMF staff projects convergence to a structural balance
in line with Italy’s fiscal rule, which implies corrective
measures in some years, as yet unidentified.
Japan: The projections include fiscal measures
already announced by the government, including
consumption tax increases, earthquake reconstruction
spending, and the stimulus package.

164

International Monetary Fund | October 2015

Korea: The medium-term forecast incorporates the
government’s announced medium-term consolidation
path.
Mexico: Fiscal projections for 2015 are broadly in
line with the approved budget; projections for 2016
onward assume compliance with rules established in
the Fiscal Responsibility Law.
Netherlands: Fiscal projections for the period
2015–20 are based on the authorities’ Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis budget projections, after differences in macroeconomic assumptions are adjusted for.
Historical data were revised following the June 2014
Central Bureau of Statistics release of revised macro
data because of the adoption of the European System
of National and Regional Accounts (ESA 2010) and
the revisions of data sources.
New Zealand: Fiscal projections are based on the
authorities’ 2015–16 budget documents and on IMF
staff estimates.
Portugal: For 2014, the general government fiscal
balance does not include a one-off transaction arising
from banking support, pending a decision on statistical
classification by the Instituto Nacional de Estatística
(INE)/Eurostat. The projection for 2015 reflects the
authorities’ 2015 budget and first-half outturn; projections thereafter are based on IMF staff’s macroeconomic
forecast, under the assumption of unchanged policies.
Russia: Projections for 2015–20 are based on the
oil-price-based fiscal rule introduced in December
2012, with adjustments by the IMF staff.
Saudi Arabia: IMF staff projections of oil revenues are based on WEO baseline oil prices. On
the expenditure side, wage bill estimates incorporate
13th-month pay awards every three years in accordance with the lunar calendar; projections assume
that, to adjust to lower oil prices, capital spending
falls as a percentage of GDP over the medium term as
large-scale projects currently being implemented are
completed and that spending in the January and April
2015 fiscal packages is not repeated.
Singapore: For fiscal years 2014/15 and 2015/16,
projections are based on budget numbers. For the
remainder of the projection period, the IMF staff
assumes unchanged policies.
South Africa: Fiscal projections are based on the
authorities’ 2015 Budget Review.
Spain: For 2015 and beyond, fiscal projections
are based on the measures specified in the Stabil-

STATISTICAL APPENDIX

Box A1 (continued)
ity Programme Update 2014–17, the 2015 budget
plan issued in October 2014, and the 2015 budget
approved in December 2014.
Sweden: Fiscal projections take into account the
authorities’ projections based on the Spring Fiscal
Policy Bill 2015. The impact of cyclical developments
on the fiscal accounts is calculated using the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s
2005 elasticity to take into account output and
employment gaps.
Switzerland: The projections assume that fiscal
policy is adjusted as necessary to keep fiscal balances
in line with the requirements of Switzerland’s fiscal
rules.
Turkey: Fiscal projections assume that both current
and capital spending will be in line with the authorities’ 2014–16 Medium Term Programme based on
current trends and policies.
United Kingdom: Fiscal projections are based on the
U.K. Treasury’s 2015 Summer Budget, published in
July 2015. However, on the revenue side, the authorities’ projections are adjusted for differences between
IMF staff forecasts of macroeconomic variables (such
as GDP growth) and the forecasts of these variables
assumed in the authorities’ fiscal projections. IMF
staff data exclude public sector banks and the effect of
transferring assets from the Royal Mail Pension Plan
to the public sector in April 2012. Real government
consumption and investment are part of the real GDP
path, which, according to the IMF staff, may or may
not be the same as projected by the U.K. Office for
Budget Responsibility.
United States: Fiscal projections are based on the
August 2015 Congressional Budget Office baseline
adjusted for the IMF staff’s policy and macroeconomic assumptions. The baseline incorporates the
key provisions of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013,
including a partial rollback of the sequester spending
cuts in fiscal years 2014 and 2015. The rollback is
fully offset by savings elsewhere in the budget. In fiscal years 2016 through 2021, the IMF staff assumes
that the sequester cuts will continue to be partially
replaced, in proportions similar to those agreed
upon under the Bipartisan Budget Act for fiscal years
2014 and 2015, with back-loaded measures generating savings in mandatory programs and additional
revenues. Fiscal projections are adjusted to reflect
the IMF staff’s forecasts for key macroeconomic and

financial variables and different accounting treatment
of financial sector support and of defined-benefit
pension plans and are converted to a general government basis. Historical data start at 2001 for most
series because data compiled according to the 2001
Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM 2001)
may not be available for earlier years.

Monetary Policy Assumptions
Monetary policy assumptions are based on the established policy framework in each country. In most
cases, this implies a nonaccommodative stance over
the business cycle: official interest rates will increase
when economic indicators suggest that inflation
will rise above its acceptable rate or range; they will
decrease when indicators suggest that inflation will
not exceed the acceptable rate or range, that output
growth is below its potential rate, and that the margin of slack in the economy is significant. On this
basis, the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)
on six-month U.S.-dollar deposits is assumed to
average 0.4 percent in 2015 and 1.2 percent in 2016
(see Table 1.1). The rate on three-month euro deposits is assumed to average 0.0 percent in 2015 and
2016. The interest rate on six-month Japanese yen
deposits is assumed to average 0.1 percent in 2015
and 2016.
Australia: Monetary policy assumptions are in line
with market expectations.
Brazil: Monetary policy assumptions are consistent
with gradual convergence of inflation toward the
middle of the target range over the relevant horizon.
Canada: Monetary policy assumptions are in line
with market expectations.
China: Monetary policy will remain broadly
unchanged from its current status, consistent with
the authorities’ announcement of maintaining stable
economic growth.
Denmark: The monetary policy is to maintain the
peg to the euro.
Euro area: Monetary policy assumptions for euro
area member countries are in line with market
expectations.
Hong Kong SAR: The IMF staff assumes that the
currency board system remains intact.
India: The policy (interest) rate assumption is consistent with an inflation rate within the Reserve Bank
of India’s targeted band.

International Monetary Fund | October 2015

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: ADJUSTING TO LOWER COMMODITY PRICES

Box A1 (continued)
Indonesia: Monetary policy assumptions are in line
with a reduction of inflation to within the central
bank’s targeted band by the end of 2015.
Japan: The current monetary policy conditions are
maintained for the projection period, and no further
tightening or loosening is assumed.
Korea: Monetary policy assumptions are in line with
market expectations.
Mexico: Monetary assumptions are consistent with
attaining the inflation target.
Russia: Monetary projections assume increasing
exchange rate flexibility as part of the transition to
the new full-fledged inflation-targeting regime, as
indicated in recent statements by the Central Bank of
Russia. Specifically, policy rates are assumed to remain
at the current levels, gradually reducing the number of
interventions in the foreign exchange markets.
Saudi Arabia: Monetary policy projections are based
on the continuation of the exchange rate peg to the
U.S. dollar.

166

International Monetary Fund | October 2015

Singapore: Broad money is projected to grow in line
with the projected growth in nominal GDP.
South Africa: Monetary projections are consistent
with South Africa’s 3–6 percent inflation target range.
Sweden: Monetary projections are in line with Riksbank projections.
Switzerland: Monetary policy variables reflect historical data from the national authorities and the market.
Turkey: Broad money and the long-term bond yield
are based on IMF staff projections. The short-term
deposit rate is projected to evolve with a constant
spread against the interest rate of a similar U.S.
instrument.
United Kingdom: Projections assume no change in
monetary policy or the level of asset purchases until
2016, consistent with market expectations.
United States: With employment conditions improving but wage growth yet to exert significant price
pressure, the IMF staff expects the federal funds target
to remain near zero until the end of 2015.

1Data for some countries refer to real net material product (NMP) or are estimates based on NMP. The figures should be interpreted only as indicative of broad orders of magnitude because
reliable, comparable data are not generally available. In particular, the growth of output of new private enterprises of the informal economy is not fully reflected in the recent figures.
2Georgia, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine, which are not members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, are included in this group for reasons of geography and similarity in economic
structure.
3Data are based on the 2008 System of National Accounts. The revised national accounts data are available beginning in 2000 and exclude Crimea and Sevastopol from 2010 onward.
4In this table only, the data for Timor-Leste are based on non-oil GDP.
5The data for Argentina are officially reported data as revised in May 2014. On February 1, 2013, the IMF issued a declaration of censure, and in December 2013 called on Argentina to
implement specified actions to address the quality of its official GDP data according to a specified timetable. On June 3, 2015, the Executive Board recognized the ongoing discussions with
the Argentine authorities and their material progress in remedying the inaccurate provision of data since 2013, but found that some specified actions called for by the end of February 2015
had not yet been completely implemented. The Executive Board will review this issue again by July 15, 2016, and in line with the procedures set forth in the IMF legal framework.
6For Iran, data and forecasts are based on GDP at market prices. Corresponding data used by the IMF staff for GDP growth at factor prices are 3.0 percent, –1.9 percent, and –6.8 percent
for 2014/15, 2013/14, and 2012/13, respectively.
7Data for 2011 exclude South Sudan after July 9. Data for 2012 and onward pertain to the current Sudan.
8Data for Syria are excluded for 2011 onward because of the ongoing conflict and related lack of data.
9The Zimbabwe dollar ceased circulating in early 2009. Data are based on IMF staff estimates of price and exchange rate developments in U.S. dollars. IMF staff estimates of U.S. dollar
values may differ from authorities’ estimates. Real GDP is in constant 2009 prices.

in consumer prices are shown as annual averages.
year-over-year changes and, for several countries, on a quarterly basis.
3For many countries, inflation for the earlier years is measured on the basis of a retail price index. Consumer price index (CPI) inflation data with broader and more up-to-date coverage are
typically used for more recent years.
4Georgia, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine, which are not members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, are included in this group for reasons of geography and similarity in economic
structure.
5Starting in 2014 data exclude Crimea and Sevastopol.
6Consumer price data from December 2013 onward reflect the new national CPI (IPCNu), which differs substantively from the preceding CPI (the CPI for the Greater Buenos Aires Area, CPIGBA). Because of the differences in geographical coverage, weights, sampling, and methodology, the IPCNu data cannot be directly compared to the earlier CPI-GBA data. Because of this
structural break in the data, the average CPI inflation for 2014 is not reported in the October 2015 World Economic Outlook. Following a declaration of censure by the IMF on February 1, 2013,
the public release of a new national CPI by the end of March was one of the specified actions in the IMF Executive Board’s December 2013 decision calling on Argentina to address the quality of
its official CPI data. On June 3, 2015, the Executive Board recognized the ongoing discussions with the Argentine authorities and their material progress in remedying the inaccurate provision of
data since 2013, but found that some specified actions called for by the end of February 2015 had not yet been completely implemented. The Executive Board will review this issue again by July
15, 2016, and in line with the procedures set forth in the IMF legal framework.
7Data for 2011 exclude South Sudan after July 9. Data for 2012 and onward pertain to the current Sudan.
8Data for Syria are excluded for 2011 onward because of the ongoing conflict and related lack of data.
9The Zimbabwe dollar ceased circulating in early 2009. Data are based on IMF staff estimates of price and exchange rate developments in U.S. dollars. IMF staff estimates of U.S. dollar values
may differ from authorities’ estimates.

Note: The methodology and specific assumptions for each country are discussed in Box A1. The country group composites for fiscal data are calculated as the sum of the U.S. dollar
values for the relevant individual countries.
1Debt data refer to the end of the year and are not always comparable across countries. Gross and net debt levels reported by national statistical agencies for countries that have
adopted the System of National Accounts (SNA) 2008 (Australia, Canada, Hong Kong SAR, United States) are adjusted to exclude unfunded pension liabilities of government employees’
defined-benefit pension plans. Fiscal data for the aggregated Major Advanced Economies and the United States start in 2001, and the average for the aggregate and the United States is
therefore for the period 2001–07.
2Percent of potential GDP.
3Figures reported by the national statistical agency are adjusted to exclude items related to the accrual-basis accounting of government employees defined-benefit pension plans.
4Data for Lithuania are included in the euro area aggregates but were excluded in the April 2015 World Economic Outlook.
5Excludes one-time measures based on the authorities’ data and, in the absence of the latter, receipts from the sale of assets.
6Includes equity shares; nonconsolidated basis.

1Georgia, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine, which are not members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, are included in this group for reasons of geography and similarity in economic
structure.
2Starting in 2014 data exclude Crimea and Sevastopol.
3Calculations are based on Argentina’s official GDP data. See note 5 to Table A4.
4Data for 2011 exclude South Sudan after July 9. Data for 2012 and onward pertain to the current Sudan.
5Data for Syria are excluded for 2011 onward because of the ongoing conflict and related lack of data.
6The Zimbabwe dollar ceased circulating in early 2009. Data are based on IMF staff estimates of price and exchange rate developments in U.S. dollars. IMF staff estimates of U.S. dollar
values may differ from authorities’ estimates.

Note: The estimates in this table are based on individual countries’ national accounts and balance of payments statistics. Country group composites are calculated as the sum of the U.S. dollar
values for the relevant individual countries. Some group aggregates for the financial derivatives are not shown because of incomplete data. Projections for the euro area are not available because
of data constraints.
1Data for Lithuania are included in the euro area aggregates but were excluded in the April 2015 World Economic Outlook.
2Excludes the G7 (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, United States) and euro area countries.
3Georgia, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine, which are not members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, are included in this group for reasons of geography and similarity in economic
structure.

Note: The estimates in this table are based on individual countries’ national accounts and balance of payments statistics. Country group composites are calculated as the sum of the U.S.
dollar values for the relevant individual countries. This differs from the calculations in the April 2005 and earlier issues of the World Economic Outlook, in which the composites were
weighted by GDP valued at purchasing power parities as a share of total world GDP. The estimates of gross national savings and investment (or gross capital formation) are from individual
countries’ national accounts statistics. The estimates of the current account balance, the capital account balance, and the financial account balance (or net lending/net borrowing) are
from the balance of payments statistics. The link between domestic transactions and transactions with the rest of the world can be expressed as accounting identities. Savings (S ) minus
investment (I ) is equal to the current account balance (CAB ) (S – I = CAB ). Also, net lending/net borrowing (NLB ) is the sum of the current account balance and the capital account
balance (KAB ) (NLB = CAB + KAB). In practice, these identities do not hold exactly; imbalances result from imperfections in source data and compilation as well as from asymmetries in
group composition due to data availability.
1Data for Lithuania are included in the euro area aggregates but were excluded in the April 2015 World Economic Outlook.
2Includes the G7 (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, United States) and euro area countries.
3Georgia, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine, which are not members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, are included in this group for reasons of geography and similarity in economic
structure.

IMF EXECUTIVE BOARD DISCUSSION OF THE OUTLOOK,
SEPTEMBER 2015

The following remarks were made by the Chair at the conclusion of the Executive Board’s discussion of the World
­Economic Outlook, Global Financial Stability Report, and Fiscal Monitor on September 21, 2015.

E

xecutive Directors broadly shared the assessment of global economic prospects and risks.
They noted that global growth remains modest
and uneven across countries and regions,
while financial market volatility has increased in recent
months. Downside risks to the global outlook have
risen, with emerging market and developing economies particularly exposed to the declining commodity
prices and tighter global financial conditions. Directors
observed that persistent weak growth in advanced economies and the fifth consecutive year of growth declines in
emerging market economies reflect both country-specific
developments and common forces of a medium- and
long-term nature. Forceful policy action on all fronts, as
well as enhanced international cooperation, has become
more crucial than ever to reverse this trend and promote
stronger, more balanced global growth.
Directors broadly concurred that, in advanced
economies, the foundations for a modest recovery
in 2015–16 are still intact, while financial stability
has generally improved. They noted that a sustained
recovery in the euro area, a return to positive growth
in Japan, and continued robust activity in the United
States are positive forces, although increased market
volatility may pose financial stability challenges in the
near term. Medium-term prospects remain subdued,
reflecting unfavorable demographics, weak productivity growth, and high unemployment, as well as legacy
issues from the crisis—including high indebtedness,
low investment, and financial sector weakness. A key
risk is a further decline of already-low growth that
could turn into near stagnation, especially if slower
growth in emerging market economies dampens global
demand. In this context, persistent below-target inflation could become more entrenched.
Directors noted that the overall outlook for emerging market and developing economies is generally
weakening, reflecting tighter global financial conditions, China’s transition toward consumption-driven

sustainable growth, a weaker commodity market outlook, and geopolitical tensions. However, growth prospects differ considerably across countries. Emerging
market economies are vulnerable to shifts in exchange
rates and a reversal of capital flows. Meanwhile,
further declines in commodity prices could weaken
the outlook for commodity exporters. While China’s
transition and the ensuing slowdown have long been
anticipated, a sharper-than-expected growth decline, if
it materialized, could generate considerable spillovers
and risks for other countries.
Directors acknowledged that the global financial
outlook is clouded by increased emerging market
vulnerabilities, legacy issues from the crisis in advanced
economies, and concerns about weak market liquidity. They noted in particular high corporate leverage
and foreign-currency exposures in emerging market
economies, headwinds from balance sheet weaknesses
in advanced economies, and remaining gaps in the
euro area financial architecture. In the context of rising
policy rates, the global financial system may see adjustment as financial conditions tighten and risk premiums
rise from historically low levels. Directors recognized
that interest rate normalization in the United States
driven by robust activity will benefit the world economy and also reduce uncertainty—and hence should
take place in a timely, data-dependent manner.
Directors underscored that raising both actual and
potential output continues to be a policy priority,
requiring mutually reinforcing measures for demand
support and structural reforms. They concurred that
the main policy recommendations are appropriate,
although the right balance of policy mix will vary from
country to country. A collective effort is needed to
boost trade growth, avoid trade protectionist measures,
refrain from competitive devaluations, and reduce the
persistent global imbalances.
Directors agreed with the policy priorities for
full employment and stable inflation in advanced

economies. Accommodative monetary policy remains
essential, particularly in Japan and the euro area, while
efforts should continue, where needed, to enhance
policy transmission and address financial system risks
through continued balance sheet repair and macroprudential policies. Fiscal policy should remain
prudent, yet flexible and growth friendly, anchored in
sound medium-term strategies. Countries with fiscal
space and sizable output gaps or significant current
account surpluses should ease their fiscal stance in
the near term, especially by increasing investment
in high-quality, high-return infrastructure projects.
Structural reforms should aim to strengthen labor force
participation and trend employment, facilitate labor
market adjustment, tackle legacy debt overhang, and
lower barriers to entry in product markets, especially in
services.
Directors recognized that emerging market and
developing economies in general are now better
prepared for the current, less favorable environment—with stronger fundamentals, buffers, and policy
frameworks. Nevertheless, they face a difficult trade-off
between supporting demand and reducing vulnerabilities. The scope for further easing macroeconomic
policies varies considerably across countries, depending
on the extent of economic slack and inflationary pressures and fiscal space, as well as external, financial, and
fiscal vulnerabilities. Directors agreed that exchange
rate flexibility, where feasible, in the context of a wellspecified policy framework, can help absorb external
shocks. They stressed that, in many countries, structural reforms are urgently needed to raise productivity
and remove bottlenecks to production.
Directors concurred that, in a more difficult external
environment, developments in low-income countries
should be given particular attention. Many of these
countries are commodity exporters whose initial conditions have already been strained, fiscal and external
balances are deteriorating, and absorptive capacity
is limited. Appropriate policy advice and adequate
financial assistance from development partners, including the Fund, will be essential to support low-income
countries in their adjustment efforts and advancement

toward the Sustainable Development Goals. Their
priorities generally include economic diversification,
domestic revenue mobilization, and financial sector
deepening.
Directors highlighted the importance of preserving
financial stability, safeguarding against market illiquidity, and maintaining confidence in policymaking. For
advanced economies, priorities should include continued clear and effective communication of monetary
policy intentions, and a comprehensive strategy to
tackle nonperforming loans and complete the financial
architecture in the euro area. Liquidity conditions,
especially for nonbanks, should be closely monitored,
and market structure solutions to liquidity shortages
should be explored. Completing the global financial
regulatory reform agenda requires further progress on
implementation, finalization of outstanding reforms,
and addressing emerging risks.
Directors emphasized the need to address both cyclical and structural challenges in emerging market economies. They agreed that policymakers should rely on
micro- and macro-prudential tools to discourage the
buildup of excessive leverage, strengthen provisioning
by banks, and improve regulations on credit quality
classification. Foreign-currency exposures warrant special attention and the reform of corporate insolvency
regimes should continue. Rebalancing and deleveraging
in China will require a careful pacing and sequencing
of market-based reforms, a further strengthening of
the financial system, and strong implementation of the
reform agenda.
Directors noted that lower oil prices present both
opportunities and challenges. In many oil-importing
countries, lower oil prices have eased the burden on
monetary policy and created some fiscal policy space.
Exporters of oil and other commodities with worsening terms of trade will need to adjust public spending
in the face of lower commodity-related revenue. These
countries should also continue to upgrade their fiscal
policy frameworks and provide a longer-term anchor
to guide policy decisions. Reforms of energy subsidies
and taxation remain an important priority for many
countries.
