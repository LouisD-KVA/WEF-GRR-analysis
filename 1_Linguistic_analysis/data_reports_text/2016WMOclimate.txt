Foreword
Every year, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) issues a Statement on the State
of the Global Climate based on data provided
by National Meteorological and Hydrological
Services (NMHSs) and other national and
international organizations. For more than
20 years, these reports have been published in
the six official languages of the United Nations
to inform governments, international agencies, other WMO partners and the general
public about the global climate and significant
weather and climate trends and events at the
global and regional levels.
This latest report confirms that 2016 was the
warmest year on record: a remarkable 1.1 °C
above the pre-industrial period, which is 0.06 °C
above the previous record set in 2015. This
increase in global temperature is consistent
with other changes in the climate system.
Globally averaged sea-surface temperatures
were also the warmest on record; global sea
levels continued to rise; and Arctic sea-ice extent
was well below average for most of the year.
The powerful 2015/2016 El Niño played an
important role in the year’s climate and confirmed
that, when natural variability interacts with
anthropogenic climate change, the impacts on
human societies and the natural environment
can be severe. The year was marked by severe
droughts that affected agricultural production
and left people exposed to food insecurity in
southern and eastern Africa and Central America.
Hurricane Matthew caused significant damage
in Haiti and the United States, while heavy rains
and floods affected eastern and southern Asia.
Coral bleaching and mortality were reported in
many tropical waters, with important impacts on
marine food chains, ecosystems and fisheries.
With carbon dioxide reaching a record annual
average concentration of 4 0 0 par ts per
million (ppm) in the atmosphere, the influence
of human activities on the climate system
has become more and more evident. This
influence is increasingly being demonstrated by
attribution studies for some of the most critical
weather and climate extremes, in particular
extremes related to heat. Because the societal
and economic impacts of climate change have
become so important, WMO has partnered with
other UN organizations to include information
in the Statement on how climate has affected
people, agriculture, health and other sectors.

The entry into force of the Paris Agreement
under the UN Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCCC) on 4 November 2016
represents a historic landmark. It is vital that
its implementation becomes a reality and that
the Agreement guides the global community
in addressing climate change by curbing
greenhouse gases, fostering climate resilience
and mainstreaming climate adaptation into
national development policies.
At the request of the Conference of the Parties
(COP) to the UNFCCC at its annual session, which
took place in Marrakesh in 2016, both the annual
WMO Statement on the State of the Global
Climate and the annual WMO Greenhouse Gas
Bulletin will from now on be submitted to COP
to inform its decisions on the implementation of
the Paris Agreement. In this way, the Statements
will complement the assessment repor ts
that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) produces every six to seven
years. In addition to providing information
about scientific progress, WMO is committed to
supporting its Members in building operational
climate services that enable climate resilience
and adaptation.
I would like to take this opportunity to express
my gratitude to the NMHSs of WMO Members,
international and regional data centres and
agencies, climate experts from around the world
for their contributions and United Nations sister
agencies for their valuable input on societal and
economic impacts. They have greatly assisted
WMO in ensuring that this annual Statement
achieves the highest scientific standards and
societal relevance.
WMO welcomes suggestions from its Members
on how to further improve the Statement on the
State of the Global Climate, including how it can
better support action on the Paris Agreement,
the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk
Reduction and the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals.

Preface
The present Statement is based on datasets and
information that were made available by WMO
Members and partners. Comparisons were
made with climatological averages and records
(historical background) whenever possible and
appropriate.
More than 80 NMHSs provided direct input
to the Statement following WMO’s call for
contributions, or made their data and climate
reports available for access on their websites.
When necessary, WMO communicated with
the relevant national source in order to verify the information before its inclusion in the
Statement.

WMO Statements on the Global Climate report
on the status of selected Essential Climate
Variables as defined by the Global Climate
Observing System. The Statement also uses
information on climate impacts provided by
United Nations agencies having a mandate in
various social and economic domains. Input
from other sources affiliated under United
Nations mandates are also used, based on published and online reports and material. Figures
concerning casualties and economic losses
are sourced, unless otherwise stated, from
the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology
of Disasters (CRED), Université catholique de
Louvain, Belgium.

Executive summary
Warming continued in 2016, setting a new
temperature record of approximately 1.1 °C
above the pre-industrial period, and 0.06 °C
above the previous highest value set in 2015.
Carbon dioxide (CO 2) reached new highs at
400.0 ± 0.1 ppm in the atmosphere at the end of
2015. Global sea-ice extent dropped more than
4 million km2 below average – an unprecedented
anomaly – in November. Global sea levels rose
strongly during the 2015/2016 El Niño, with the
early 2016 values making new records.
The powerful 2015/2016 El Niño event exerted
a strong influence on the climate and societies
against a background of long-term climate
change. Severe droughts affected agriculture
and yield production in many parts of the world,
particularly in southern and eastern Africa
and parts of Central America, where several
million people experienced food insecurity
and hundreds of thousands were displaced
internally, according to reports from the World
Food Programme (WFP), the United Nations
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) and the International Organization for
Migration (IOM).

with Haiti sustaining the heaviest casualties.
There were also major economic losses in the
United States and elsewhere in the region.
Flooding severely affected eastern and southern
Asia with hundreds of lives lost, hundreds of
thousands of people displaced and severe
economic damage. Wet conditions led to good
crop production in many parts of the Sahel,
with record yields reported in Mali, Niger and
Senegal.1
Detection and attribution studies have demonstrated that human influence on the climate
has been a main driver behind the unequivocal
warming of the global climate system observed
since the 1950s, according to the Fifth Assessment Report of IPCC. Human influence has
also led to significant regional temperature
increases at the continental and subcontinental
levels. Shifts of the temperature distribution to
warmer regimes are expected to bring about
increases in the frequency and intensity of
extremely warm events.

TEMPERATURE
GLOBAL
The year 2016 was the warmest on record in
all major global surface temperature datasets,
although, in some, the difference between
2016 and the second warmest year, 2015,
was within the margin of uncertainty. In the
three dataset mean 2 used by WMO, 2016
was 0.83 °C ± 0.1°C warmer than the average
for the 1961–1990 reference period (0.52 °C
above the 1981–2010 average), 0.06 °C above
the previous highest value set in 2015. This
is also about 1.1 °C above the pre-industrial
period. The ERA-Interim reanalysis dataset 3
was even warmer, with global mean temperatures 0.62 °C above the 1981–2010 average and
0.18 °C warmer than those of 2015. It was the

Global temperatures in this Statement are reported using the
mean of the latest versions of the three datasets: GISTEMP,
NOAAGlobalTemp and HadCRUT maintained, respectively, by
NOAA, the US National Air and Space Administration (NASA)

University of East Anglia Climatic Research Unit. The combined
dataset extends back to 1880.

warmest year on record for both land areas
and oceans and for both the northern and
southern hemispheres.
The five- and ten-year mean temperatures
also reached their highest values on record,
with 2012–2016 and 2007–2016 respectively
being 0.65 °C and 0.57 °C above the 1961–1990
average (0.34 °C and 0.26 °C respectively above
the 1981–2010 average). Each of the 16 years
since 2001 has been at least 0.4 °C above the
1961–1990 average, a mark which, prior to 2001,
had only been reached once, in 1998. Global
temperatures continue to be consistent with a
warming trend of 0.1 °C to 0.2 °C per decade.
Differences between datasets largely reflect
their areal coverage. With warmth in 2016 being
especially pronounced in data-sparse regions of
the Arctic, the difference between 2015 and 2016
values is greatest in those datasets which either
represent the full Arctic (ERA-Interim reanalysis
of the European Centre for Medium Range
Weather Forecasts) or extrapolate station data
over long distances (GISTEMP dataset produced
by the US National Air and Space Administration
(NASA) Goddard Institute for Space Studies) and
least in those datasets which take a relatively
conservative approach to extrapolation and
hence treat large areas of the Arctic as missing
data (HadCRUT dataset produced by the UK
Met Office Hadley Centre in collaboration with
the Climatic Research Unit of the University of

but from September onwards, temperatures
were lower than those for the corresponding
month in 2015.

Global temperatures in 2016 were substantially influenced by the strong El Niño event of
2015/2016, especially early in the year. Temperatures in years in which strong El Niño events
finish, such as 1973, 1983 and 1998, are typically
0.1 °C to 0.2 °C warmer than background levels
(as indicated by 10-year mean temperatures
centred on each of those years) and temperatures in 2016 were consistent with that pattern.

TEMPERATURES OVER LAND

Conditions were especially warm from October
2015 to April 2016, when the El Niño influence
on global climate was at its maximum. Global
temperatures were at least 0.85 °C above the
1961–1990 average in each of those months,
peaking at 1.13 °C above the 1961–1990 average
in February 2016. It was somewhat less warm
from May onwards as El Niño broke down, with
each of the months from May to December
being between 0.65 °C and 0.75 °C above
average, except for August (+0.82 °C). Each
month from January to August, except for June,
had the highest global temperatures on record,

Warmth extended almost worldwide in 2016.
Temperatures were above the 1961–1990 average over the vast majority of the world’s land
areas, the only significant exceptions being
northern and central Argentina, and parts
of south-western Australia. Most mid- and
higher-latitude areas of the northern hemisphere
were at least 1 °C above the 1961–1990 average
(the main exceptions were in Quebec (Canada)
and parts of the far eastern Russian Federation).
Mean annual temperatures at least 3 °C above
the 1961–1990 average occurred in various
high-latitude locations, particularly along the
Arctic coast of the Russian Federation and in
Alaska and far north-western Canada, and on
islands in the Barents and Norwegian Seas. In
the high Arctic, in Norway, Svalbard Airport’s
mean annual temperature of −0.1 °C was 6.5 °C
above the 1961–1990 average and 1.6 °C above
the previous record.
Beyond the Arctic, the warmth was more notable for its consistency across the globe than
for its extreme nature in individual locations.
Only a relatively small proportion of countries
which reported national temperature data had
their warmest year on record, including India,

THE OCEANS
The rate of energy increase in the climate
system – the Earth’s energy imbalance – is the
most fundamental metric that defines the rate
of global climate change. On timescales longer
than about a year, the vast majority (more than
90%) of the Earth’s energy imbalance goes into
heating the oceans. Thus, tracking ocean temperatures and associated changes in ocean heat
content (OHC) allow us to monitor variations in
the Earth’s energy imbalance over time. As the
oceans warm, they expand, resulting in both
global and regional sea-level rise. Increased
OHC accounts for about 40% of the observed
global sea-level increase over the past 60 years.
Globally averaged sea-surface temperatures in
2016 were the warmest on record. As for land
temperatures, the anomalies were strongest in

the early months but, unlike land temperatures,
sea-surface temperatures fell only slightly after
April, with values from May to October still
generally within 0.1 °C of the early peak before
a more substantial decline in November and
December.
Outside polar regions, areas which experienced
sea-surface temperatures at least 1 °C above
average included the western North Atlantic

average off Nova Scotia), the western North
Pacific from Japan south and west to China and

The most significant cool land area was in
South America, covering northern and central
Argentina, Paraguay and lowland Bolivia. Cool
temperature anomalies were most pronounced
in autumn and early winter, especially in May,
when Argentina had its lowest nationwide
mean maximum on record. (In marked contrast,
further south, it reached 17.2 °C at Esperanza
base in the Antarctic on 26 May, one of the
highest temperatures ever recorded there at
any time of year). The temperature did not
rise above 20 °C in Buenos Aires for 103 days
from 25 April to 5 August, the longest such
period on record. The other region with cool
annual anomalies, south-western Australia,
experienced its coldest winter since 1990.

On a wider scale, 2016 was in the five warmest
years for every inhabited continent. It was the
warmest year on record for North America,
with the continental United States having its
second warmest year, Alaska its warmest and
Canada its fourth warmest. It was the second
warmest for Africa and South America and
third warmest for Europe. Asia had its warmest
January–September on record, as did the Russian Federation, but relatively cool conditions
in the last three months of the year (including
Asia’s coolest November since 2000) saw Asia’s
annual mean temperature anomaly drop to
third highest, and the Russian Federation’s to
fifth. North America had its warmest autumn
on record and Africa its warmest June–August.

waters around Indonesia and northern Australia,
and the Tasman Sea. Record high mean annual
sea-surface temperatures occurred over most
of the Maritime Continent (covering waters of
Indonesia, northern Australia, the Philippines and
other islands in the region) and adjacent areas of
the western North Pacific, the Tasman Sea, the
Caribbean Sea and parts of the western North
Atlantic. Below-average sea-surface temperatures occurred in various parts of the Southern
Ocean south of 45°S, most notably around,
and east of, the Drake Passage between South
America and the Antarctic Peninsula, as well as
in the North Atlantic south of Greenland (where
the cool anomaly, however, was less pronounced
than in 2015), parts of the central North Pacific
and around south-western Australia.
The very warm ocean temperatures contributed
to significant coral bleaching in some tropical
waters. Among the areas significantly affected
was the Great Barrier Reef off the east coast
of Australia, where record high sea-surface
temperatures occurred in March. Coral mortality of up to 50% was reported in northern
parts of the reef north of Lizard Island. 5 Later
in the year, severe coral bleaching was also
repor ted in the Okinawa region of Japan,
with government surveys in November and

Coral bleaching was also reported from Pacific
island countries such as Fiji and Kiribati,
with associated fish deaths reported in Fiji.7
Significantly higher sea-surface temperatures,
as much as 3 °C above average in some areas,
are implicated in dramatic changes to the
physical, chemical and biological state of the
marine environment with great impacts on
food chains and marine ecosystems, as well as
socioeconomically important fisheries. 8
Global OHC 9 fell slightly from the record high
values of 2015, but mean annual values were
still the second highest on record. Northern
hemisphere OHC reached new record highs
in 2016 that were outweighed in the global
average by substantial falls in the southern
hemisphere. According to NOAA data, the total
global OHC anomaly in 2016 (from a 1955–2006
reference period) was 140 ZJ10 for the 0–700 m
layer, and 208 ZJ for the 0 –2 000 m layer,
compared with 151 ZJ and 224 ZJ respectively
in 2015.
Globally, sea level has risen by 20 cm since the
start of the twentieth century, due mostly to
thermal expansion of the oceans and melting
of glaciers and ice caps. Some regions are
experiencing greater sea-level rise than others.
The tropical western Pacific observed some of
the highest rising sea-level rates over the period
1993–2015, which was a significant factor in the
enormous devastation in parts of the Philippines
when Typhoon Haiyan caused a massive storm
surge in November 2013.

Global sea levels rose strongly during the
2015/2016 El Niño, rising about 15 mm between
November 2014 and February 2016, well above
the post-1993 trend of 3 mm–3.5 mm per year,
with the early 2016 values reaching new record
highs. From February to August, sea levels
remained fairly stable as the influence of El
Niño declined. Final 2016 sea-level data are not
yet available at the time of writing.11

GREENHOUSE GASES
The latest analysis of observations from the
WMO Global Atmosphere Watch Programme
shows that globally averaged surface mole
fractions for CO2, methane (CH4) and nitrous
oxide (N2O) reached new highs in 2015, with
CO2 at 400.0 ± 0.1 ppm, CH4 at 1 845 ± 2 parts
per billion (ppb) and N2O at 328.0 ± 0.1 ppb.
These values constitute, respectively, 144%,
256% and 121% of pre-industrial (before 1750)
levels. Comprehensive global greenhouse data
for 2016 will not be available until later in 2017.
The increase of CO2 from 2014 to 2015 was larger
than that observed from 2013 to 2014 and that
averaged over the past 10 years, despite no
significant change in emissions from fossil-fuel

sources.12 The El Niño event contributed to the
increased growth rate in 2015, both through
increased emissions from terrestrial sources
(e.g. forest fires) and decreased uptake of CO2
by vegetation in drought-affected areas. The
increase of CH4 from 2014 to 2015 was also larger
than that observed from 2013 to 2014 and that
averaged over the last decade. The increase
of N2O from 2014 to 2015 was similar to that
observed from 2013 to 2014 and greater than
the average growth rate over the past 10 years.
The NOAA Annual Greenhouse Gas Index shows
that, from 1990 to 2015, radiative forcing by
long-lived greenhouse gases increased by
37%, with CO 2 accounting for about 80% of
this increase.

THE CRYOSPHERE IN 2016
The cryosphere component of the Earth system includes solid precipitation, snow cover,
sea ice, lake and river ice, glaciers, ice caps,
ice sheets, permafrost and seasonally frozen
ground. The cryosphere provides some of the
most useful indicators of climate change, yet is
one of the most under-sampled domains of the
Earth system. There are at least 30 cryospheric
properties that, ideally, would be measured.
Many are measured at the surface, but spatial

slow summer melt resulted in the seasonal
minimum – 4.14 million km2 – being well above
the record low of 2012. In 2016, the annual
minimum was equal to the second lowest on
record in 2007. The 2016 autumn freeze-up was
exceptionally slow – with sea-ice extent even
contracting for a few days in mid-November.
The mean November extent of 9.08 million km2
was 0.8 million km2 below the previous record
low. Anomalies became slightly less extreme
in December.

Antarctic sea-ice extent was close to the
1979–2015 average for the first eight months
of 2016, reaching a seasonal maximum of
18.44 million km2 on 31 August. This was the earliest seasonal maximum on record. The spring
melt was then exceptionally rapid, resulting in
a November mean extent of 14.54 million km2
– by far the lowest on record (1.0 million km2
below the previous lowest) – and 5.7 standard
deviations below average: easily the largest
monthly anomaly in the satellite record. The
reasons for the rapid collapse of Antarctic
sea ice in late 2016 are not yet completely
understood, although local winds are likely to
have been a substantial contributor.

coverage is generally poor. Some have been
measured for many years from space; the
capability to measure others with satellites is
developing. The major cryosphere elements
for which assessment is provided for 2016
include sea ice, glaciers and ice sheets and
snow cover.

With Arctic and Antarctic sea-ice extent at
record low levels simultaneously, global seaice extent in November was also far below
average. After having been 1 million km2 to
2 million km2 below the 1979–2015 average
for most of the year, it dropped more than
4 million km2 below average in November –
an unprecedented anomaly – before a slight
recovery in December.

SEA ICE

GLACIERS AND ICE SHEETS

Arctic sea-ice extent13 was well below average
throughout 2016 and was at record low levels for
large parts of the year. The seasonal maximum
of 14.52 million km2 on 24 March was the lowest
seasonal maximum in the 1979–2016 satellite
record, just below that of 2015. Sea-ice extent
again dropped to record low levels for the
time of year in May and June but a relatively

Preliminary data from the World Glacier Monitoring Service indicate that mountain glaciers
continued to melt in 2016. Those reference
glaciers for which 2015/2016 data are available
show a mean mass balance of −858 mm, with
only one of 26 glaciers showing a positive mass
balance. This mean mass balance deficit is less
extreme than that of 2014/2015, but is slightly
above the 2003–2015 average.

Data in this section are sourced from the US National Snow
and Ice Data Center (sea ice), the World Glacier Monitoring
Service (mountain glaciers), the Danish Meteorological Institute
(Greenland ice sheet), Rutgers University (global snow cover),
Snowy Hydro (Australian snow cover) and relevant NMHSs.

The loss of Greenland ice sheets in the 12 months
to August 2016 was a similar rate to that of
recent means. The surface mass balance for
this period was close to the 1990–2013 average,
with above-average accumulation during the

13

10

colder months being offset by above-average
melting, especially in July. The melt season
also had an unusually early start as a result
of record high April temperatures at many
Greenland locations. The loss of glacier area
was the largest since 2012. Accumulation was
well above average in the last quarter of 2016,
especially in October, mostly as a result of
exceptionally heavy precipitation in south-east
Greenland.

SNOW COVER
Northern hemisphere mean annual snowcover extent for 2016 was 24.6 million km2,
0.5 million km2 below the 1967–2015 average
and the 12th lowest value on record. This was
very similar to 2015.
After above-average snow cover in January,
snow cover was well below average from February
to June, with cover between 2.4 million km2 and
3.3 million km2 below average. The April mean
snow-cover extent was the lowest on record, with
March ranking second, February and June third
and May fourth. Autumn snow cover, however,
was above average, as it had been in the previous
three years. There were positive anomalies from
September and each month from October to
December ranked in the 10 highest years on

record: October (4.7 million km2 above average)
ranked third highest, due, in part, to a record
high October snow-cover extent for Canada.
There are no comparable snow-cover records
for the southern hemisphere, where (except for
the Antarctic) snow is generally rare outside
high mountain regions. Abnormally dry and
warm conditions in southern South America
were reflected in a 69-day period, with no snow
falling at Ushuaia (Argentina) from 21 April
to 30 June: a record for that time of year.
In Australia, peak seasonal snow depths at
Spencers Creek in the Snowy Mountains were
slightly below average, but high precipitation
and below-average temperatures in September
and October led to a late finish to the season,
with an unusually late seasonal peak in the
first week of October.

MAJOR CLIMATE DRIVERS
There are several large-scale modes of variability in the world’s climate that influence
conditions over large parts of the world on
seasonal to interannual timescales. The El Niño–
Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is probably the
best-known of the major drivers of interannual
climate variability. The equatorial Indian Ocean
is also subject to fluctuations in sea-surface

temperatures, although on a less regular basis
than the Pacific. The Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)
describes a mode of variability that affects
the western and eastern parts of the ocean.
The Arctic Oscillation (AO) and North Atlantic
Oscillation (NAO) are two closely related modes
of variability in the atmospheric circulation at
middle and higher latitudes of the northern
hemisphere. In positive mode, the subtropical
high-pressure ridge is stronger than normal, as
are areas of low pressure at higher latitudes,
such as the “Icelandic” and “Aleutian” lows,
resulting in enhanced westerly circulation
through mid-latitudes. In negative mode, the
reverse is true, with a weakened subtropical
ridge, weakened higher-latitude, low-pressure
areas and anomalous easterly flow through
mid-latitudes. The Southern Annular Mode
(SAM), also known as the Antarctic Oscillation
(AAO), is the southern hemisphere analogue
of the AO.
The year began with a strong El Niño event
near peak levels in the tropical Pacific Ocean,
with sea-surface temperatures still more than
2 °C above average in the east-central equatorial
Pacific region in January. Conditions cooled
steadily through the early months of the year,
consistent with typical El Niño decay patterns,
and ocean temperatures had fallen below El
Niño thresholds by May. The 2015/2016 El Niño
event reached a peak Oceanic Niño Index (ONI)14

The Oceanic Niño Index is defined as the three-month running
mean of sea-surface temperature anomalies in the Niño 3.4

value of +2.3 °C for the three-month period
November 2015 to January 2016, making it
one of the three strongest events since 1950
together with those of 1997/1998 and 1982/1983.
Equatorial Pacific temperatures were below
average for most of the second half of 2016. The
lowest ONI values were −0.8 °C in September,
October and November, which was sufficient
for a marginal La Niña event to be declared
by some agencies but as neutral conditions
by others.
There was a strong negative phase of IOD
between June and October, with abnormally
warm sea-surface temperatures in the eastern
tropical Indian Ocean between Indonesia and
north-western Australia and relatively cool
conditions off the east coast of Africa. Indian
Ocean Dipole index values fell below −1 °C in
both July and September, making it one of
the strongest negative episodes since records
began. Negative IOD phases are associated
with above-average rainfall in many parts of
Australia and Indonesia and dry conditions in
equatorial East Africa.
The AO was near average during January–March
2016 (the time of year when it has its strongest
influence on northern hemisphere climate), with
negative values in January being followed by
slightly positive values in February and March.
The AO index was then positive in the early
stages of the 2016/2017 northern hemisphere
winter. The NAO index was positive throughout
January to March 2016 (although only weakly
so in January) and again in December, although
less so than in 2015.

The AAO (or SAM) was in a strongly positive
phase for much of 2016, with standardized
three-month index values reaching their highest
level on record early in the year. Three-month
AAO index values were positive continuously
for almost two years from November 2014
to October 2016, the longest such period on
record. There was, however, a shift to negative
values in the last three months of 2016, which
continued into early 2017. Negative (positive)
phases of the AAO are associated with enhanced
(suppressed) westerlies on the poleward side
of the subtropical ridge, typically between
35°S and 45°S. During the positive AAO period,
anomalous easterly flow was especially pronounced in the South American sector, while,
later in the year, anomalous westerlies were
most prominent in Australian and New Zealand
longitudes.

PRECIPITATION
Global precipitation in 2016 was strongly influenced by the transition from El Niño conditions
in the early part of the year to neutral or weak
La Niña conditions in the second half. This
resulted in strong seasonal contrasts but annual
totals relatively close to average in many parts
of the world.
Some regions experienced heavy rainfall in the
post-El Niño period, resulting in annual totals
which were well above average. Indonesia and
Australia, both of which were also strongly
influenced after May by a negative IOD, had
extensive areas with rainfall above the 90th
percentile (wettest 10% of all years), as did
parts of south-eastern China.
It was a wet year in many high-latitude parts
of the nor thern hemisphere. A large area
with precipitation above the 90th percentile
extended from Kazakhstan westwards across
the western Russian Federation into Finland,
northern Sweden and Norway. Large parts
of the north-central Russian Federation were
dry, however, with much of the region north
of 55°N between the Urals and Lake Baikal
having precipitation below the 10th percentile.
Persistent high pressure over the far south of
South America and the positive AAO which prevailed for much of the year strongly influenced
precipitation in southern South America. It was
an exceptionally dry year in much of Chile from

the Santiago region southwards and in the far
south of Argentina. In contrast, on the eastern
side of the Andes in Argentina, precipitation
was well above average over many areas from
northern Patagonia northwards.
The tropical west coast of South America, which
normally experiences very heavy rain during
strong El Niño years, only had patchy falls in
the early months of 2016, with seasonal rainfall
generally close to average in western Peru and
Ecuador. Another area to miss out on typical El
Niño rainfall was California, where 2015/2016
seasonal rainfall was near average (after four
very dry years in succession), making only
limited inroads into long-term drought, although
the situation was eased by above-average rainfall in late 2016, especially in the north.
Precipitation was close to average over most of
central and western Europe, with a very wet first
half of the year contrasting with a dry second
half. The 2015/2016 winter was very wet across
the western fringe of Europe, with Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland having their wettest
winter on record (and the United Kingdom as a
whole its second-wettest). May and June were
also very wet in many parts of west-central
Europe with significant flooding, particularly
in France and Germany. The July–September
period was dry in much of western and central
Europe, with France having its driest July and
August on record. December was also extremely
dry, with many areas having less than 20% of
normal precipitation. Lowland Switzerland had

contrast between the first and second half of the
year was that Uccle (Belgium) had its wettest

followed by its third-driest July–December (36%
below average).

EXTREME EVENTS
Extreme events are responsible for many significant impacts, in terms of both casualties and
economic effects. The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) has found15 that small developing
States are disproportionately affected by natural
disasters, with the average annual cost being
much greater than in larger countries.

precipitation during the course of 2016, although,
in some cases, the impacts of drought linger.
World Food Programme projections indicated
that the number of people requiring assistance
as a result of El-Niño-related droughts would
peak in February 2017.
Much of southern Africa began the year in severe
drought. For the second year in succession,
rainfall was widely 20%–60% below average
for the summer rainy season (October–April)
in 2015/2016. There were crop failures in many
parts of the region. Drought emergencies were
declared in all but one of South Africa’s provinces, while, further north, poor agricultural
production resulted in food shortages: WFP
estimated that 18.2 million people would require
emergency assistance by early 2017. Total cereal
production in southern Africa in 2015/2016 was
down by 13% from 2014/2015 and by 31% from
2013/2014. The 2016/2017 rainy season had a
promising start, with October–December rainfall
generally near or above average over most
of the region. Some dry pockets (e.g. central
and northern Malawi) remain, and significant
improvements in the humanitarian situation
are not expected until harvests in March and
April 2017.
Significant drought affected the Amazon basin
in Brazil, as well as the country’s north-east:
both regions have a historical tendency towards
drought in the later stages of El Niño events.
After very dry conditions throughout the drier
months in mid-2015, rainfall deficits in the
Amazon extended to the peak rainfall months
of January–March, especially across western
and southern parts of the basin, and rainfall
continued at near- to below-average levels
over the following months. By the end of July,
24-month rainfall was in the extremely dry category (Standardized Precipitation Index below −2)
over almost the entire Amazon basin. Rainfall in
the later part of the year was patchy and resulted
only in modest and localized improvements in
the situation. Provisional figures show 2016 as
the driest calendar year on record averaged
over the Amazon basin. Crop production was
reduced and rivers were at abnormally low
levels: the Acre struck record lows. Drought
continued in north-east Brazil, where heavy
rain in January was not followed up with further
rainfall and more than 60% of the region was
classified as being in exceptional drought by
the end of the year. Cereal production in Brazil

was 22% below the five-year average. Drought
conditions elsewhere in northern South America
(particularly Colombia and Venezuela) eased
from April onwards, although low water-storage
levels contributed to electricity shortages in
Venezuela in the first half of the year. Central
America also experienced ongoing drought in
early 2016, with FAO estimating that 3.5 million
people were experiencing food insecurity in El
Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua.
Substantial improvement did not occur in these
areas until later in the year.
The most dramatic transition from drought to
above-average rainfall occurred in Australia.
Droughts were well established early in the year
in two separate regions – inland Queensland
and a region of the south-east encompassing
Tasmania, western Victoria and south-east
South Australia – with below-average rainfall
extending back to 2012 in parts of both regions.
Tasmania was especially badly affected with
significant fires and electricity shortages from
low levels in hydroelectric storages (exacerbated
by the failure of connections to the mainland).
There was a marked shift to above-average
rainfall from May onwards as El Niño weakened
and a negative IOD phase became established,
culminating in September, when many parts
of eastern Australia had record high monthly
rainfall. The subsequent extensive flooding of
inland rivers caused the main highway from
Melbourne to Brisbane to be closed for more
than a month. Damaging flooding occurred in
early June on the east coast and in northern
Tasmania. After the driest eight months on
record from September 2015 to April 2016,
Tasmania had its wettest May to December
on record. The high rainfall and mild spring
conditions led to record grain production with
winter crop production expected to be 49%
above that of 2015.16
Other regions where the year started with
significant droughts in place (largely reflecting poor rainy seasons in mid-2015) included
much of India, parts of Viet Nam (especially the
Mekong Delta), northern Ethiopia and large parts
of Indonesia. There were significant agricultural
losses in Viet Nam, where 83% of the national

onwards, centred on Java and Sumatra, in
what is normally the drier season. (This was
even more apparent on Christmas Island, south
of Java, where April–November rainfall was
3 900 mm – nearly four times the average). In
the South Pacific, abnormally dry conditions in
late 2015 and the early months of 2016 affected

Dry conditions affected parts of East Africa
with the situation worsening towards the end
of the year. Rainfall in Somalia, Kenya and the
United Republic of Tanzania was generally near
to below average during the “long rains” season
(March to May), before a particularly poor “short
rains” season (October to December). Although
there were some useful falls towards the end of
the season, October–December rainfall was still
widely 50% or more below average, particularly
in eastern United Republic of Tanzania, eastern
Kenya, and Somalia, reaching 70% to 90% below
average in the coastal strip of Kenya and the
United Republic of Tanzania. This region has
a history of major humanitarian impacts from
drought and agencies are monitoring the situation closely at the time of writing, with UNHCR
reporting that 135 000 people were internally
displaced within Somalia as of February 2017.
Substantial crop losses and livestock distress
from poor pasture conditions were also reported
in Kenya. The 2015/2016 winter season was
also dry in Morocco and north-west Algeria,
where rainfall for the period September 2015
to April 2016 was 15%–40% below average at
most Moroccan locations. The wheat harvest
in Morocco was 65% below that of 2015.
Very dry conditions affected most of southern
and central Chile, as well as the far south of
Argentina. Rainfall was generally 30%–60%
below average in most of this region. In Chile,
it was the driest year on record for Coyhaique
and Balmaceda and the second driest for Puerto
Montt, Osorno and Punta Arenas. This continues
a prolonged period of below-average rainfall in
central Chile, with Santiago’s mean rainfall for
the six years 2011–2016 being 40% below the
long-term average. The dry conditions contributed to major forest fires which broke out late
in the year before worsening in January 2017.
There was also extreme heat in late 2016, with
a new record of 37.3 °C being set in Santiago
on 14 December.19 Drought conditions also
prevailed in parts of Bolivia.

Many parts of the eastern United States and
adjacent parts of eastern Canada had a dry

the United States was especially dry in October
and November, where some locations had little
or no rainfall for two months, contributing to
major wildfires. After good monsoon rains
over most of India in mid-2016, conditions
became very dry in those parts of southern
India which receive their peak rainfall during
the north-east monsoon between October and
December. It was the driest October–December
on record over this region with seasonal rainfall
65% below average (in marked contrast to the
severe flooding which affected the region in
late 2015). The dry conditions also affected
Sri Lanka.

SIGNIFICANT FLOODS
The Yangtze basin in China experienced its
most significant flood season since 1999, with
some tributaries experiencing record flood
levels. Rainfall was consistently high across
the middle and lower Yangtze region from April
to July, with total April–July rainfall over the
region about 30% above average and similar
to, or slightly above, that of 1998 and 1999.
Over shorter timescales, very heavy rains from
18 to 20 July centred on the Beijing region also
caused destructive flooding. In total, 310 deaths
and damage amounting to US$ 14 billion20 were
attributed to flooding in the Yangtze and Beijing
regions. Averaged over China as a whole, it
was the wettest year on record, with national
mean rainfall of 730 mm being 16% above the
long-term average.
Flooding and landslides in Sri Lanka in mid-May
left more than 200 people dead or missing21,
and several hundreds of thousands displaced.
Significant flooding was reported in various
parts of India during the monsoon season,
particularly in the Ganges basin, where the
Ganges River reached record heights at some
locations, as well as in Nepal and Bangladesh.

Rainfall (mm)

Consistently above-average rainfall in May and
early June fell in parts of western Europe. In
northern France, it reached as much as double
the monthly average, culminating in four-day
totals from 28 to 31 May of 80 mm–120 mm in
the Paris region. This led to major flooding in
the region at the beginning of June. In Paris,
the Seine River reached its fifth highest level
on record (and the highest outside the winter
months), leading to major property damage.

Extreme flooding affected parts of the southern United States, especially Louisiana, from
9 to 15 August. Seven-day rainfall totals in the
worst-affected areas ranged from 500 mm to
800 mm, with 432 mm recorded in 15 hours in
Livingston on 12 August. Some rivers peaked
at levels up to 1.5 m above previous records.
Thirteen deaths were reported and more than
50 000 homes and 20 000 businesses were damaged or destroyed. Total losses were estimated
at US$ 10 billion. 22
Generally above-average seasonal rainfall in
the Sahel led to significant flooding in the Niger
basin. In the upper Niger, the river reached
its highest level since 1964 at Mopti (Mali) on
6 September and flooding in the inner Niger Delta
in Mali in November and December attained

Flooding also occurred further downstream,
particularly in Niger and northern Nigeria,
and was reported in other parts of West Africa
outside the Niger basin, including Gambia,
Senegal and Ghana. Significant flooding was
also reported in the southern half of Sudan.
The wet conditions led to good crop production
in many parts of the Sahel, with record yields
reported in Mali, Niger and Senegal.

TROPICAL CYCLONES
Global tropical cyclone activity was close to
normal, with a total of 82 cyclones, slightly
below the long-term average of 85. Activity was
above average in the North Atlantic (15 cyclones,
average 12) and East Pacific (21 cyclones,
average 16) regions, but below average in the
southern hemisphere, particularly the Australian
region, which had its least active season since
satellite records began with only three cyclones
(average 10). After the second latest start on
record, with the first named storm (Nepartak)
not forming until 3 July, the North-West Pacific
season was close to average with 26 cyclones,
although their geographic distribution had some
unusual features, such as three landfalls on
the Japanese island of Hokkaido: the first time
this has occurred since records began in 1951.
The most destructive tropical cyclone of the year
(and also the most damaging meteorological
disaster of any type) was Hurricane Matthew,
which affected various parts of the North Atlantic
in late September and early October. It reached
Category 5 intensity south of Haiti – the first
Atlantic hurricane to do so since 2007 – and
crossed south-western Haiti as a Category 4
system on 4 October. After crossing eastern
Cuba and the Bahamas, Matthew then moved

18

north just off the eastern coast of the United
States with a near-parallel track to the coast
and briefly making landfall in South Carolina
before moving back offshore. The heaviest
casualties associated with Matthew occurred
in Haiti, with at least 546 deaths23 reported. It
also contributed to worsening existing issues of
food insecurity and disease in the country, with
cholera cases in the worst-affected provinces
increasing by 50% from pre-hurricane levels. 24
There were also major economic losses in the
United States (mostly from flooding in North
and South Carolina, Georgia and Florida), Cuba,
the Bahamas and Haiti, amounting to more than
US$ 15 billion.
Another event responsible for a major disaster
was Typhoon Lionrock in late August. The major
effect of Lionrock was in north-eastern areas
of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea
(DPRK), where rainfall of up to 320 mm in four
days led to catastrophic flooding. According to
government reports, which described the event
as the most significant natural disaster since
the foundation of DPRK, there were 133 deaths,
395 people missing and 11 600 dwellings
destroyed. 25
Cyclone Winston crossed the islands of Fiji in
late February as a Category 5 system, making
it the strongest cyclone on record for Fiji. It was
associated with major damage, especially on
the north shore of the main island of Viti Levu.
A total of 44 deaths were reported and damage
was estimated at US$ 1.4 billion. Winston also
led to significant damage in Tonga.
Other significant intense tropical cyclones
included: Typhoon Nepartak, which was associated with 86 deaths in the Taiwan province
of China and featured an observed pressure of
911 hPa; Typhoon Meranti, which was reported
to be the most intense landfall on record in
Fujian province, China, after first crossing the
far northern islands of the Philippines, and had

Fantala, which generated 10-minute average
winds of 250 km/h on 17 April south of the
Seychelles, making it one of the most intense
cyclones ever recorded in the South-West Indian
Ocean.
There were two unusual January hurricanes
in the northern hemisphere: Pali, in the central
Pacific, in addition to its unusual timing, also
reached the lowest latitude (2°N) of any western
hemisphere hurricane, while Alex was the first
January hurricane in the North Atlantic since
1938. It caused some damage in the Azores.
In late November, Otto set several records for
late-season formation and intensity, and also
had the southernmost recorded landfall of
any tropical cyclone in Central America when
it crossed the coast of southern Nicaragua. It
was also the first tropical cyclone to cross Costa
Rica and one of the few to retain its identity as
a tropical cyclone across Central America and
to re-emerge on the Pacific Ocean side.

DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRES IN
SEVERAL PARTS OF THE WORLD
The most damaging wildfire in Canadian history – and the country’s most costly natural
disaster – occurred in May. After an unusually
dry and mild start to the year, with the driest
winter and spring on record, fire broke out near

Fort McMurray in Alberta early in the month,
before moving through the city on 4 May as
temperatures reached 33 °C – the highest on
record so early in the year – accompanied by
strong winds and low humidity. The fire led to
the total evacuation of the city and ultimately
destroyed 2 400 buildings, with US$ 3 billion in
insured losses and several billion more in other
losses26. No deaths were directly attributed to
the fire, although two people died in a road accident during the evacuation. The fire ultimately
burned an area of about 590 000 ha before being
declared under control in early July.
Later in the year, unusually dry conditions in
the south-eastern United States contributed
to the most destructive wildfire in modern
history. In and around Gatlinburg, Tennessee,
on 28 November, 14 deaths were reported
and some 2 400 buildings were damaged or
destroyed. 27
During the summer of 2015/2016, long-lived
fires affected large parts of central and western Tasmania, which, at the time, was badly
affected by drought. The fires mostly broke out
in mid-January and extended to areas on the

EXTREME HEAT AND COLD

Mohamed Azakir (Reuters)

There were a number of major heatwaves.
The year started with an extreme heatwave in
southern Africa, exacerbated by the ongoing
drought. Many stations set all-time records in
the first week of January; in some cases, these
broke records which were only a few weeks’
old, following other heatwaves in November
and December 2015. On 7 January, temperatures reached 42.7 °C at Pretoria and 38.9 °C
at Johannesburg, both of which were 3 °C or
more above the all-time records at those sites
prior to November 2015.

Extreme heat affected South and South-East
Asia in April and May, prior to the start of the
summer monsoon; South-East Asia was badly
affected in April. The extreme heat was centred
on Thailand, where a national record of 44.6 °C
was set at Mae Hong Son on 28 April and all-time
records were set at many individual locations.
A number of monthly records were set in March
and April in Malaysia. A few weeks later, 51.0 °C
was observed on 19 May at Phalodi, the highest
temperature on record for India.
Record or near-record temperatures occurred
in parts of the Middle East and northern Africa
on a number of occasions from late July to
early September. The highest temperature
observed was 54.0 °C at Mitribah (Kuwait) on
21 July which (subject to ratification) will be the
highest temperature on record for Asia. Other
extremely high temperatures included 53.9 °C
at Basra (Iraq) and 53.0 °C at Delhoran (Islamic
Republic of Iran – a national record), both on
22 July, while significant high temperatures
were also reported in Morocco, Tunisia, Libya
and the United Arab Emirates.
A significant late-season heatwave affected
many parts of western and central Europe
in the first half of September. The highest
temperatures occurred in southern Spain,
where 45.4 °C was recorded at Cordoba on
6 September; September records were set at
many other stations in Spain and in Portugal.
The heat extended to north-western Africa
with some record high September temperatures reported in Morocco. The heat extended
to northern Europe: 34.4 °C at Gravesend
(England) on 13 September was a late-season
record for the United Kingdom by more than
2 °C and the highest September temperature
in the United Kingdom since 1911, while many
monthly or late-season records were set in
Germany, Sweden and Norway.
The most significant cold wave occurred in
late January in eastern Asia, with extreme low
temperatures extending southwards from eastern China as far south as Thailand. In southern
China, Guangzhou recorded its first snow since
1967 and Nanning its first since 1983, whilst
the temperature fell to 3.1 °C at the Hong Kong
Observatory, its sixth lowest temperature on
record. Late-season frosts led to significant
agricultural damage in late April in parts of
central and eastern Europe, with losses of

SEVERE STORMS, SNOWFALLS AND
TORNADOES
Severe thunderstorms and tornadoes triggered
significant losses in many parts of the world.
The worst single incident occurred in Yancheng,
Jiangsu province, China, on 23 June, when
a tornado was associated with 99 deaths. It
was one of the most destructive tornadoes in
recorded Chinese history, at a time when the
region was also experiencing severe flooding.
Tornado activity in the United States was below
the long-term average for the fifth consecutive
year, with a preliminary count of 985 tornadoes,
about 10% below the post-1990 average. A total
of 17 tornado-related fatalities for the year was
also well below average. There were, however,
many other severe, destructive thunderstorms.
Two separate outbreaks of major hailstorms in
Texas, one around Dallas–Fort Worth in March
and a second centred on San Antonio in April,
resulted in combined damage of more than

however, these compounds will remain in the
atmosphere for many decades. There is still more

Baltimore (74 cm). The storm was rated by NOAA
as the fourth most-impactful snowstorm in the
region since 1950.
Unusually early heavy snowfalls affected parts
of Scandinavia in early November as cold easterly winds passed over relatively warm coastal
waters. A snow depth of 39 cm, after two days of
heavy snow, at Stockholm on 10 November was
a record for November. Heavy falls also occurred
in other parts of eastern Sweden (including
the island of Götland), as well as on the west
side of the Oslofjord in Norway. Significant
early snowfalls also affected Japan, with Tokyo
receiving its first measurable November snow
since records began in 1875.

STRATOSPHERIC OZONE
Following the success of the Montreal Protocol,
the use of halons and chlorofluorocarbons has
been discontinued and the size of the Antarctic

Ozone depletion started relatively early due to
vortex excursion into sunlit regions. The ozone
hole area reached its maximum for 2016 on
28 September with 23.1 million km2, whereas it
reached 28.2 million km2 on 2 October in 2015,
according to an analysis by the US National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (see
Figure 14). A second analysis by the Royal
Netherlands Meteorological Institute found that
the 2016 ozone hole area reached a maximum
of 22.3 million km2 on 28 September, whereas
the 2015 ozone hole area reached a maximum
of 27.1 million km2 on 9 October. In both cases,
peak values were close to the average of the last
10 years, and somewhat lower than the record
or near-record high values observed in 2015.
In the Arctic, the degree of stratospheric column
ozone loss averaged over the polar vortex
reached 27% in early March 2016. This is more
than the average for the 1994 –2016 period
(18%), but less than the most severe ozone loss
observed in the Arctic (38% in 2011, 30% in 1996).
The 2015/2016 winter started out unusually cold,
but a sudden stratospheric warming in early
February averted further ozone loss.

While the climate system recognizes no
national boundaries, people, governments and businesses do. Monitoring
and understanding the climate system
at the local and national scales are vital
for countries to develop resilience in the
face of a changing climate.
Today, many countries operationally monitor
and report their nation’s weather and climate on
a routine basis. Indeed, the WMO Statements
on the State of the Global Climate are underpinned by a wide range of climate-monitoring
products produced by WMO Members. These
products concisely summarize recent climate
conditions that are experienced around the
world, including variations in rainfall and
temperature at monthly, seasonal, annual
and multi-year timescales.
Well-developed observational infrastructure,
data-management practices and climate analysis form essential capabilities for NMHSs to
operate robust climate monitoring. WMO continues to work with the NMHSs to develop and
use standards and applications for consistent
monitoring of the climate system around the
world and for the provision of high-quality and
timely services to various sectors.
The development of standard National Climate Monitoring Products (NCMPs), based on
a standard set of climate indices that allows a
like-for-like comparison across regions, assists
in the development of a truly global picture

of climate variability, providing an improved
understanding of climate change and its impact
on people, societies and the environment.
It also facilitates the greater contribution of
WMO Members to global climate syntheses
and reports, such as the WMO Statement on
the State of the Global Climate and the State
of the Climate annual reports of the Bulletin of
the American Meteorological Society.
To this end, WMO has recently developed
a short list of standard NCMPs. Computer
software has also been developed to help build
the capacity for the operational and timely
production of NCMPs to summarize recent
temperature and precipitation conditions at
a national scale and show how they compare
with the past.
For example, the annual average temperature
for Canada was 0.51°C above the 1981–2010
average, making 2015 the 11th warmest year in
a series that began in 1950. The precipitation
anomaly was +0.09% above the long-term
average making 2015 the 22nd wettest year on
record (see Figure 15). By displaying the data
in this way, it is easy to see how year-to-year
variations compare with long-term trends.
National Climate Monitoring Products are
designed to be produced on a regular basis by
most countries, including those with relatively
fewer resources dedicated to climate-monitoring
activities. The products of the initial suite were
chosen because they have an immediate practical and scientific benefit. They are as follows:
1. Mean temperature anomaly: the nationally
averaged temperature departure from the
long-term average (1981–2010) for the
month and year;
2. Precipitation anomaly: total precipitation
for the month and year, expressed as a
percentage of the long-term average, across
the country;
3. Standardized Precipitation Index: a measure of the nationally averaged standardized
precipitation anomaly;
4. Warm days: number of days in the month
when daily maximum temperature exceeded
the 90th percentile, averaged across the
country;

23

5. Cold nights: number of days in the month
when daily minimum temperature was
below the 10th percentile, averaged across
the country; and
6. Temperature and precipitation station
records: number of stations that reported
record daily maximum temperature, minimum temperature and precipitation.
The first two NCMPs are widely used to describe
overall temperature and rainfall deviations.
The Standardized Precipitation Index is used in
drought monitoring. The fourth and fifth – warm
days and cold nights – represent moderate
extremes of temperature. The sixth NCMP
indicates when short-lived, but potentially
high-impact, events have occurred.
Stakeholders, from the citizens who are directly
affected by the impacts of a changing climate,
to governmental and industrial sectors, such as
agriculture, energy and human health, can use

this information to help make well-informed decisions. National Climate Monitoring Products can
further provide benefits within a country by raising
awareness and understanding of the effects of
climate variability and change. Monitoring can
also provide a means to identify longer-term
problems, such as droughts, as they develop.
Moreover, NCMPs are valuable for understanding
seasonal forecasts, giving the starting point from
which the ensuing season will unfold.
A network of focal points – local experts who
will produce and disseminate the NCMPs – is
being developed and capacity-development
workshops to train focal points to produce the
NCMPs are being planned.

REFERENCE PERIODS
It is common practice to compare recent climate data with averages from a long-term
reference period. Seventeenth World Meteorological Congress in 2015 adopted 1981–2010
as a standard reference period for routine climate-monitoring purposes, whilst retaining
1961–1990 as the baseline for long-term analyses of climate change.
In this Statement, both 1961–1990 and 1981–2010 reference periods are used where appropriate if data are available. Many datasets, especially those which use satellite data, do
not have data for the full 1961–1990 period and hence only a 1981–2010 reference period
is available for use.
No set definition exists for the “pre-industrial” period. A number of periods have been
proposed with respect to temperature observations, such as 1850–1900 and 1880–1900.
The available data indicate that these periods all give outcomes within 0.1 °C of each other.
The years 1880–1900 are used in this Statement as a reference period for pre-industrial
temperatures, to match the availability of data from global datasets, which start in 1880.
In the case of greenhouse gases, for which ice cores provide reliable data well before the
start of the instrumental period, 1750 is used as the end of the pre-industrial period.
The choice of reference period has no effect on the ranking of individual years or on the
size of trends, as choosing a different reference period will increase or decrease all values
by a constant amount.
