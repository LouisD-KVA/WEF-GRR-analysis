Assumptions and Conventions

A number of assumptions have been adopted for the projections presented in the World Economic
Outlook. It has been assumed that real effective exchange rates will remain constant at their average
levels during August 18–September 15, 2008, except for the currencies participating in the European
exchange rate mechanism II (ERM II), which are assumed to remain constant in nominal terms
relative to the euro; that established policies of national authorities will be maintained (for specific
assumptions about fiscal and monetary policies in industrial countries, see Box A1); that the average
price of oil will be $107.25 a barrel in 2008 and $100.50 a barrel in 2009, and remain unchanged in
real terms over the medium term; that the six-month London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) on U.S.
dollar deposits will average 3.2 percent in 2008 and 3.1 percent in 2009; that the three-month euro
deposits rate will average 4.8 percent in 2008 and 4.2 percent in 2009; and that the six-month Japanese
yen deposit rate will yield an average of 1.0 percent in 2008 and 1.2 percent in 2009. These are, of
course, working hypotheses rather than forecasts, and the uncertainties surrounding them add to the
margin of error that would in any event be involved in the projections. The estimates and projections
are based on statistical information available through early October 2008.
The following conventions have been used throughout the World Economic Outlook:
...

to indicate that data are not available or not applicable;

—

to indicate that the figure is zero or negligible;

–	between years or months (for example, 2006–07 or January–June) to indicate the years or
months covered, including the beginning and ending years or months;
/

between years or months (for example, 2006/07) to indicate a fiscal or financial year.

“Billion” means a thousand million; “trillion” means a thousand billion.
“Basis points” refer to hundredths of 1 percentage point (for example, 25 basis points are equivalent
to ¼ of 1 percent point).
In figures and tables, shaded areas indicate IMF staff projections.
Minor discrepancies between sums of constituent figures and totals shown are due to rounding.
As used in this report, the term “country” does not in all cases refer to a territorial entity that is a
state as understood by international law and practice. As used here, the term also covers some territorial entities that are not states but for which statistical data are maintained on a separate and independent basis.

Preface

The analysis and projections contained in the World Economic Outlook are integral elements of the
IMF’s surveillance of economic developments and policies in its member countries, of developments
in international financial markets, and of the global economic system. The survey of prospects and
policies is the product of a comprehensive interdepartmental review of world economic developments,
which draws primarily on information the IMF staff gathers through its consultations with member
countries. These consultations are carried out in particular by the IMF’s area departments together
with the Strategy, Policy, and Review Department (formerly Policy Development and Review Department), the Monetary and Capital Markets Department, and the Fiscal Affairs Department.
The analysis in this report has been coordinated in the Research Department under the general
direction of Olivier Blanchard, Economic Counsellor and Director of Research. The project has been
directed by Charles Collyns, Deputy Director of the Research Department, and Jörg Decressin, Division
Chief, Research Department. The analysis has benefited from input during the early stages by Simon
Johnson, the former Economic Counsellor and Director of Research.
The primary contributors to this report are Roberto Cardarelli, Kevin Cheng, Stephan Danninger,
Mark De Broeck, Selim Elekdag, Thomas Helbling, Anna Ivanova, Florence Jaumotte, Daehaeng Kim,

External consultants include Joshua Aizenman, Antonio Fatás, Christopher Meissner, and Hyun Song
Shin. Linda Griffin Kean of the External Relations Department edited the manuscript and coordinated
the production of the publication. Lucy Scott Morales provided editorial assistance.
The analysis has benefited from comments and suggestions by staff from other IMF departments, as
well as by Executive Directors following their discussions of the report on September 17 and 19, 2008.
However, both projections and policy considerations are those of the IMF staff and should not be
attributed to Executive Directors or to their national authorities.

Foreword
Foreword

Having just joined the IMF, I can take very
little credit for this edition of the World Economic
Outlook. I regret it: Like its predecessors, this is
a remarkable document which gives the reader
a clear sense of what is happening in the world
economy. I thank Simon Johnson, Charles Collyns, Jörg Decressin, and their team for their
work.
Chapters 1 and 2 assess the state and the
evolution of the world economy, an exercise that
has rarely been so difficult. The world economy
is decelerating quickly—buffeted by an extraordinary financial shock and by still-high energy
and commodity prices—and many advanced
economies are close to or moving into recession.
Developments in financial markets have dominated the news in recent weeks. The subprime
crisis that unfolded in 2007 has now morphed
into a credit crisis that has caused major disruption to financial institutions in the United States
and Europe. Intensifying solvency concerns
about a number of the largest U.S.-based and
European financial institutions have pushed the
global financial system to the brink of systemic
meltdown. The effects on the real economy have
been limited so far. In part, this may be because
tax rebates in the United States supported consumption, while strong nonfinancial corporate
balance sheets and profitability have allowed
firms to use their own funds rather than borrow.
But neither of these factors can be expected
to last for very long. Credit conditions have
become significantly tighter in recent weeks,
threatening the ability of nonfinancial firms
and a number of emerging economies to raise
capital. The U.S. and European authorities have
taken extraordinary measures, including massive liquidity provision, intervention to restore
weak institutions, extension of guarantees, and
recent U.S. legislation to use public funds to buy
troubled assets from banks. But it is not yet clear
that these measures will be sufficient to stabilize

xii

markets and bolster confidence, and the situation remains highly uncertain.
This is not the only shock buffeting the world
economy. Prices of oil and basic commodities
have reached historically high levels in recent
months. In advanced economies, a combination of real wage flexibility, well-anchored
inflation expectations, and prospects of sharply
reduced activity have helped to limit rises in
core inflation. But in emerging and developing
economies, the impact has been much more
damaging. Real wages have fallen substantially.
Oil exporters have found it difficult to dampen
overheating economies.
Looking to the future, it is necessary to assess
how these shocks will likely work their way
through the world economy. Our forecasts are
based on three major assumptions. The first
is that commodity and oil prices are likely to
stabilize, relieving pressure on inflation and
giving more room, if needed, for expansionary
policies. The second is that U.S. housing prices
and activity will hit bottom within the next year,
leading to a recovery of residential investment.
The third is that, although credit will remain
tight, the elements of a systemic solution to the
financial crisis are now being put in place and
will prevent a further worsening of financial
intermediation. It is this combination that leads
us to forecast that world growth will begin to
recover at the end of 2009, albeit at a very slow
pace. There is, however, more than the usual
amount of uncertainty, and the downside risks
are far from negligible.
As usual, this World Economic Outlook also
tackles a number of topically important issues
in greater depth. Chapter 3 examines the threat
that the recent boom in commodity prices could
unwind the past two decades’ progress against
inflation. To be sure, the fall in some prices—
notably for oil—since mid-July has eased some
of the pressure, but it is too early to relax. Com-

Foreword

modity prices are likely to remain much higher
in real terms than in recent decades, and this
shift in relative prices will need to be absorbed
without triggering second-round effects on price
and wage formation. This task is likely to be
easier in the advanced economies, where widening output gaps are helping to restrain inflation
pressures. Moreover, these economies are much
less commodity-intensive than they were in the
1970s and have more flexible labor markets
and well-established monetary policy frameworks that have largely succeeded in anchoring
inflation expectations. However, emerging and
developing economies are more vulnerable to
inflation spillovers—because of their greater
resource intensity, less-well-established policy
frameworks, and more rapid rates of growth. In
many of these economies, second-round effects
are already increasingly visible, and although
slowing global growth and softening commodity
prices should help rein inflation back in, risks
remain that continued inflationary excesses will
degrade hard-earned inflation-fighting credentials, requiring even tougher action in the future
to put the cork back in the bottle.
Chapter 4 addresses what is clearly a central
concern for the global economy: What will be
the impact of the current financial crisis on
economic activity? It is now all too clear that we
are seeing the deepest shock to the global financial system since the Great Depression, at least
for the United States. Are we then doomed to
a slump in output as occurred in the 1930s? As
Chapter 4 shows, the historical record is mixed.
Periods of financial stress have not always been
followed by recessions or even by economic
slowdowns. However, the analysis also shows that
when the financial stress does major damage to
the banking system—as in the current episode—the likelihood increases of a severe and
protracted downturn in activity. This is clearly
demonstrated by the experiences of many economies that have struggled with virulent financial
crises over the past decades, for example, the
Nordic countries and Japan. Moreover, economies with more-arm’s length or market-based
financial systems seem to be particularly vul-

nerable to sharp contractions in activity in the
face of financial stress. This is because leverage
tends to be more procyclical in these economies—the risks of a credit crunch are greater.
Does this mean that the United States—with a
market-based financial system par excellence—is
heading for a deep recession? Not necessarily,
because, as the chapter shows, other factors
also matter. Two sources of support for the U.S.
economy are the quick and strong reaction of
the Federal Reserve to lower policy rates and the
robust state of the U.S. nonfinancial corporate
sector. Low indebtedness and high profits have
helped U.S. businesses ride the financial storm.
However, the longer the financial crisis continues, the less likely it is that nonfinancial firms
will be able to support strong growth.
Chapter 5 takes a fresh look at an old
debate—about the value of fiscal policy as a
countercyclical tool—which has taken on new
relevance as the global economy slows and
as turbulence in financial markets has raised
questions about the effectiveness of monetary
policy. The findings are not very encouraging
for proponents of fiscal activism: fiscal multipliers—the impact of discretionary fiscal stimulus
on output—are generally found to be quite low,
and sometimes even to operate in the wrong
direction, especially in economies with high
debt levels where a turn to expansionary fiscal
policy may raise doubts about long-term debt
sustainability. This does not necessarily mean
that policymakers should abandon fiscal policy
as a countercyclical tool, but it does underline
that fiscal initiatives, when needed, must be well
targeted to have the maximum short-run impact
without undermining long-run fiscal rectitude.
It is also worthwhile to consider whether
the role of fiscal policy as a macroeconomic
stabilizer could be enhanced by strengthening
the broader fiscal framework. Two options are
worth considering. First, there is the possibility
that automatic stabilizers could be boosted by
making regular tax and transfer programs more
cyclically responsive. For example, the generosity of unemployment insurance systems could be
automatically increased when the economy is in

xiii

Foreword

a downturn and jobs are harder to find. Second,
steps could be taken to strengthen the overall
governance structure for fiscal policy—thereby
reducing the risk of “debt bias” by ensuring that
fiscal easing during a downturn is balanced by
tightening during expansions. Improved governance could bolster the credibility and thus
the effectiveness of fiscal stimulus. Recognizing
the pros and cons of these approaches, I do feel
they are worthy of consideration.
Finally, Chapter 6 tries to solve an important
puzzle: Why have the current account balances
of emerging economies been so divergent in
recent years, with some economies in emerging Asia registering large surpluses and others,
particularly in emerging Europe, sustaining very
large and long-lasting deficits? There is no single

xiv

answer, but the chapter suggests that important
contributors have been emerging Europe’s rapid
financial liberalization and capital account opening, particularly in those economies integrating rapidly into the European Union, and the
focus in emerging Asia on building large stocks
of international reserves as self-insurance in
the wake of the Asian crisis of 1997–98. This
leaves open the question of whether the recent
patterns will be sustained. Certainly the turbulent global environment is putting a strain on
economies with large current account deficits
and commensurately large external financing
requirements.

Executive Summary

The world economy is entering a major downturn
in the face of the most dangerous financial shock in
mature financial markets since the 1930s. Global
growth is projected to slow substantially in 2008, and
a modest recovery would only begin later in 2009.
Inflation is high, driven by a surge in commodity
prices, but is expected to moderate. The situation is
exceptionally uncertain and subject to considerable
downside risks. The immediate policy challenge is to
stabilize financial conditions, while nursing economies through a period of slow activity and keeping
inflation under control.

Global Economy under Stress
After years of strong growth, the world
economy is decelerating quickly (Chapters 1
and 2). Global activity is being buffeted by an
extraordinary financial shock and by still-high
energy and other commodity prices. Many
advanced economies are close to or moving into
recession, while growth in emerging economies
is also weakening.
The financial crisis that first erupted with the
U.S. subprime mortgage collapse in August 2007
has deepened further in the past six months
and entered a tumultuous new phase in September. The impact has been felt across the global
financial system, including in emerging markets
to an increasing extent. Intensifying solvency
concerns have led to emergency resolutions of
major U.S. and European financial institutions
and have badly shaken confidence. In response,
the U.S. and European authorities have taken
extraordinary measures aimed at stabilizing
markets, including massive liquidity provision,
prompt intervention to resolve weak institutions, extension of deposit insurance, and recent
U.S. legislation to use public funds to purchase
troubled assets from banks. However, the situation remains highly uncertain as this report goes
to press.

At the same time, the combination of the
surge in food and fuel prices under way since
2004 and tightening capacity constraints has
propelled inflation to rates not seen in a decade.
As analyzed in Chapter 3, consumer price rises
have been particularly strong in emerging and
developing economies. This acceleration reflects
the high weight of food in consumption baskets,
still-quite-rapid growth, and less-well-anchored
inflation expectations. Notably, countries that
have adopted inflation-targeting regimes have
generally fared better. In the advanced economies, oil price increases have pushed up headline inflation, but underlying inflation pressures
seem contained.
The recent deterioration of global economic
performance follows sustained expansion built
on the increasing integration of emerging and
developing economies into the global economy.
In hindsight, however, lax macroeconomic and
regulatory policies may have allowed the global
economy to exceed its “speed limit” and may
have contributed to a buildup in imbalances
across financial, housing, and commodity markets. At the same time, market flaws, together
with policy shortcomings, have prevented equilibrating mechanisms from operating effectively
and allowed market stresses to build.

Recovery Not Yet in Sight and Likely to
Be Gradual When It Comes
Looking ahead, financial conditions are
likely to remain very difficult, restraining global
growth prospects. The baseline projections
assume that actions by the U.S. and European
authorities will succeed in stabilizing financial
conditions and avoiding further systemic events.
Nonetheless, even with successful implementation of the U.S. plan to remove troubled assets
from bank balance sheets, counterparty risk is
likely to remain at exceptionally high levels for

xv

Executive Summary

some time, slowing down the return to more
liquid conditions in key financial markets.
Furthermore, additional credit losses are very
likely as the global economy decelerates. In this
setting, financial institutions’ ability to raise new
capital will remain very challenged. Accordingly,
as discussed in the October 2008 Global Financial
Stability Report, the required deleveraging will
continue to be a protracted process, implying
that limits on the pace of credit creation—and
on activity—will be present at least through
2009.
Nonetheless, several factors are expected to
lay the groundwork for a gradual recovery to
emerge later in 2009:
• Commodity prices are projected to stabilize,
albeit at 20-year highs. The adverse termsof-trade effects of the more than 50 percent
increase in oil prices during 2008 should
begin to unwind in 2009, boosting consumption in oil-importing countries.
• The U.S. housing sector is expected to finally
reach bottom in the coming year, ending the
intense drag on growth that has been present since 2006. The eventual stabilization of
house prices should help restrain the financial
sector’s mortgage-related losses, and the recent
intervention in the two government-sponsored
enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,
should help support the availability of credit to
the housing sector. Although the housing cycle
and related adjustment might lag in other
advanced economies, the overall impact of the
financial crisis will be severely felt.
• Notwithstanding cooling of their momentum,
emerging economies are still expected to
provide a source of resilience, benefiting from
strong productivity growth and improved
policy frameworks. Of course, the longer the
financial crisis lasts, the more they are likely
to be affected.
Against this backdrop, the baseline growth
projections have been marked down significantly relative to the July 2008 World Economic
Outlook Update. On an average annual basis,
global growth is expected to moderate from
5.0 percent in 2007 to 3.9 percent in 2008 and

xvi

3.0 percent in 2009, its slowest pace since 2002.
The advanced economies would be in or close
to recession in the second half of 2008 and early
2009, and the anticipated recovery later in 2009
will be exceptionally gradual by past standards.
Growth in most emerging and developing
economies would decelerate below trend. On
the inflation front, the combination of rising slack and stabilizing commodity prices is
expected to contain the pace of price increases,
bringing inflation back below 2 percent in 2009
in advanced economies. In emerging and developing economies, inflation would ebb more
gradually, as recent commodity price increases
continue to feed through to consumers.
There are substantial downside risks to this
baseline forecast. The principal risk revolves
around two related financial concerns: that
financial stress could remain very high and that
credit constraints from deleveraging could be
deeper and more protracted than envisaged
in the baseline. In addition, the U.S. housing market deterioration could be deeper and
more prolonged than forecast, while European
housing markets could weaken more broadly.
Inflation risks to growth are now more balanced
because commodity prices have retreated as the
global economy slows. At the same time, potential disruptions to capital flows and the risks of
rising protectionism represent additional risks to
the recovery.
The connections between financial stress and
economic downturns are explored in Chapter 4,
which compares recent experience to earlier
episodes. The analysis indicates that financial
stress that is rooted in the banking sector typically has more adverse economic effects than
stress in stock markets or exchange rates and
that the shift toward more-arm’s-length financial
intermediation may have increased the impact.
Initial conditions appear to affect the outcomes. Thus, the relatively healthy nonfinancial
corporate balance sheets in the United States
and western Europe at the beginning of the
current downturn provide a source of resilience,
but would be at risk from a sustained period of
financial stress.

Executive Summary

Chapter 6 raises concerns about countries
with sustained large current account deficits.
These concerns may be particularly relevant
as global deleveraging reduces the availability
of external financing for emerging economies.
The analysis seeks to explain large divergences in current account behavior across the
emerging world and relates the large deficits
in emerging Europe to capital account liberalization, financial reform, and opportunities
created by European economic convergence.
However, sustained large deficits can end
abruptly, and rigid exchange regimes heighten
such risks. In fact, many economies with large
current account deficits have already experienced a much greater impact from the financial
market turmoil than those with small current
account deficits or surpluses.

Policymakers between a Rock and a
Hard Place
Policymakers around the world today face the
daunting task of stabilizing financial conditions
while simultaneously nursing their economies
through a period of slower growth and containing inflation. Multilateral efforts take on particular importance in current circumstances,
including policy initiatives to remedy the financial turmoil, alleviate the tightness in commodity markets, and support low-income economies
burdened by high food import bills.
Country authorities are actively pursuing
policies intended to stabilize financial conditions. Achieving this daunting task will require
comprehensive responses that address the
systemic problems––dealing with troubled
assets, fostering the rebuilding of bank capital,
and restoring liquid conditions in funding
markets—while being mindful of taxpayer
interests and moral hazard considerations.
Approaches at the national level should be
internationally coordinated to deal with joint
problems and to avoid creating adverse, crossborder incentives.
The U.S. initiative to purchase real-estaterelated assets should help over time to reduce

the pressure on banks from distressed assets,
and thus support a return of stable funding sources and confidence. However, public
funds are also likely to be needed to help
banks rebuild their capital bases. In western
Europe, restoring confidence now requires a
decisive commitment to concerted and coordinated action to facilitate timely recognition of
troubled assets and bank recapitalization. A key
task will be to develop cooperative agreements,
adapted to a broad range of circumstances,
including for resolving stress in large crossborder institutions and ensuring consistency in
approaches to expanding deposit insurance.
Macroeconomic policies in the advanced
economies should aim at supporting activity,
thus helping to break the negative feedback
loop between real and financial conditions,
while not losing sight of inflation risks.
• Rapidly slowing activity and rising output
gaps should help contain inflation. Moderating inflation pressure and the deteriorating
economic outlook already provide scope for
monetary easing in some cases, notably in the
euro area and the United Kingdom, where
short-term interest rates are quite high.
• Regarding fiscal policy, automatic stabilizers play a useful role in buffering shocks to
activity and should be left to operate freely,
provided that adjustment paths are consistent
with long-term sustainability. Discretionary
fiscal stimulus can provide support to growth
in the event that downside risks materialize,
provided the stimulus is delivered in a timely
manner, is well targeted, and does not undermine fiscal sustainability. In the current
circumstances, available fiscal room should
be focused on supporting stabilization of
the financial and housing sectors as needed,
rather than for more broad-brush stimulus.
In due course, offsetting adjustments to fiscal
policies will be needed to safeguard mediumterm consolidation objectives.
Macroeconomic policy priorities vary considerably across emerging and developing
economies, as policymakers balance growth and
inflation risks.

xvii

Executive Summary

• In an increasing number of economies,
the balance of risks has now shifted toward
concern about slowing activity as external
conditions deteriorate and headline inflation
starts to moderate. This shift would justify a
halt to the monetary policy tightening cycle,
particularly where second-round effects on
inflation from commodity prices have been
limited, and a turn to easing would be called
for if the outlook continues to deteriorate.
In the face of sharp capital outflows, countries will need to respond quickly to ensure
adequate liquidity, while using the exchange
rate to absorb some of the pressure. Furthermore, they should step up efforts to improve
capabilities to prevent, manage, and resolve
financial stress, including through contingency planning.
• However, in a number of other countries,
inflation pressures are still a concern because
of sharp food price increases, continued
strong growth, tightening supply constraints,
and accelerating wages, notably in the public
sector. Although the recent moderation in
international commodity prices may ease
some of the pressure, the gains in reducing
inflation in recent years are being jeopardized; once credibility is eroded, rebuilding it
will be a costly and lengthy process. In these
countries, additional monetary policy tightening may still be called for.
• Countries with heavily managed exchange rate
regimes are facing significant challenges. More
flexible exchange rates would help contain
inflation pressures by providing greater scope
for monetary adjustment and provide more
room for maneuver in the face of capital outflows. Of course, other considerations feed into
choices of exchange rate regimes, including,
for example, the degree of financial development and the diversity of the export base.
• Fiscal policy can play a supportive role in macroeconomic management. Greater restraint
in public spending would help ease inflation pressures in a number of countries still
facing overheating concerns. This is particularly important for current account deficit

xviii

countries with pegged exchange rates. In
the oil-exporting economies with currencies
pegged to the U.S. dollar, spending can be
focused on relieving supply bottlenecks. While
emerging economies have greater scope than
in the past to use countercyclical fiscal policy
should their economic outlook deteriorate,
the analysis in Chapter 5 cautions that this is
unlikely to be effective unless confidence in
sustainability has been firmly established and
measures are timely and well targeted. More
broadly, general food and fuel subsidies have
become increasingly costly and are inherently
inefficient. Targeted programs that help poor
families meet rising living expenses are a preferred option.

Policy Frameworks in Need of Reform
The deteriorating performance of the global
economy has raised concerns about the choice
of macroeconomic policy frameworks and the
appropriateness of policies affecting financial
and commodity markets.

Operationalizing “Leaning against the Wind”
The current exceptional environment has
heightened interest in developing policies that
would be better geared toward avoiding asset
price booms and busts, including through stronger policy responses in boom times. A promising
approach would be to introduce a macroprudential element into the regulatory framework
to weigh against the inherent procyclicality of
credit creation. Consideration could also be
given to extending monetary policy frameworks
to provide for “leaning against the wind” of asset
price movements, especially when these are
rapid or seem to be moving prices seriously out
of line with fundamentals, although this raises
complex issues.
Moreover, interest has increased in making
fiscal policy frameworks more credible and thus
making fiscal policy more effective as a countercyclical tool. The Achilles heel of an active fiscal
policy remains political economy settings that

Executive Summary

foster short-term decision-making. As a result,
many countries fail during good times to build
room for effective discretionary stimulus during downturns, or are struggling with addressing long-term fiscal sustainability challenges.
Chapter 5 suggests that the shift toward more
rules-based policy frameworks—analogous to
constrained discretion in monetary policy—and
the stronger fiscal governance mechanisms that
can be observed in a growing number of countries could boost the effectiveness of fiscal policy
in combating downturns.

Plugging Gaps in Regulatory and Supervisory
Infrastructures
As well as dealing with the immediate systemic
threats, determined efforts are being marshaled
to address the manifold weaknesses revealed by
the current financial turbulence. As laid out in
the October 2008 Global Financial Stability Report,
a central objective is to ensure more effective
and resilient risk management by individual
institutions, including by setting more robust
regulatory capital requirements and insisting
on stronger liquidity management practices and
improved disclosure of on- and off-balance-sheet
risk. Another important task is to strengthen
crisis resolution frameworks.
Moreover, the financial turmoil has revealed
that national financial stability frameworks have
failed to keep up with financial market innovation and globalization, at the price of deleterious cross-border spillovers. Greater cross-border
coordination and collaboration among national
prudential authorities are needed, particularly
for the purposes of preventing, managing, and
resolving financial stress both in markets and in
major financial institutions.

Fostering Energy Conservation and Greater Oil
and Food Supply
The recent decline in commodity prices
should not detract from efforts to relieve strains
in commodity markets. There is little concrete
evidence that rising investor interest in com-

modities as an alternative asset—or outright
speculation—had a systematic or lasting impact
on prices. However, the combination of unusual
swings in market sentiment and greater financial
market liquidity may have contributed to shortterm price dynamics in some circumstances.
Accordingly, the focus should be on policies
to encourage better balance between supply
and demand in the longer term and to avoid
measures that could exacerbate market tightness
in the short term. This could include greater
pass-through of international price changes to
domestic markets and greater energy conservation. Lower biofuel subsidies in the advanced
economies could also relieve short-term pressures on food prices. In general, priority should
be given to strengthening the supply response
to higher prices. For now, greater donor support
for the poorest economies will be crucial to
address the humanitarian challenges raised by
the surge in food prices.

Unwinding Global Imbalances
The surge in commodity prices has led to
a further widening in global imbalances, with
wider current account surpluses in oil exporters
and larger deficits in oil importers. Of course,
exporters’ intent to save some of the additional
revenues is sensible: to date, the associated recycling of funding from surplus to deficit countries is working well. At the same time, the U.S.
non-oil deficit has fallen substantially, in part
reflecting the depreciation of the U.S. currency
back toward a real effective rate that is broadly
consistent with medium-term equilibrium.
However, U.S. dollar depreciation has occurred
mainly against the euro and some other flexibly
managed currencies.
The multilateral strategy endorsed by the
International Monetary and Financial Committee in 2005 and elaborated by the Multilateral
Consultation on Global Imbalances in 2006 and
2007 remains relevant but needs to be applied
flexibly. U.S. fiscal consolidation remains a key
medium-term objective, but recent countercyclical fiscal stimulus and public support to stabixix

Executive Summary

lize financial institutions have been warranted.
Further effective appreciation of the renminbi
would contribute to China’s broader strategy
to shift the sources of growth toward internal demand and to increase the effectiveness
of monetary policy. A slowdown in spending
growth in Middle Eastern oil exporters would
help reduce overheating in their economies, as
would a heightened focus on relieving supply
bottlenecks. At the same time, product and
labor market reforms in the euro area and
Japan would raise potential growth.
Finally, rising protectionist pressures on
both trade and capital flows reflect a worrisome risk to the prospective recovery. Breaking the current Doha Round deadlock would

xx

help strengthen the open multilateral trading
system, an important underpinning of strong
global growth in recent years. At the same time,
sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) continue to grow
as investment vehicles for surplus countries. The
set of principles and practices recently agreed
by SWFs for their governance, investment, and
risk management (the “Santiago Principles”)
will contribute to reducing concerns about these
types of funds that could lead to counterproductive restrictions on such inflows. Moreover,
guidelines for recipient countries, which are
under development at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, would
help reassure the SWFs of fair, transparent, and
open access to markets.

Global Prospects and Policies

The world economy is now entering a major downturn
in the face of the most dangerous shock in mature
financial markets since the 1930s. Against an exceptionally uncertain background, global growth projections for 2009 have been marked down to 3 percent,
the slowest pace since 2002, and the outlook is subject
to considerable downside risks. The major advanced
economies are already in or close to recession, and,
although a recovery is projected to take hold progressively in 2009, the pickup is likely to be unusually
gradual, held back by continued financial market
deleveraging. In this context, elevated rates of headline
inflation should recede quickly, provided oil prices stay
at or below current levels. The emerging and developing
economies are also slowing, in many cases to rates well
below trend, although some still face significant inflation pressure even with more stable commodity prices.
The immediate policy challenge is to stabilize global
financial markets, while nursing economies through a
global downturn and keeping inflation under control.
Over a longer horizon, policymakers will be looking to
rebuild firm underpinnings for financial intermediation and will be considering how to reduce procyclical
tendencies in the global economy and strengthen supplydemand responses in commodity markets.

T

his chapter opens with an overview of
a global economy under stress. It then
examines the expanding financial crisis
and its macroeconomic implications in
more detail, as well as the imbalances in housing
and commodity markets. This analysis sets the
stage for the discussion of the outlook and risks.
The final part of the chapter discusses the policy
challenges. Chapter 2 looks in more detail at
developments and policy issues in each of the
world’s main regions.

Global Economy under Stress
For four years through the summer of 2007,
the global economy boomed. Global GDP rose

at an average of about 5 percent a year, its highest sustained rate since the early 1970s. About
three-fourths of this growth (measured on a purchasing-power-parity basis) was attributable to a
broad-based surge in the emerging and developing economies (Table 1.1 and Figure 1.1). Inflation remained generally contained, albeit with
some upward drift.
Over the past year, the global economy has
been buffeted by the deepening crisis in financial markets, by major corrections in housing
markets in a number of advanced economies,
and by surges in commodity prices. Indeed, the
financial crisis that erupted in August 2007 after
the collapse of the U.S. subprime mortgage
market entered a tumultuous new phase in September 2008 that has badly shaken confidence
in global financial institutions and markets. Most
dramatically, intensifying solvency concerns have
triggered a cascading series of bankruptcies,
forced mergers, and public interventions in the
United States and western Europe, which has
resulted in a drastic reshaping of the financial
landscape. Moreover, interbank markets have
virtually locked up as trust in counterparties
has evaporated. Responding rapidly, the U.S.
and European authorities have announced
far-reaching measures aimed at supporting key
institutions, stabilizing markets, and bolstering
confidence, but markets remains highly unsettled and volatile as this report goes to press.
Faced by increasingly difficult conditions,
the global economy has slowed markedly. The
advanced economies grew at a collective annualized rate of only 1 percent during the period
from the fourth quarter of 2007 through the
second quarter of 2008, down from 2½ percent
during the first three quarters of 2007. The
U.S. economy has suffered most from the direct
effects of the financial crisis that originated in
its own subprime mortgage market, which has
tightened credit conditions and amplified the

Global Economy under Stress

housing correction that has been under way
since 2006. Aggressive policy easing by the Federal Reserve, a timely fiscal stimulus package,
and strong export performance on the back of
a weakening U.S. dollar have helped cushion
these blows, but the economy has still managed
to grow by only 1¼ percent on average since
the fourth quarter of 2007. Activity in western
Europe has also slowed appreciably, dampened
by high oil prices, tightening credit conditions,
housing downturns in several economies, the
U.S. slowdown, and the appreciating euro.
Japan’s economy initially showed more resilience but has recently been affected by slowing
exports and the impact of deteriorating terms of
trade on domestic demand.
Available data for the third quarter and forward-looking indicators suggest that the downturn in the advanced economies is continuing
to deepen (Figure 1.2). Indeed, business and
consumer confidence indicators for the United
States and the euro area are now close to lows
experienced during the 2001–02 recession.
The emerging and developing economies
have not decoupled from this downturn. Growth
in these countries eased from 8 percent in the
first three quarters of 2007 to 7½ percent in the
subsequent three quarters, as domestic demand
(particularly business investment) and net
exports have moderated. Moreover, recent trade
and business activity indicators are signaling continuing deceleration. Growth has been most resilient in commodity-exporting countries, which
are benefiting from still-high export prices. By
contrast, countries with the strongest trade links
with the United States and Europe are slowing
markedly, while some countries that relied on
bank-related or portfolio inflows to finance large
current account deficits have been hit hard by an
abrupt tightening of external financing. Nevertheless, as a group, emerging economies have so
far sustained market access better than in earlier
episodes of financial turbulence, reflecting
improvements in policy frameworks and stronger
public sector balance sheets.
Despite the deceleration of global growth,
headline inflation has risen around the world

Figure 1.1. Global Indicators1

(Annual percent change unless otherwise noted)
After four years of strong growth, the global economy is heading into a major
downturn, led by the advanced economies. At the same time, inflation has risen
to its highest rates in a decade, pushed up by a surge in commodity prices .

to the highest rates since the late 1990s, pushed
up by the surge in fuel and food prices. In
the advanced economies, 12‑month headline
inflation registered 4¼ percent in August 2008,
down modestly from a peak in July in the wake
of some commodity price easing (Figure 1.3).
Measures of underlying inflation—price indices
excluding food and fuel prices, inflation expectations, and labor costs—have been broadly
contained, although there has been upward
drift in some measures. Reflecting heightened
inflation concerns, the Federal Reserve has held
the federal funds rate at 2 percent since April,
after six months of steep cuts, and the European
Central Bank increased its policy rate one notch
to 4¼ percent in early July.
The resurgence in inflation has been more
marked in the emerging and developing economies, with headline inflation reaching 8¼ percent in the aggregate in August and with a wide
swath of countries now experiencing doubledigit inflation. To some extent, the difference
reflects the considerably greater weight of food
prices in consumption baskets in these economies—typically in the range of 30–45 percent
as opposed to 10–15 percent in the advanced
economies. However, inflation excluding food
and fuel has also accelerated markedly, and
there are signs of rising inflation expectations
and wage increases, although such data are not
as systematically available as in the advanced
economies. Chapter 3 looks at the relationship between commodity prices and inflation
and finds that emerging economies have been
more vulnerable to second‑round effects. This
is because the greater weight of food prices
has put more pressure on real wages, because
inflation expectations are less well anchored by
central bank credibility, and because fast growth
has eroded margins of spare capacity.
Policymakers in emerging and developing
economies have responded to rising inflation
with an eclectic mix of measures. Many central
banks have raised interest rates, but others have
relied more on increasing reserve requirements
and tightening credit, particularly where interest rate policy has been constrained by inflex-

Global Economy under Stress

ible exchange rate management. However, as
discussed below, some of these steps have been
reversed recently in the face of intense liquidity
strains related to recent financial turmoil. Some
countries have also tightened fiscal policies to
help restrain the growth of aggregate demand.
Going beyond macroeconomic policies, a number of countries have sought to limit the impact
of rising international commodity prices on
domestic prices by delaying or limiting the passthrough of oil prices—with a potentially heavy
fiscal cost—by lowering tariffs on imported food,
and in some cases by prohibiting or imposing
taxes on food exports.
The weakening of U.S. growth relative to its
trading partners and the sustained depreciation
of the U.S. dollar since 2002 helped lower the
U.S. current account deficit to 5 percent of GDP
in the first half of 2008, from 6½ percent in late
2005 (Figure 1.4). The decrease is even larger
if net oil imports are excluded. Despite some
strengthening since early 2008, the real effective
exchange rate of the U.S. dollar is at its lowest
level in decades, and the dollar is now assessed
to be broadly in line with medium-term fundamentals. The adjustment in the dollar in recent
years has largely come against other advanced
economy currencies, notably the euro (which is
now judged to be on the strong side of fundamentals) and the yen (which is still assessed to
be undervalued relative to fundamentals), as
well as other floating rate currencies.
Among emerging economies, China’s
exchange rate has continued to appreciate at a
moderate pace, with a somewhat faster rise in
real effective terms owing to the pickup in inflation (Figure 1.5). Nevertheless, China’s current
account surplus has remained above 10 percent
of GDP, and with strong capital inflows despite a
tightening of controls, reserves have continued
to mount. In the IMF staff’s view, the renminbi
remains substantially undervalued relative to
medium-term fundamentals. Many oil exporters in the Middle East have continued to peg
against the U.S. dollar. As a result, their nominal
effective exchange rates have tended to depreciate, although exchange rates have appreciated

Figure 1.3. Global Inflation

(Twelve-month change in the consumer price index unless otherwise
noted)
Headline inflation has surged, particularly in emerging and developing economies,
reflecting both a jump in food and fuel prices and a more general tightening of
capacity constraints. The advanced economies have also experienced a marked
acceleration of headline inflation, driven mainly by the pass-through of high
international oil prices, but indicators of underlying inflation have risen only
modestly.

moderately in real terms because of rising inflation. Elsewhere, experiences are quite diverse.
Currencies in emerging Europe and Latin
America have generally appreciated, as monetary policy has been tightened and commodity
exporters have benefited from terms-of-trade
gains, although some currencies have come
under pressure recently as commodity prices
softened and risk aversion increased. A number
of currencies in Africa and south and east Asia
(for example, India, Korea, Pakistan, and South
Africa) have depreciated over a longer period,
in part owing to rising costs of commodity
imports and widening current account deficits.

Financial System in Crisis
The April 2008 World Economic Outlook was
finalized just after the Federal Reserve engineered the emergency sale of a major U.S.
investment bank (Bear Stearns) and increased
broker-dealer access to emergency liquidity.
Banks also made progress in recognizing their
losses on subprime-mortgage-related exposures,
rebuilding their capital, and reducing their
leverage.
Despite these efforts, financial market strains
intensified again over the summer as solvency
concerns resurfaced and as it became clear that
the process of balance-sheet repair would be
protracted. Bank funding came under particular
stress (Figure 1.6). One source of pressure was
the increasing concern that credit losses were
mounting in the grip of a negative feedback
loop between the economy and the financial
system. At the same time, bank adjustment
was hampered by high funding costs, reduced
revenue streams from fee-based securitization
Financial sector developments are discussed in detail
in the October 2008 Global Financial Stability Report (IMF,
2008b).
As of September 2008, banks reported $518 billion in
losses on U.S. subprime mortgages and related exposure,
the lion’s share by U.S. and European banks. Banks also
raised $364 billion in new capital. These amounts compare to losses on U.S.-based loans and related securities
now estimated at $1.4 trillion, of which $640 billion–
$735 billion would correspond to banks (IMF, 2008b).

Financial System in Crisis

business, and forced accumulation of assets from
off-balance-sheet entities and prior loan commitments. Falling equity prices made raising
new capital increasingly expensive, often prohibitively so, while at the same time, markets as
well as regulators were looking for a significant
increase in capital-to-asset ratios to levels well
above those prevailing before the crisis.
Once more, the greatest strains have been
experienced by institutions heavily exposed to
the still-weakening U.S. housing market. Starting in August, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,
the two giant government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), came under heavy pressure over
concerns about the adequacy of their capital
bases in the face of rising losses, which were not
relieved by assurances from the U.S. authorities
that these two institutions would have access to
federal funding to meet their liquidity and capital needs. In light of the crucial current role of
these agencies in the U.S. housing market and
the global financial system, the two institutions
were placed under the conservatorship of the
U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency, with the
U.S. government pledging additional financial
support as needed to maintain adequate capital
and funding.
Notwithstanding these efforts, global financial
markets were plunged into turmoil in mid-September following the bankruptcy of a second
major U.S. investment bank (Lehman Brothers), involving significant losses to creditors and
counterparties. In the next few days, market
pressure drove the merger of another (Merrill
Lynch & Co.) with a large commercial bank and
the effective acquisition by the Federal Reserve
of the world’s largest insurance company
(American International Group, A.I.G.) to avoid
a disorderly bankruptcy. All of these institutions

Formally, the Federal National Mortgage Association
and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, respectively. The GSEs hold or guarantee about 50 percent of
U.S. mortgages and have supported 80 percent of new
mortgage lending in recent months. Moreover, their securities are held widely across the global financial system
and have provided a major conduit for external financing
of the U.S. current account deficit.

Figure 1.5. External Developments in Emerging
and Developing Economies
(Index, 2000 = 100, unless otherwise noted)
Exchange rate movements have recently been quite diverse across emerging and
developing economies. A number of oil-importing countries in Asia, especially those
with close trade ties to the United States, have experienced currency depreciation,
while China's currency has continued to appreciate. Currencies in Latin America and
emerging Europe have also generally remained buoyant, although weakening recently.

were heavily exposed to mortgage-related losses.
As confidence in counterparties all but vanished,
interbank markets effectively seized up, despite
coordinated injections of massive liquidity by
major central banks and agreement on foreign
exchange swaps of unprecedented magnitude.
Subsequently, a number of other U.S. and
European banks needed to be resolved through
closure, nationalization, or merger with public
support.
The authorities in the United States and
Europe responded to this firestorm with a series
of new initiatives. Notably, in early October, legislation was passed in the United States to set up
a $700 billion fund to purchase troubled mortgage-related securities from banks in order to
contain risks of further losses from this source,
encourage the development of more transparent
pricing of these assets, and reduce illiquidity on
bank balance sheets. At the same time, depositguarantee schemes were extended in the United
States and a number of European countries,
including a temporary guarantee for U.S. money
market funds and a guarantee for creditors as
well as depositors in Ireland. Restrictions also
were imposed on short-selling of financial stocks
to alleviate speculative pressure.
As this report goes to press, financial conditions continue to be under extraordinary stress.
Interbank markets remain highly disrupted
beyond overnight maturities, equity prices have
fallen sharply, and market volatility continues
to be at a high pitch (Figure 1.7). Moreover,
market sectors that had been less affected by the
turmoil have come under substantial increased
pressure, including the nonfinancial corporate
sector and emerging markets, as outlined in
Box 1.1. Amid this turbulence, government
securities have been viewed as a safe haven; U.S.
Treasury bill yields were driven to close to zero.
Intensifying financial strains are beginning
to take an increasingly heavy toll on economic
activity. One of the main channels for such
macrofinancial linkage is through tightening
bank lending standards in both the United
States and western Europe (see Figure 1.6). This
has occurred in response to banks’ efforts to

Financial System in Crisis

decrease their leverage in the face of reduced
market tolerance for balance-sheet risk, increasingly expensive bank capital, and reduced access
to wholesale funding. Actual credit growth was
sustained for a while by the reintermediation
of off-balance-sheet exposure and prior lending
commitments, but credit growth is now slowing
visibly both to the nonfinancial corporate sector
as well as to households, and this winding back
of credit is likely to continue until bank capitalization is raised substantially. It is also clear that
financing through securities markets is likely to
remain highly constrained for higher-risk borrowers as spreads have widened and securitization has fallen dramatically.
The financial crisis is increasingly affecting
emerging markets too, reflecting rising risk aversion among investors, the reduced availability
of funding for leveraged investors like hedge
funds, and a weakening of growth prospects
in emerging economies. Local money markets
have experienced particular pressures, prompting central banks in a number of countries to
ease reserve requirements and to take other
actions to reduce strains on liquidity. Moreover,
equity prices have fallen sharply, and spreads
on both sovereign and corporate paper have
widened markedly (Figure 1.8). Countries with
large external financing needs and commodity
exporters facing the prospect of lower prices
have faced particular pressure from the reversal
of capital flows. Nevertheless, looking back over
the past year, overall capital flows to emerging
economies have been quite resilient, certainly by
past standards. Against this background, private
credit growth has continued to be rapid in many
of these economies, and domestic interest rates
have declined in real terms as rising inflation
has outstripped increases in policy rates.
The concerns expressed in the April 2008
World Economic Outlook about the impact of
sustained tight credit conditions on economic
activity remain highly relevant. These concerns have been reinforced by the analysis in
Chapter 4, which outlines how past episodes of
financial stress involving shocks to the banking
sector have typically been followed by deeper-

Financial strains are being reflected in a sharp correction in equity prices and
sustained high volatility in equity and currency markets. Property price dynamics
have continued to weaken, most notably in the United States, but also in France,
Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom.

Emerging market conditions have been affected increasingly by financial strains in
mature markets. Equity prices have dropped sharply in recent months, spreads have
widened, and new issues have moderated from last year’s highs. At the same time,
domestic interest rates have been increased in response to rising inflation, but real
rates have declined. Although private credit growth has moderated some, it remains
high.

than-usual business-cycle downturns and more
protracted recoveries. The main transmission
channel from financial sector shocks to downturns in activity seems to be a contraction in net
lending to the business and household sectors.
Chapter 4 points out that the growing role of
securities markets and of arm’s-length financing
has not in fact reduced the vulnerability of the
economy in the face of banking stress and presents evidence suggesting that the impact could
be even larger because of procyclical swings in
leverage.
One important lesson from Chapter 4 is that
the extent of damage to the economy depends
on the initial strength of corporate and household financial positions and housing price developments. The U.S. economy seems particularly
vulnerable because household balance sheets
are stretched and the housing sector is undergoing a major correction. The relatively strong
initial position of the U.S. corporate sector and
the rapid shift toward monetary easing are identified as mitigating factors. Western European
economies should gain some protection from
the strong position of households, but would
nevertheless also be at considerable risk from a
sustained period of financial stress.

Deepening Housing Corrections
Financial factors have interacted in important ways with housing cycles to amplify the
extent of housing booms and busts and procyclical swings in leverage. The historic housing
booms experienced in the United States and
many western European economies since the
early years of this decade had their origin in
falling real interest rates, strong growth, and
in some cases rapid immigration. However, the
expansion was also fueled by new financing
techniques based on securitization and weakening lending standards, particularly in the
United States. By 2006, more than 40 percent
Dell’Ariccia,

Igan, and Laeven (2008) document how
the weakening of lending standards contributed to the
deterioration of credit quality in the U.S. subprime sector.

Box 1.1. The Latest Bout of Financial Distress: How Does It Change the Global Outlook?
Since the beginning of the financial crisis in
mid-2007, the World Economic Outlook baseline
forecast has envisaged that financial strains
would be protracted and would take a significant toll on economic activity. However, the
resilience of the nonfinancial corporate sector
in advanced economies and the momentum of
growth in emerging economies were expected
to cushion the impact on global growth. Data
through mid-September 2008 were broadly
consistent with this assessment. With the financial crisis entering a new, more severe stage
in September 2008, the question arises as to
whether the likely course of the global economy
has changed. This box specifically explores how
the nonfinancial corporate sector in advanced
economies and emerging markets have been
affected by the latest financial events, highlighting mounting risks to these segments of the
global economy.
The latest stage of the financial crisis started
in September 2008, when several systemically
important U.S. financial institutions abruptly
exited the market. Lehman Brothers’ decision
to file for bankruptcy, in particular, reverberated across global financial markets, exacerbating the severe contraction in market liquidity
and heightening concerns about counterparty
risks. The cost of U.S. dollar funding surged
globally, and other money markets also came
under severe strain. As investors’ appetite for
risk declined, pressures extended to emerging
markets, particularly to Russia, which faced
a confluence of shocks. The global financial
turmoil has been met with a far-reaching public
response. However, financial markets remain
under strain, and confidence is still fragile.
Major structural shifts in the U.S. financial sector, which took place during this latest stage of
the crisis, have intensified and broadened the
deleveraging process, laying the groundwork for
a further downsizing of the financial sector.

Note: The authors of this box are Andreas Jobst
and Natalia Tamirisa.

A worrying aspect of this latest bout of turbulence is that there are now increasing signs that
market strains are starting to fall more heavily
on the nonfinancial corporate sector and on
emerging markets. If sustained, such strains
could well foreshadow a more severe macroeconomic impact of the financial crisis than
previously anticipated.
The nonfinancial sector in advanced economies is now more broadly affected than during
the earlier stages of the crisis. Spreads on highgrade nonfinancial corporate bonds, which have
risen gradually since the beginning of the crisis,
rose further during the latest round of turbulence (first figure). They now stand at almost
double the 2002 peaks and indicate a default
risk comparable to that of emerging market
sovereign debt. Low-grade corporate spreads
also surged, but they remain below the historical highs of 2002. Access to short-term financing
has tightened and equity prices have declined
(upper panel of second figure), although equity
prices still remain above previous troughs.
The recent surge in borrowing costs for
nonfinancial firms has taken place against
the backdrop of a gradual worsening of their
risk profiles over the course of the financial
crisis. The market-based measures of default
risk and leverage ratios have risen across the
credit spectrum in both the United States
and Europe—not only for low-grade bonds, as
would be expected during a slowdown, but for
high-grade bonds too (middle panel of second
figure). For high-grade corporate bonds in the

1The corporate bond spreads are derived as the difference between the asset swap spread and the commensurate London interbank
offered rate. The sovereign bond spread series for advanced markets is a composite of the five-year U.S. Treasury rate over the effective
federal funds rate and the five-year German Bund over the EONIA rate (i.e., the effective European Central Bank policy rate).

United States, for example, the probability of
default has doubled since June 2007, although
it remains below the levels experienced in
2004, in part owing to strong corporate balance
sheets, particularly, ample internal funds.
Why are high-grade nonfinancial firms being
affected more severely during the current crisis
than during the previous major decline in
financial markets in 2000–02, following the collapse of the dot-com bubble? A possible general
explanation relates to differences between the
shocks that triggered the respective downturns.

Earlier

data are not available.

The current downturn has its roots in the
financial sector, where the originate-to-distribute
model largely ceased to function. The financial
shock is being transmitted to the nonfinancial
sector via tighter financing conditions and,
more recently, a drying up of market liquidity.
The ubiquity of these channels leaves little room
for differentiation across the credit spectrum. In
contrast, the dot-com bubble originated in the
nonfinancial sector, notably high-yield corporate
credit, and was transmitted mainly through the
solvency channel, affecting low-grade nonfinancial corporate bonds to an appreciably larger
extent than high-grade ones. A more specific
reason for increased pressures on high-grade

nonfinancial firms relates to a growing concern
about their rollover risk during the current
crisis, because refinancing plans have led to a
bunching of maturing bond obligations over the
coming years, while bank financing has tightened. Moreover, declines in equity prices have
increased the cost of raising capital.
The cost of borrowing for emerging markets
has also increased further in recent weeks,
although it remais below the peaks during
2001–02 and the Asian crisis of 1997–98. There
has been a sharp and broad-based retrenchment from emerging market assets as a result
of investors’ reduced appetite for risk and their
need to sell assets to raise cash in response
to margin calls. Idiosyncratic risks are rising. Emerging Europe and Latin America are
experiencing the largest declines in sovereign
and corporate bond returns, while the effect
on emerging Asian assets has been more
muted (see upper panel of second figure). The
increased differentiation in credit markets
according to countries’ financing needs points
to a heightened risk of sudden stops in capital

Box 1.1 (concluded)
flows and currency crises in vulnerable emerging economies (third figure).
Since the beginning of the crisis, corporate
spreads for emerging economies have risen
above sovereign spreads (see first figure), suggesting that investors consider the emerging
market nonfinancial sector to be more vulnerable than the public sector, possibly owing to
their more limited domestic finance opportunities, higher leverage, and greater rollover risks
compared with sovereigns. The latter are perceived to be more protected, including by high
official international reserves and improved
public sector balance sheets.
As in advanced economies, the recent
increase in emerging market corporate spreads
comes on the heels of an earlier weakening in
the risk profiles of nonfinancial firms, in part
owing to slower growth (see lower panels of
second figure). Market-based default probabilities have nearly tripled since the beginning of the crisis for both high- and low-grade
bonds, although they remain below recent
peaks. High-grade nonfinancial corporates
from emerging Asia currently have the highest
default probabilities, reflecting the fact that
they have the highest market-based leverage
ratios in the respective subgroup. This is partly
due to increased external corporate borrowing
on the back of appreciating currencies in the
past two years. In the low-grade segment, Latin
American corporate bonds have the highest
leverage ratios.

of new U.S. mortgages were nonprime mortgages, often with very high loan-to-value ratios
and minimal documentation. In European
countries, there is less evidence of declining
lending standards, but, as in the United States,
in several countries the availability of housing
finance was sustained through the increased
availability of wholesale financing, involving
serious liquidity mismatches in some cases.
The subsequent downswing in the U.S.
housing market has been the largest of the

14

Nonetheless, corporate spreads and emerging
sovereign spreads remain well below the levels
experienced after the Asian crisis, the Argentine default, and the dot-com collapse (see first
figure). One reason is that emerging economies
have become more resilient to external financing
shocks because of larger international reserves,
higher revenues from commodities, and more
robust domestic demand. Another reason is
that emerging economies are facing a lessdirect shock: the collapse of the dot-com bubble
revolved around a technological innovation that
was shared more broadly across the world than
the originate-to-distribute banking model, and the
Asian crisis originated in emerging economies.
In sum, the latest stage of the financial crisis
has seen a further steady weakening in corporate and emerging economies’ positions.
Whether this deterioration will be sustained is
unclear at the moment. Markets remain exceptionally volatile, and it is difficult to predict how
long this volatility will persist. The longer the
turmoil lasts, the more entrenched the feedback
loop between the financial and real sectors
will become and the more broadly real sectors
across the world will suffer. This, together with
intensified and broadened deleveraging, would
delay the recovery and increase the likelihood
of a global recession. Accordingly, recent developments suggest that the outlook for global
growth has weakened considerably as a result of
recent events and that the downside risks to the
baseline forecast have increased.

postwar period, as housing activity and prices
have both fallen steeply. The downswing has
been exacerbated by the virtual disappearance
of the subprime market, a general tightening
of lending standards, increasing spreads on
conventional mortgages despite monetary easing (due to the deteriorating financial situation
of the GSEs), and sharply rising foreclosures.
In western Europe, housing cycles have also
turned down recently, in some cases because
lending standards have been tightened and

Overstretched Commodity Markets

credit has become more expensive. The most
severe downswings have been concentrated in
a few national markets—Ireland, Spain, and
the United Kingdom—which had experienced
the most rapid house price appreciation or the
greatest building booms, but house prices are
slowing more broadly (see Figure 1.7, lower panels). IMF staff analysis of house price valuations
provided in Box 1.2 suggests that, after allowing
for the impact of key fundamentals, houses continue to appear overvalued across a broad range
of advanced economies, although prices in the
United States are now moving closer in line with
past relationships.
As discussed in Box 1.2, housing downturns
can have a strong negative impact on growth
through a range of channels. Most directly,
the contraction of residential investment has
subtracted ¾ percentage point a year from U.S.
growth over the past two years, and similar
retrenchments are having an even larger impact
in Ireland and Spain. In addition, the heavy and
continuing losses from mortgage-related assets—
both direct losses through rising loan delinquencies and indirect losses on mortgage-backed
assets being marked to market—have been a
central driver of the financial crisis and the
related tightening of credit conditions. Finally,
there is the negative impact of declining house
prices on opportunities for borrowing using
housing collateral, as well as possible wealth
effects. While consumption has been quite resilient in the United States, in part because of tax
rebates, it is now slowing fast.

Overstretched Commodity Markets
Commodity prices remain at much higher
levels in real terms than at any time in the past
20 years, despite some correction since mid-July
amid the slowdown of the global economy (see
Figure 1.1). Chapter 3 lays out evidence that
the driving force behind the sustained run-up
in commodity prices has been the tightness of
demand-supply balances for many key products
and realization that markets are likely to remain
tight for the foreseeable future, after many years

of ample spare capacity. Commodity demand
growth has essentially been driven by the continuing integration of large pools of low-income
labor, especially in Asia, into the global economy—groups with low per capita consumption
but high income elasticity of demand. Moreover,
the supply response to rising relative prices has
been sluggish, in part because of geological and
technological constraints, particularly in the oil
sector, in part because of lingering concerns
that oil prices may yet revert to the much lower
levels observed in the second half of the 1980s
and the 1990s, and in part because of policy
shortcomings that have discouraged investment
in new supply, for both energy and food. With
inventories low and spare capacity limited, and
with very low short-term supply-and-demand
price elasticities, commodity prices have become
highly sensitive to news about possible supply
disruptions or changing perceptions of cyclical
prospects. Thus, the recent softening in prices
seems to have been driven largely by perceptions that global growth is slowing and emerging
evidence of a demand response to high prices
(notably in the United States), as well as by
some favorable supply developments.
Some observers have suggested that recent
large commodity price swings are related to
speculation or increasing investment in commodities as assets, rather than to shifts in fundamentals affecting supply and demand. IMF staff
has found some evidence that the depreciation
of the U.S. dollar and declining U.S. interest rates have had an effect on prices through
their impact on supply and demand. However,
as discussed in Box 3.1, while limitations on
data availability make it hard to reach definitive
judgments, there is little concrete evidence that
rising speculation or increased investor interest
in commodities as alternative assets has had a
systematic or lasting impact on prices, although
swings in market sentiment may well have contributed to short-term price dynamics in some
circumstances.
The most immediate and direct macroeconomic impact of the boom in commodity prices
has been on inflation. As already mentioned and

Housing prices have begun falling this year
in several advanced economies, a sharp contrast
from the increase in prices seen during 2007 in
almost all countries except the United States,
where a housing correction has been under
way since 2006. In real terms, and on a seasonally adjusted basis, house prices fell in the first
half of 2008 at an annual rate of 5 percent to
12 percent in Canada, Denmark, Spain, New
Zealand, and the United Kingdom (first figure).
How much more are house prices likely to come
down? And what are the consequences of the
declines in house prices for the macroeconomy?
Corrections in house prices. As a basis for assessing the potential for house price declines, a first
step is to try to account for the increase in house
prices that has taken place over the past decade
in terms of important driving forces. To this end,
real house price growth is modeled as a function
of the following variables: growth in per capita
disposable income, working-age population,
credit and equity prices, and the level of shortterm and long-term interest rates. The dynamic
effects of these variables are captured through
the inclusion of lagged real house price growth
and an affordability ratio (the lagged ratio of
house prices to disposable incomes). This model
is estimated for each country using quarterly
data for the time period 1970 to 2007.
The increase in house prices not explained
by these fundamental factors—referred to as

the house price gap—is taken as an estimate of
the potential for correction in house prices. Of
course, the gap estimates could partly reflect
omitted fundamental factors, such as changes in
supply-side factors in the housing market. Nevertheless, the estimates provide an indication
of how large those omitted factors would have
The

models estimated here focus on explaining
Box1_2_1
short- to medium-run changes in house prices rather
than the long-run level of house prices, which could
differ considerably across countries, reflecting national
supply constraints and long-term institutional factors,
such as the extent of taxation of housing (Poterba,
1984). A study of European housing markets by Hilbers
and others (2008) provides a good exposition of the
role such factors can play in house price movements.

Overstretched Commodity Markets

As

noted in the 2008 IMF staff report for Australia, if some country­-specific factors, particularly the
impact of long-term migration on housing demand,
are taken into account, the results do not produce evidence of a significant overvalulation of house prices.
The 2008 IMF Article IV staff report for the Netherlands notes that the estimated house price gap—
estimated here as ranging from 9 to 15 percent—is
likely to be much smaller if the rise in single-person
households, which is very important in boosting housing demand in the Netherlands, is taken into account
along with institutional factors (for example, strict

to be for the rise in house prices over the past
years to be considered an equilibrium outcome.
The second figure shows the house price
gaps—the percent increase in house prices
during the period 1997 to end-2007 that is not
accounted for by fundamentals. Also shown, as
an indicator of the robustness of these results,
is the range of gap estimates generated by small
perturbations of the estimated models. These
changes include using the average value of
housing prices over 1994 to 1997, instead of the
1997 value, as the starting point for computing
the gap estimates; estimating a parsimonious
version of the model with only incomes and
interest rates as the driving forces; and changing
the dynamic specification by estimating a vector
autoregressive model for house prices instead of
a single-equation model.
The countries that have experienced the
largest unexplained increases in house prices
over the past decade are Australia, Ireland, and
the United Kingdom; house prices in these
countries were 20 percent to 30 percent higher
in 2007 than can be attributed to fundamentals.
A group of other countries—including France,
Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain—have house
price gaps of between 10 percent and 20 percent. The gap estimate for the United States—

about 7 percent—is smaller than for most other
countries and has been narrowing compared
with earlier estimates, partly reflecting the
decline in U.S. house prices over the past 18
months. The range of estimates for each coun-

cent, respectively. Recent IMF Article IV staff reports
that point to either a cooling of housing markets or
the onset of a correction include reports for Canada,
Korea, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, and the United
Kingdom. For Germany, some studies have found
higher undervaluation than the estimate of 5 percent
reported here, perhaps reflecting supply-side impacts
from social housing in post-reunification Germany.
Klyuev (2008) estimates that single-family homes in
the United States “remained 8 to 20 percent overvalued as of the first quarter of 2008.” The U.S. house
price gap was estimated at about 12 percent in 2007
(Box 3.1 in April 2008 World Economic Outlook) and
about 20 percent in 2006 (Box 2.1 in October 2007
World Economic Outlook).

17

Chapter 1   Global Prospects and Policies

Box 1.2 (continued)
try is about 3½ percent on average, though for
the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden the range
is considerably higher.
To put these gap estimates in perspective, it is
useful to compare them with house price cycles
in the advanced economies over the past several
decades (OECD, 2006). Between 1970 and
2005, the average house price cycle lasted about
10 years, with an expansion phase of 6 years during which real house prices increased by about
45 percent. During the subsequent four-year
contraction phase, real house prices declined
about 25 percent, with the range of declines
across countries varying from about 10 percent
in the United States to more than 30 percent in
Japan and several European countries.
Thus, if house price corrections were to occur
in line with the gaps shown in the second figure,
they would be well within the range of previous
experience. Moreover, the evidence indicates
that corrections typically occur over several
years. Evidence from countries with regional
(that is, subnational) data suggests that for some
regions, price-level corrections could be much
more pronounced and last longer than the
national cycle (Calomiris, Longhofer, and Miles,
2008; Estevão and Loungani, forthcoming).
Macroeconomic consequences. Experience during past housing market cycles can also be a
guide to the macroeconomic consequences of
these price corrections (Claessens, Kose, and
Terrones, forthcoming; World Economic Outlook,
April 2008 and April 2004). The evidence suggests, not surprisingly, that the consequences
are more adverse if they occur in the context of
a weakening economy and tight credit conditions, which is likely to be the situation facing
many countries at present. Over the period
1960 to the present, recessions in advanced
economies that are associated with house price
busts and credit crunches are slightly longer
and deeper than other recessions. The duration
of a recession is more than one quarter longer
in the case of a housing bust, total output loss
during the recession is somewhat higher, and
the unemployment rate increases notably more
and for longer in recessions with housing busts

18

(third figure, top panel). Over the 12 quarters
following the onset of a recession, the unemployment rate has increased on average by
1.5 percentage points. But in recessions associated with house price busts, the increase in
unemployment is 3 percentage points.
There is some evidence that this pattern
holds up at both the national and regional
levels. As shown in the lower panel of the third
figure, during regional recessions in the United
States that are associated with a house price
bust the peak impact on unemployment is an
increase of 4 percentage points, compared
with an increase of 2 percentage points for all
regional recessions (Estevão and Loungani,
forthcoming).
What about the impact of house price
declines on the components of output? There
is a growing literature on the possible impact
of changes in housing wealth on consumption. Buiter (2008) demonstrates that changes
in house prices are redistributions of wealth
and hence do not have much impact on net
wealth in the aggregate; however, they can
affect individual consumption by relaxing collateral constraints. Consistent with this point,
Muellbauer (2008) finds that with careful
modeling of the effect of credit market development and deregulation, which raises access to
housing collateral, changes in house prices have
a medium-run liquidity effect on U.S. and U.K.
consumption.
The impact on investment is more readily apparent. Claessens, Kose, and Terrones
(forthcoming) find that investment—residential
investment in particular—tends to fall more
sharply in recessions associated with housing
busts and with credit crunches than in other
recessions. There are also significant cross-

Benito

(2007) finds, using household-level data
for the United Kingdom, that it is much more common for withdrawal from home equity to flow into
residential investment than consumer spending, which
suggests that the collateral channel stressed by Buiter
(2008) and Muellbauer (2008) could be stronger for
investment than consumption.

country differences in the extent of the residential investment declines, which in principle
can depend on a wide range of characteristics
of national
financial and legal systems. One
box1_2_3
important dimension is the ease with which
households can access mortgage credit. This can
be measured either by the depth of mortgage
markets or by an index that summarizes the
institutional features of mortgage markets. The
mortgage market index incorporates features
such as the typical ratio of mortgage loans to
property values, the standard length of mortgage loans, the capacity to borrow against

accumulated home equity, and the degree of
development of secondary markets for mortgage loans. As shown in the top two panels of
the fourth figure, declines in residential investment have tended to be higher in countries
where households have had more access to
mortgage credit.
Other factors can play a role in explaining
the amplitude of the economic cycle following house price corrections. In addition to the
characteristics of mortgage markets already
discussed, a key feature at the current juncture
is the prevalence of mortgages with variable (as
opposed to fixed) interest rates. There are differences within Europe in this respect, where
Finland, Ireland, and Spain have mostly variable rate mortgages. Higher interest payments
(relative to household disposable income) have
also been historically associated with bigger declines in residential investment during
housing busts—see the bottom panel in the
fourth figure.10 Countries also differ in terms
of legal provisions, such as those that govern
Data

on the depth of mortgage markets—the
ratio of outstanding mortgage debt to income—are
reported in Warnock and Warnock (2007) and OECD
(2006). The mortgage market index is described in
Chapter 3 of the April 2008 World Economic Outlook.
The debt measure used here is the ratio of mortgage
debt to household disposable income for the 1990s
(from OECD, 2006), but the use of other measures
of debt—for other years or expressed as a ratio to
GDP—gives similar results. Controlling for the magnitude of the house price corrections makes the correlation between residential investment declines and
the mortgage-debt-to-GDP ratio stronger. Cardarelli
and others (forthcoming) take this analysis a step
further by using sign restrictions to identify housing
demand shocks and tracing the impact of these shocks
on house prices, residential investment, and output.
They conclude that housing finance innovation has
amplified the spillovers from housing to the rest of
the economy by strengthening the role of housing as
collateral.
10See Tsatsaronis and Zhu (2004). Warnock and
Warnock (2007) add Greece, Portugal, Sweden, and
the United Kingdom to the list of European countries with mostly variable rate mortgages; outside of
Europe, Canada, Japan, and the United States are classified as countries with mostly fixed rate mortgages.

ing defaulted residential mortgages, which can

20

influence foreclosure rates.11 In many of the
countries that are the focus of study in this
box—France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom—debtors are personally liable for the full amount of
mortgaged debt, thus reducing incentives for
foreclosure. In the United States, mortgage
foreclosure is regulated at the state level. In
six states, lenders have recourse only to the
mortgaged property, which they may repossess
and sell. In the other states, debtors are also
personally liable for the full amount of the
debt, but there are differences in the extent
to which lenders can recover the difference
between the mortgage debt and the foreclosure
sale price. In practice, lenders may choose not
to seek deficiency judgments mainly because of
the time and cost involved.
Another factor that can play a role in explaining the amplitude of the economic cycle following house price corrections is banking sector
exposure to the housing sector, which varies
across countries as well as across lending institutions within countries. The value of mortgage
loans held by banks, expressed as a multiple
of their overall market capitalization, gives
an indication of their ability to withstand the
deterioration of their real estate loan portfolios.
This indicator varies from about 4 in Denmark
and Germany, less than 3 in Spain, about 1.5 in
Canada, Japan, and the United Kingdom, and
less than 1 in the United States.12 Cross-country
declines in residential investment during housing cycles have been higher in countries with
greater banking sector exposure to mortgage
lending, but the effect has not been as strong
as that shown earlier with the mortgage-debt-to11See Klyuev (2008) and Deutsche Bank (2008)
for a discussion of the impact of foreclosure rates on
house prices.
12Estimates for countries other than the United
States are from Ahearne and others (2005) and are
based on bank-level data on mortgage loans and
market capitalization from Bloomberg L.P. and Worldscope; the U.S. estimate is based on total real estate
loans by the banking sector and total banking sector
market capitalization.

Have Macroeconomic Policies Been Too Loose?

GDP ratio. Nevertheless, at the current juncture, with bank balance sheets under renewed
stress and bank equity prices low, the potential
for an adverse impact on the real economy from
banking system exposure to mortgage lending is
perhaps greater than in the past.
Conclusions. Many advanced economies experienced a house price run-up in recent years that
is difficult to account for fully in terms of fundamental driving forces such as income growth
and interest rates. The correction in house
prices appears to have now begun in most of
these economies. If past is prologue, these cor-

rections could average about 25 percent and be
spread out over a period of two to four years.
Past evidence also suggests that cross-country
differences in the impact of these corrections
on the macroeconomy are likely to depend
on the characteristics of the housing finance
systems, particularly the ease with which households have been able to access mortgage credit
in recent years. This feature is likely to be correlated with the extent of investment declines
that occur during the house price corrections
and could also have a dampening impact on
consumption.

as examined in detail in Chapter 3, rising food
prices have been a key factor behind surging
inflation in emerging economies. By contrast, oil
price increases have played the lead role in spurring inflation in the advanced economies.
How far will these direct contributions feed
into second-round effects? Three structural
trends should mitigate such risks: (1) increasing
real wage flexibility, in contrast to the real wage
resistance seen particularly in western Europe
during the 1970s; (2) more secure anchoring of
inflation expectations by vigilant central bankers; and (3) declining energy intensity. Slowing
economic activity is also mitigating inflation risks,
particularly in the advanced economies. However,
there remain concerns in some emerging economies, particularly those where capacity constraints
are still tightening, where public wages have been
increased rapidly, and where inflexible exchange
rates may constrain the monetary response.
Rising commodity prices also have important potential effects on the terms of trade and
purchasing power and hence on growth. At
the global level, the key factor is oil, not food,
because the production of food is more evenly
distributed around the globe: on average, oil

imports are two-and-a-half times greater than
food imports.
Overall, rising oil prices have had a net dampening impact on global demand, because oil
exporters save a high proportion of additional
oil revenues, particularly since their economies
are already running into absorptive capacity
limits. The size of the redistributional effect also
depends on the source of the commodity price
shock; there is a greater effect when the price
surge reflects a pure supply shock instead of
a combination of supply and demand factors,
as seems to be the case in the current episode.
The redistributional effects are sizable, although
substantially smaller than in the 1970s, when the
intensity of oil output was about twice its current
level in advanced economies and 25 percent
higher in emerging markets (see Figure 3.9).
At the country level, low-income countries are
particularly vulnerable to strains from rising
food and fuel importation costs. Some countries
in sub-Saharan Africa have experienced termsof-trade losses of more than 5 percent of GDP
(IMF, 2008a).

Blanchard and Galí (2007) provide a careful analysis
of why the macroeconomic impact of the recent oil price
boom is likely to be smaller than in the 1970s.

The recent deterioration of performance in
the global economy comes on the heels of four

Following a period of easy monetary conditions during 2001–05, monetary policy

unchanged.

years of exceptionally strong expansion, during
which healthy gains from the increasing integration of emerging and developing economies
into the world economy contributed to the
strongest period of global growth since the early
1970s. With the benefit of hindsight, however,
it is clear that major imbalances built up across
crucial financial, housing, and commodity markets, reflecting serious flaws in the operations
of these markets and inadequate regulatory
responses, with an inevitable payback.
Some observers argue that these imbalances
in financial, housing, and commodity markets
were exacerbated by excessively loose macroeconomic policy settings during the strong
expansion over 2003–07. In particular, the
pronounced success in bringing down inflation
during the 1990s and the global productivity gains from the integration of China and
other labor-intensive economies into the world
trading system allowed for excessively easy
monetary policy in the advanced economies,
which generated a series of market bubbles.
Following the collapse of the hi-tech dot-com
bubble early this decade, monetary policy settings were kept very loose to counter deflation
concerns. Indeed, in the United States and
to a lesser extent in the euro area and Japan,
policy rates were set well below what would
be implied by the Taylor rule (Figure 1.9).
Moreover, even though monetary policy was
tightened starting in 2003, it has been suggested that the tightening did not do enough
to “lean against the wind” as credit flowed into
the housing sector and house prices rose to
levels that were far out of line with underlying
fundamentals.
In addition, inflexible exchange rate
regimes have recently limited the capacity of
some key emerging economies to carry out
independent monetary policies, a constraint
that became increasingly relevant after August
2007 as the U.S. dollar depreciated and the
Federal Reserve aggressively cut interest rates.
Thus, these economies effectively imported
an increasingly easy monetary stance from the
United States, just as inflation pressures were

Prospects for a Turnaround

rising. At the same time, the sustained surge
in commodity prices was accentuated by strong
growth in emerging economies, a weakening
U.S. dollar, lower U.S. interest rates, and—in
the view of some observers although not
IMF staff—financial flows into commodity
futures markets. Central banking orthodoxy
is to accommodate a temporary rise in inflation from a relative price shock, provided
underlying inflation remains consistent with
forward‑looking objectives. However, repeated
shocks in the same direction have increased
the risks of second-round effects from the sustained shift in relative prices.
Measures of global liquidity shown in Figure 1.9 provide only inconclusive support for
these concerns. The monetary base of the
largest advanced economies certainly grew
rapidly through 2005, and although the rate of
base expansion has moderated since then, the
emerging economies’ continued strong buildup
of international reserves implies rapid monetary growth in these economies. However, the
relationship between monetary aggregates and
prices is tenuous at best in advanced economies
and is not well understood in emerging economies. Long-term interest rates have been low
by historical standards throughout this decade,
although such rates are arguably determined
more by fundamental forces affecting the supply of and demand for savings—including the
high rates of saving in emerging economies,
increased public saving in advanced economies,
and low rates of investment globally (outside
China)—than by monetary policy settings.
Measures of the output gap provide more
direct evidence of excess demand at the global
level. To be sure, such measures are imprecise
and need to be interpreted cautiously, as highlighted in Box 1.3, which discusses the approach
used in the World Economic Outlook for assessing
potential growth and output gaps. That said,
on balance the data suggest that the global
economy has been operating well above a cycli-

cally neutral level—comparable to the late 1990s
(Figure 1.10). The advanced economies seem
to be operating at somewhat below a cyclically
neutral level—and their output gaps are likely
to widen, given that current rates of growth are
well below estimated potential. By contrast, the
emerging economies seem to have been growing
faster than trend until recently, and pressures
on capacity are still high. Even though estimates
of output gaps are particularly subject to error
for this group of countries, these assessments
are broadly consistent with the observed recent
acceleration in inflation.
Thus, while there is indeed some evidence
that monetary policy may have been too easy
at the global level and that the global economy
may have exceeded its collective speed limit,
excessive demand pressures seem to be concentrated in emerging economies and do not
appear egregious at the global level by the standards of other recent cycles. It is hard to explain
the intensity of the recent stress in financial,
housing, and commodity markets purely
through these macroeconomic factors, although
they have played some role.

Prospects for a Turnaround
Prospects for the global economy are exceptionally uncertain as this report goes to press. A
key assumption underlying the baseline projections is that comprehensive actions by the U.S.
and European governments succeed in stabilizing financial market conditions and avoiding
further systemic events. Nonetheless, markets
are likely to remain under heavy strain throughout 2008 and 2009. Even with successful implementation of the plan to remove troubled assets
from U.S. bank balance sheets, it will take time
to rebuild confidence in asset valuations and
alleviate counterparty concerns. Moreover, banks
are going to remain under pressure from the
need for more capital combined with growing

concerns are illustrated in model simulations

is worth noting, however, that estimates of potential output are frequently marked down after a cyclical
downturn.

range of 1–2 percent of GDP in 2009. In the emerging economies, output would
remain somewhat above cyclically-neutral levels, although capacity pressures
would ease some. The methodology used to estimate potential GDP growth and
output gaps is explained in Box 1.3.

credit losses coming from the broader economy.
Detailed projections laid out in the October
2008 Global Financial Stability Report (IMF, 2008b)
indicate that sustained deleveraging will reduce
credit growth to very low levels in the advanced
economies during 2009 and even beyond,
while spreads on riskier asset classes will remain
wide. Emerging and developing economies will
continue to face difficult external financing
conditions, and those with large current account
deficits or other vulnerabilities will remain
under the most pressure.
In commodity markets, in the absence of
further supply shocks or a major downgrading of growth prospects, prices are projected
to stay around current high levels, in line with
pricing in forward markets. Thus, the price of
petroleum would average about $100 a barrel in
2009. But markets are likely to remain volatile,
responding quickly to shifting perceptions of
demand and supply trends.
Against this backdrop, the baseline projections show the global economy undergoing
a major downturn, with growth falling to its
slowest pace since the 2001–02 recession. A
gradual recovery is projected to get under way
later in 2009, but global growth is not expected
to return to trend until 2010. Important supports for the eventual recovery will be the
unwinding of adverse terms-of-trade effects as
commodity prices stabilize, a turnaround in
the U.S. housing market, and rising confidence
that the liquidity and solvency problems in core
financial institutions are being resolved. On an
annual basis, global growth is expected to moderate from 5.0 percent in 2007 to 3.9 percent
in 2008 and 3.0 percent in 2009 (see Table 1.1
and Figure 1.11). These projections are well
below those provided in the July 2008 World
Economic Outlook Update, reflecting increasing
evidence in recent months of slowing activity,
the further burgeoning of the financial crisis,
and a heightened appreciation of the degree to
which financial deleveraging is likely to be an
extended constraint on growth.
The advanced economies are expected to be
particularly weak for the remainder of 2008 and

the first half of 2009. The U.S. economy faces
flat to negative growth during this period, as
support from the fiscal stimulus ebbs, export
momentum moderates, and tight financial
conditions take an increasing toll. An eventual
turnaround in the housing sector and more
stable oil prices should help lay the basis for
incipient recovery in the second half of 2009,
but the revival is expected to be much more
gradual than in previous business cycles, as tight
credit conditions continue to weigh heavily on
domestic demand. Most other advanced economies are also expected to go through a period
of extremely sluggish growth or contraction in
2008 and the first half of 2009, and to experience only a modest upturn in the latter part of
the year. In fact, all the G7 countries but Canada
are now projected to grow by less than 1 percent
on a fourth-quarter-over-fourth-quarter basis
during both 2008 and 2009.
Growth in emerging and developing economies is also projected to continue to decelerate,
falling somewhat below trend during the second
half of 2008 and early 2009 before picking up
during the course of the year. Over this period,
overall growth is projected to remain well above
rates experienced in the 2001–02 global downturn. Export growth will continue to slow and
domestic demand will also moderate, although
demand will continue to be supported by the
strong productivity gains made in recent years.
Commodity-exporting countries—particularly
oil exporters—are expected to maintain their
momentum, but growth in countries dependent
on food and fuel imports or external financing will slow quite sharply. Net external capital
inflows are projected to fall by half in the aggregate, and some countries could face substantial
pressure on reserve positions.
On the inflation front, the combination of
rising slack and stabilizing commodity prices is

By

itself, however, slow credit growth need not prevent
a recovery. Evidence from past business cycles shows that
activity typically recovers in advance of a turnaround
in the credit cycle (Claessens, Kose, and Terrones,
forthcoming).

(Real GDP; percent change from a year earlier)
The global economy is projected to slow further in the second half of 2008 and early
2009, and then to start a gradual recovery. The advanced economies will be most
affected by the downturn and will be in or close to recession. Growth will also
moderate in the emerging economies, particularly those in Asia, emerging Europe,
and Latin America with close trade links.

Chapter 1   Global Prospects and Policies

Box 1.3. Measuring Output Gaps
Rising inflation concerns have brought
increasing attention to the issue of whether
economies are overheating and how to measure an economy’s productive capacity. All else
being equal, an economy operating beyond its
capacity—with a positive gap between actual and
potential output—is likely to face rising inflation
pressures, whereas an economy well within its
capacity—with a negative output gap—will tend
to experience declining inflation. Measurements
of capacity are also important for other purposes, including assessment of the fiscal stance
over the cycle, as discussed in Chapter 5. Overall, understanding the current and future cyclical position of the economy is crucial to making
sound monetary and fiscal policy decisions.
Measuring output gaps is, however, a highly
inexact science, because productive capacity
for a whole economy is not directly observable (although some measures of capacity are
typically available for some sectors, such as
the industrial sector). Accordingly, a mix of
approaches has been used, with varying degrees
of sophistication, adjusting to data limitations.
This box reviews methods used in estimates
of output gaps in the World Economic Outlook
(WEO) projections and discusses a new modelbased approach that is now being developed.
Measurement of output gaps. For most
advanced economies, estimates of output gaps
used in the WEO are derived from an assessment of potential GDP based on a production
function approach. Under such an approach, a
production function is estimated for the economy, relating output to measured inputs of labor
and capital. The residual is a measure of total
factor productivity (TFP) in the economy, which
can then be related to explanatory variables
such as competition, structural reforms, and
import penetration. Considerable attention has
been paid in the literature to devising increas-

The main authors of this box are Charles Collyns,
Douglas Laxton, and Natalia Tamirisa, with input from
Gianni de Nicolò and assistance from Ercument Tulun.
Box 3.1 of the September 2006 World Economic
Outlook provides an example of this approach.

26

ingly careful measures of inputs—for example,
by adjusting labor inputs for the impact of education and training on the quality of labor and
by introducing a measure of the flow of capital
services—and trying to explain the TFP residual.
This approach has the advantage that once
the basic relationship is estimated, an assessment can be made of the impact of shifting factors that affect potential growth—for example,
the impact of demographics on the growth of
labor services and the impact of investment
rates on capital services.
Turning to the emerging economies, data on
labor and capital inputs are typically inadequate
for the production function approach. Moreover, the possibility of rapid change following
major reforms reduces continuity and would
make the approach more difficult to apply.
Estimates of output gaps in the economies
presented in this issue of the WEO therefore
rely on time-series techniques to estimate trend
GDP based on observed and projected GDP
series. Specifically, the output data presented
used standard Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filters,
which disentangle a time series into a trend
component and a cyclical component (Hodrick
and Prescott, 1997), using a λ coefficient of 100
on annual data.
Despite their simplicity and widespread use,
one difficulty with the HP filters (and timeseries techniques more generally) is the sensitivity of the estimates to the choice of end point.
As a rough-and-ready approximation, the HP
filter is applied to data (in log form) over the
period 1980–2008 (which can essentially be considered historical data) and again to data and
projections over the period 1980–2013. Using
the latter estimates takes advantage of the IMF
desk economists’ best judgment on mediumterm growth prospects. Potential output and
output gaps were are then derived as the average of these two estimates.
Filtering results depend heavily on the value for
the smoothing parameter λ. The value of 100 captures
the properties of the U.S. business cycle well, but it
has been less useful for other countries.

Prospects for a Turnaround

Applying this technique to 1980–2008 data
suggests a significant acceleration in potential
growth over the past decade across emerging
economies (first figure, left-hand column). The
extent of acceleration is estimated to be even
larger using data that include medium-term projections. Using either series, emerging economies
are seen as operating significantly above capacity,
especially in emerging Europe and Latin America, with the excess approaching 4 percent of
GDP in each region in 2008 using the more
conservative potential growth estimates.
Quantifying the impact of oil-price shocks on
potential output. One issue of current relevance
is how much the recent increase in oil prices,
if sustained, could affect the level and the rate
of growth potential output. Oil is a key input
for the production of many goods and services,
in part because it is used in transportation. If
the relative price of oil rises, other inputs into
production (capital and labor), which are available in limited supply and with limited substitution possibilities in the short run will need to be
used more intensively, implying a fall in productive potential. The impact of the growth rate of
potential output would depend on how quickly
output converges to its long-run level.
Using a production function approach,
Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) estimates suggest that
an increase in oil price by 240 percent from
its 20‑year average in the United States and by
170 percent above that in the euro area (to
$120 a barrel) would reduce potential output by
4 percent in the United States and 2 percent in
the euro area (OECD, 2008). The impact on

Potential Growth and Output Gaps in Emerging
Economies
Although potential growth probably rose in emerging
economies over the past decade, time-series techniques
suggest that recent growth has been above potential, implying
the opening of significant output gaps in the past year or so.
The estimated size of the gap is sensitive to the choice of end
point and to the IMF staff’s judgment of the extent to which
potential growth has risen.

provides the highest estimates for potential growth,
assuming continued strong TFP growth.

Chapter 1   Global Prospects and Policies

Box 1.3 (concluded)
U.S. potential output is higher because of
a larger share of oil in production and the
declining value of the dollar. Potential growth
is estimated to decline by 0.2 percentage point
a year in the United States and 0.1 percentage
point in the euro area in the first year of adjustment, based on the average rate at which existing capital is typically scrapped and replaced.
However, the adjustment could well occur more
rapidly in the face of a large relative price shock
because the renewal rate is likely to ­accelerate—
although energy-intensive capital tends to have
an above-average service life.
Model-based estimates of output gaps. Recent
work for the Global Projection Model (GPM)
has developed model-consistent measures
of potential output—and thus of the output
gap—that exploit information on observable
variables, such as GDP, unemployment, and
inflation. Like any macroeconomic model, the
GPM contains a system of equations, an array
of key observable variables, and a few unobservable but crucial variables, notably potential
output. Estimates for the latent variables may be
based on predictive power. Using this criterion,
of all the economically plausible paths that
potential output might take, the procedure
selects the one that best predicts the observable
variables in the model. In other words, the procedure “backs out” values of the latent variables
implied by the structure of the model and the
behavior of the observable variables.
The model contains two critical equations
in this regard. The first links inflation to the
output gap. The second is a dynamic Okun’s
law, which links unemployment gaps (actualminus-equilibrium levels) to past movements in
the output gap.
The model-based technique is less mechanical,
with much more economic content, than the HP
and other univariate filters. It offers a potentially
substantial improvement, especially in gauging
the current level of potential output in real time,
although it requires more advanced modeling
than simple filters like the HP filter.
The second figure provides some illustrative

Prospects for a Turnaround

compares the estimates of potential growth
from the GPM and from the WEO. The GPM
estimates display considerably more variation
than the WEO estimates. This is to be expected,
given that the former vary in line with the outcomes for inflation and unemployment.
The figure shows a marked discrepancy
between the two estimates in the second half
of the 1990s, a period with strongly increasing
output and declining unemployment, yet stable
inflation. The model interprets these facts to be
consistent with a more marked increase in the
growth of potential output during this period
(and hence a permanent increase in the trend
level of output) and a decline in the equilibrium (or natural) unemployment rate (middle
panel). By the end of the decade, inflation
pressure, as gauged by the output gap, or by the
deviation of unemployment from equilibrium,
was present under either estimate, but much
less under the model estimate. By the same
token, the GPM estimate of the negative output
gap in the 2001–02 recession is significantly
larger than that in the WEO estimate.
A widening discrepancy is again evident in
2008, with potential growth in GPM dropping
from 3 percent to 2 percent, whereas the WEO
measure continues on a smoother path. A major
factor at play is the sharp increase in the price of
energy, which causes productivity growth in the
GPM to drop for a while below its long-run rate.
This implies a smaller negative output gap in the
GPM for 2008, and hence less downward pressure on the core inflation rate, than in the WEO.
The third figure provides estimates of the output gap based on applying the GPM approach

expected to contain the pace of price increases
in the advanced economies and bring inflation
back below 2 percent by the end of 2009. In
emerging and developing economies, inflation
is projected to remain at about 8 percent at
end-2008 as recent commodity price increases
continue to feed through the pipeline. Inflation
is expected to ease to 6¼ percent during 2009

All in all, it is unlikely that a methodological
silver bullet for measuring potential output and
output gaps will be found anytime soon. In the
meantime, policymakers will need to continue

gaps and unemployment gaps) as well as surveybased measures of capacity utilization and highfrequency indicators, while continually testing
available estimates against reality.

relates to the risk that financial strains will be more intense and more protracted

concerns about domestic demand and global imbalances, while risks related to
inflation and the oil market are now seen as balanced.

1The fan chart shows the uncertainty around the World Economic Outlook (WEO) central

forecast with 50, 70, and 90 percent probability intervals. As shown, the 70 percent
confidence interval includes the 50 percent interval, and the 90 percent confidence interval
includes the 50 and 70 percent intervals. See Box 1.3 in the April 2006 WEO for details.

2 The chart shows the contributions of each risk factor to the overall balance of risks to global
growth, as reflected by the extent of asymmetry in the probability density for global GDP growth
shown in the fan chart. The balance of risks is tilted to the downside if the expected probability of
outcomes below the central or modal forecast (the total “downside probability”) exceeds 50
percent (Box 1.3 in the April 2006 WEO). The extent of asymmetry in the probability density in the
fan chart depends on the various sources of risk and their potential impact as well as the
standard deviation of past forecast errors—which, among other factors, varies with the length of
the forecasting horizon. To make the risk factors comparable across forecast vintages, their
contributions are rescaled to correct for differences in the standard deviations.

pal downside risk revolves around two related
financial concerns: that financial stress could
continue at very high levels and that credit
constraints from deleveraging could be deeper
and more protracted than envisaged in the
baseline. In addition, the U.S. housing market
could deteriorate for longer than envisaged,
and European housing markets could weaken
more broadly. Inflation risks to growth are now
more balanced, in light of the retreat in commodity prices and the slower trajectory of the
global economy. Global imbalances remain an
issue, but with some shift in focus away from the
potential problems of financing the U.S. current
account deficit toward risks created by the need
to recycle large surpluses from oil exporters and
toward risks of protectionism now that the Doha
Round has again stalled.

Financial Market Risks
Financial market risks remain acute, even
more of a concern than at the time of the
April 2008 World Economic Outlook. Despite
unprecedented actions by financial authorities
to prevent systemic events and a major new
initiative to help banks in the United States deal
with illiquid assets, markets remain under heavy
stress, and the threat of disorderly deleveraging
remains a serious risk to the outlook.
After the events of recent weeks, concerns
remain high about the solvency of financial
institutions in mature markets faced with rising
losses, tight funding conditions, and dwindling
capital bases. Successful implementation of the
U.S. government’s plan to purchase troubled
assets would over time reduce such risks by limiting the downside to U.S. real estate exposure
in U.S.-based institutions, but low bank capital
could remain a serious issue, especially because
asset sales could imply greater loss recognition and because weakening activity is likely to
push up losses on a broad range of assets in the
methodology used to develop the growth fan chart and
associated risk factors, and discusses work now under way
to enhance such assessments.

Prospects for a Turnaround

United States and Europe. Moreover, funding pressures are likely to remain intense until
counterparty confidence is restored.
A related concern is that the process of
deleveraging and balance-sheet repair could
be deeper and more extended than projected,
implying that credit constraints on growth could
be greater than built into the baseline. At this
point it is hard to gauge how much bank capital
levels will need to rise to be considered adequate by markets and by regulators. Indeed, the
events of recent weeks seem likely to increase
pressure on banks to accelerate deleveraging
efforts and to be extremely cautious in extending new credit as long as financial conditions
remain highly volatile. Moreover, prospects for
raising capital are highly uncertain, particularly
in light of the large losses suffered by equity
holders in recent resolutions and continuing
uncertainty over valuation. In the baseline,
credit continues to grow moderately in the
advanced economies, in line with projections
presented in the October 2008 Global Financial
Stability Report (IMF, 2008b), but credit supply
would contract under a “stress scenario” that factors in more aggressive deleveraging efforts.
Recent events have underlined the vulnerability of emerging economies to turbulence
in advanced financial markets. Intensified or
extended deleveraging in U.S. or European
banks or growing risk aversion among investors
could prompt a further scaling back of bank and
portfolio flows to emerging economies, putting
particular pressure on those economies considered vulnerable, including those with large
current account deficits, such as in emerging
Europe, or countries that have experienced rapid
credit growth based on heavy capital inflows, such
as in Russia and other countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States. Further cutbacks in
financing flows would put increasing pressure on
domestic credit conditions at a time when activity
is slowing, leading to rising stress on financial
intermediaries and borrowers.
The global repercussions of an intensification
of financial strains are illustrated in Figure 1.13,
based on simulations of a global general equilib-

rium model (BoC-GEM).10 The shock is modeled as an additional 100-basis-point widening
of credit spreads in the United States and lesser
increases elsewhere, combined with a loss of
confidence that knocks equity prices down by
a further 10 percent. As a result, U.S. domestic
demand would slow relative to baseline, lowering real GDP growth by a further 1 percentage
point over the next year, with lingering negative
effects over a three-year period. The implication
would be a considerably deeper U.S. recession
and only a gradual recovery thereafter, with
similar if less-intense effects elsewhere. Slower
global growth would tend to depress commodity
prices and raise output gaps, moderating pressure on inflation and providing greater room to
ease policy interest rates.

Risks to Domestic Demand in Advanced
Economies
Downside risks to domestic demand in
advanced economies remain clearly evident.
Related to the financial risks just discussed is the
threat of deeper and more prolonged housing
corrections than built into the forecast. The
intervention in the GSEs and the troubled-asset
purchase plan should alleviate risks in the U.S.
market to some degree by providing assurances
of the availability of housing finance and reducing risks of fire sales of distressed real estate in a
declining market. Moreover, U.S. housing valuations are moving closer in line with fundamentals; residential construction is already near a
40-year low; and inventories are falling. However, the real possibility remains that U.S. housing prices and activity will not find the projected
bottom in 2009, and instead will overshoot,
in the context of still-depressed sentiment. In
western Europe, housing market prospects are
uncertain, and dynamics could be affected by
financial deleveraging that restricts the supply of

mortgage financing. Thus, existing downturns
could intensify, and a broader range of countries
could experience house price declines, a sharp
reduction in residential investment, and greater
strains on household balance sheets.
The possibility of greater-than-projected
resilience of domestic demand in the face
of credit strains provides some upside to the
forecast. Nonfinancial corporate balance sheets
are generally sound—much improved since the
early years of this decade—and profitability is
high, although corporate bond spreads have
widened sharply in recent weeks. In the euro
area, consumption could be stronger than projected, as oil prices stabilize, particularly because
unemployment rates remain exceptionally low
and household balance sheets are stronger than
in the United States.

Risks to Domestic Demand in Emerging Economies
Risks to domestic demand in the emerging
economies are now distinctly to the downside.
The principal concerns for these economies
are external—exposure to slower global trade,
tighter external financing conditions, and
adverse terms-of-trade shocks—but domestic
demand also could be adversely affected by deteriorating conditions in financial markets and by
corrections in housing markets. Countries that
have allowed easy access to external financing
and buoyant commodity-related revenues to
drive rapid growth in domestic credit and strong
growth in government spending are at particular risk of a “sudden stop” in capital inflows that
could have a damaging impact on domestic
financial conditions and apply a sharp knock
to domestic demand. Conversely, there remains
potential for domestic demand to surprise on
the upside, for example in China, where the
government has moved quickly to introduce
measures to support growth.

Inflation Risks
Inflation risks have receded relative to the
April 2008 World Economic Outlook, as commod-

Prospects for a Turnaround

ity prices have retreated and slowing growth has
reduced pressure on capacity. In the advanced
economies, headline inflation could drop even
faster than projected, back into line with central
bank objectives, which would provide more
scope to ease monetary policy in response to
slowing activity. The concern remains, however,
that wages could accelerate in response to the
loss in purchasing power from higher food and
fuel prices if activity does not slow as projected,
particularly in western Europe, where unemployment remains low by recent standards.
Inflation risks are still manifest in a number
of emerging and developing economies, amid
signs that higher commodity prices and increasing pressure on local supply conditions are
already spilling into wage demands and inflation
expectations. The moderation in commodity
prices since July is helping to relieve some of
the upward momentum, but pressures from
this source are likely to remain for some time
because past price increases have only partially
passed through the supply chain, particularly for
oil, given that many countries have held prices
well below international levels. The concern
is that once inflation expectations become
unanchored, central banks may be forced to
tighten abruptly to generate a “hard landing”—a
period of subtrend growth—in order to bring
inflation back in line. As discussed in Chapter 3,
the output costs of regaining control over inflation could be sizable, particularly in economies
where initial policy credibility is low and the
monetary response is delayed (see Figures 3.15
and 3.16). To be sure, as emphasized in Box 1.3,
“speed limits” are hard to estimate for economies that have been able to achieve rapid rates
of growth through trade and financial integration. Although continued pools of underutilized
labor may suggest a capacity for sustained strong
growth, bottlenecks in the infrastructure and
availability of skilled labor may start to bind.

Risks from Oil Prices
Given the likely continued volatility, oil prices
are an important source of two-way risks to the

projections. Option market data suggest that
market participants are operating with an unusually wide band of uncertainty about the future
price, with outcomes from $60 a barrel to $165
a barrel falling within the 90 percent confidence
band over the period through end-2008 (see
Appendix 3.1). On the upside, oil prices could
continue to decline, providing some stabilizing
benefit to the global economy, although such
an occurrence would most likely be associated
with weakening global demand rather than a
positive supply shock, with a correspondingly
lower multiplier (see discussion in Box 1.1 of the
April 2007 World Economic Outlook). Against this,
further supply shocks could again push oil prices
up, in the context of continued limited spare
capacity, keeping pressure on consumer purchasing power, particularly in oil-importing countries,
and limiting the relief to headline inflation from
stabilizing oil prices built into the baseline.

Risks from Global Imbalances
Global imbalances remain an issue, even as
the sources of risk are shifting. In the past, the
central concern was the possibility of a disorderly unwinding of the imbalances driven by a
discontinuous shift in foreign investors’ willingness to continue financing the large U.S. current
account deficit and add to the share of U.S. assets
in their wealth portfolios. Such risks have moderated somewhat as the U.S. dollar’s depreciation
has brought it closer in line with medium-term
fundamentals and the U.S. current account
deficit has moved onto a more sustainable trajectory (Figure 1.14, top panel). Still, rising oil
prices have slowed the adjustment process as the
U.S. oil deficit has jumped, and U.S. net foreign
liabilities are still projected as a rising share
of global GDP (Figure 1.14, middle panel).11
Moreover, reduced confidence in the liquidity
11Projections are constructed assuming unchanged
exchange rates and asset prices. In fact, U.S. dollar depreciation and the relative decline of U.S. equity prices have
generated net valuation gains in recent years that have
served to offset the flow accumulation of new liabilities.
See Box 1.2 in the April 2008 World Economic Outlook.

The U.S. current account deficit has moderated in recent years and is projected to
continue to narrow over the medium term, although net foreign liabilities would
continue to build. Oil exporters’ surpluses have been boosted by rising international
oil prices, and although these surpluses are expected to come down, oil exporters are
projected to accumulate rising net foreign assets. Emerging Asia would sustain large
current account surpluses and continue to build net holdings of foreign assets.

and risk-return characteristics of U.S. assets in the
wake of the financial crisis mean that the risk of
disorderly unwinding cannot be discounted. The
recent difficulties of the GSEs—whose securities
have been purchased heavily by foreign investors, thereby providing a significant share of the
financing for the U.S. current account deficit
in recent years—are a reminder of continuing
vulnerabilities on this front.
At the same time, three other types of concern have become salient. The first is that the
adjustment of the dollar has been concentrated
in a number of flexibly managed currencies
while certain major currencies continue to be
tightly managed or pegged to the dollar. This
situation could create new imbalances over time,
for example in the euro area, whose currency is
now somewhat overvalued.
Second, the sustained rise in international
oil prices has increased the need to ensure the
stable recycling of exporters’ large surpluses.
Allowing current account surpluses to increase is
a reasonable response by oil exporters, reflecting their desire to save some of the additional
revenues. The annual aggregate surplus of oilexporting countries projected over 2008–09 has
jumped to 1½ percent of global GDP, notwithstanding the rapid increase in domestic demand
in these countries. At the same time, emerging Asia continues to run surpluses of about
1 percent of global GDP. To date, the recycling
of these funds has been relatively smooth, and
indeed investment by sovereign wealth funds
(SWFs) has played a valuable stabilizing role in
providing capital to banks during the financial
crisis. However, there is a concern that continued investment of large surpluses could lead to
protectionist resistance to rising foreign ownership. A related concern is that large investment
flows into other emerging economies, akin to
the recycling of petrodollars in the 1970s, could
contribute to excessive growth of liquidity and
increase the vulnerability of these economies.12
12See

Box 2.2 in the April 2008 World Economic Outlook
on the recycling of commodity surpluses and Box 6.1 in
this World Economic Outlook on the role of SWFs.

Policy Challenges for the Global Economy

The third concern is that continuing large
trade deficits combined with weakening employment prospects in some advanced economies
could prompt rising trade protectionism. Such
concerns are heightened by the recent deadlock in the Doha Round of multilateral trade
negotiations.

Policy Challenges for the Global
Economy
Policymakers around the world today face
the imperative of stabilizing global financial
markets, while nursing their economies through
a global downturn and tight credit and ensuring that the recent rise in inflation is reversed.
While these are the immediate priorities, work
must also progress on tackling the market and
regulatory flaws that have contributed to recent
stresses. Financial markets and institutions
must be placed on a healthier footing and supply-demand responses in commodity markets
strengthened. Continued commitment to trade
and financial integration of the global economy
remains essential to underpin longer-term
growth prospects.

Stabilizing Global Financial Markets
Policymakers face the enormous challenge of
dealing with the immediate threat to financial
stability, while also paving the way for rebuilding
a firm underpinning for financial intermediation. Achieving this daunting task will require
comprehensive solutions that address the
systemic problems—the proliferation of illiquid,
problem assets; the shortage of capital; and the
collapse of counterparty confidence—while
dealing rapidly and effectively with emerging
problems in individual institutions. Approaches
at the national level must be internationally
coordinated in order to address joint problems
and avoid creating adverse cross-border incentives. At the same time, while recognizing the
urgent need to restore stability to the system, it
is important to protect taxpayers’ interests, to
ensure that government intervention is tempo-

rary, and to avoid exacerbating moral hazard as
much as possible.
The plan by the U.S. government to purchase
troubled real estate assets from banks is a bold
initiative aimed at restoring liquidity to balance
sheets, achieving more transparent pricing of
problem assets, and reducing fears about further
losses from fire-sale liquidations. Although the
implementation details of this plan are uncertain as this report goes to press, the principal
challenge will be to balance the need for quick
and effective implementation against the
longer-term objective of containing the overall
fiscal costs, including by creating mechanisms
to ensure that the government will share in
any gains as banks return to health. It will also
be critical to ensure that bank capital is rebuilt
quickly, especially because sales of problem
assets may spur recognition of additional losses.
Public money may be needed to help sound and
viable institutions meet their capital needs.
Comprehensive solutions will be important
in western Europe too, where cross-border
issues are particularly relevant. Appropriate
policy actions would be mutually reinforcing
with those taken in the United States. Cooperative approaches within Europe should aim
at rebuilding confidence through timely bank
recapitalization, dealing with problem assets,
and protecting depositors in a consistent manner. As recent events have shown, cooperative
agreements are essential for resolution of large
cross-border institutions, requiring that weaknesses in the cross-border crisis management
framework be remedied, including through
much greater sharing of supervisory data. It
will also be important to ensure consistency of
approaches when providing temporary extensions of deposit insurance coverage.
Beyond these immediate tasks, determined
efforts will be required to address the manifold
underlying weaknesses in financial markets
revealed by the current period of financial turbulence. As laid out in the October 2008 Global
Financial Stability Report (IMF, 2008b), a central
objective is to ensure more effective and resilient risk management by individual institutions,

35

Chapter 1   Global Prospects and Policies

including by setting more robust regulatory capital requirements, insisting on stronger liquidity
management practices, and improving disclosure of risk, on and off balance sheets. Another
important task will be to strengthen approaches
to crisis resolution frameworks, including by
clarifying the roles of various official agencies,
bolstering deposit insurance systems, and ensuring adequate intervention instruments.
The emergency actions taken to deal with
the collapse of major nonbank financial intermediaries (NBFIs) over the past six months
have underlined the need for more effective
regulation and more secure capitalization of
systemically important intermediaries outside
the traditional banking system. A clear and
permanent solution will be needed for the GSEs
that addresses the long-known systemic vulnerabilities resulting from their size, the nature
of their risks, and their hybrid public-private
governance structure, while dealing with their
current shortage of capital. There is also a need
to rethink the regulatory structure for and capital adequacy of other NBFIs that play a systemic
role in securities and derivatives markets.
Emerging economies should also learn lessons
from recent strains. While less directly exposed
to the problems created by the proliferation of
structured credits, financial systems in a number of emerging economies have been seriously
disrupted by shifts in capital flows in the wake of
the financial crisis. Basic lessons concerning the
importance of strong risk management, transparency, contingency planning, and effective
crisis management are thus highly relevant to
these countries as well.
Recent events have demonstrated that greater
coordination of approaches across national
boundaries will be crucial in many of these areas,
given the growing international integration of
institutions and markets. First, differences in
national legal and regulatory frameworks open
up room for regulatory arbitrage. Although
some differences can foster healthy competition and innovation, this process has gone too
far. Second, regulatory and supervisory failures,
particularly in major financial centers, have

36

large cross-border spillover effects. And third,
cooperative approaches to resolving difficulties in the financial sector are likely to be more
effective than individual approaches because of
the interconnectedness of financial institutions
and markets. In general, policymakers have
found it challenging to stay abreast of a financial
system that, on the one hand, is globalizing but,
on the other hand, is governed by a multitude
of national legal and regulatory frameworks.
Although international bodies such as the Financial Stability Forum and the Bank for International Settlements, as well as the IMF, are playing
a crucial role in alleviating the tensions between
global and national forces, more political will
to drive collaboration forward is essential. The
latest steps in this direction, including proposals
for colleges of supervisors for the world’s largest
financial institutions, are welcome in this regard.

Nursing Economies through a Global Downturn
Macroeconomic policymakers are seeking to
find a balance between supporting activity in
the face of a global downturn and extremely
difficult financial conditions and ensuring that
the sustained shift in relative prices implied by
the surge in commodity prices does not drive
a ratcheting up of inflation, as occurred in the
1970s. The appropriate policy stance will vary
across countries. A turn to more supportive
stances is justified in some economies now
facing recession as a result of financial strains,
housing downturns, and terms-of-trade losses.
Nevertheless, policy tightening is still called for
in a number of countries that are still growing
well above their speed limits.
Turning first to the major advanced economies,
although macroeconomic policies alone can have
a limited impact as long as financial markets are
under extreme degrees of stress, steps to provide
support to economies in or near recession should
supplement efforts to stabilize financial conditions,
thus helping to break the negative feedback loops
between real and financial conditions.
• In the United States, monetary policy settings
are already highly accommodative, providing

Policy Challenges for the Global Economy

needed support to the economy in the face
of extreme financial stress and the continuing housing correction. Underlying price
pressures should be contained as economic
slack rises, providing room for further policy
easing if the downturn seems likely to deepen,
even though its effectiveness may be limited
if financial strains persist. On the fiscal front,
the stimulus package provided well-timed support to the economy, and recent initiatives to
stabilize the housing market and the financial
system are justified by the need to avert a systemic crisis. Given the potential costs of these
measures and the need for medium-term consolidation, however, adjustment measures will
be required elsewhere in the fiscal accounts as
conditions normalize, to offset the additional
spending over time.
• In the euro area, monetary conditions are
now quite tight, especially after considering
the widening in risk spreads. Rapidly slowing
activity, rising output gaps, and the recent
softening in commodity prices should contribute to lowering inflation to below 2 percent by
end-2009, providing scope to ease monetary
policy. Fiscal policy is already providing support to the euro area economy through automatic stabilizers and discretionary measures
in some countries. The limited further scope
for fiscal easing available under the revised
Stability and Growth Pact should be used to
focus public resources on stabilizing financial
conditions, as needed.
• In Japan, the monetary policy stance remains
accommodative and should remain so, given
that the economy is weakening and that
underlying price pressures are well contained,
with inflation excluding food and fuel still
close to zero. The priority for fiscal policy
continues to be medium-term consolidation,
which suggests that the currently planned fiscal package should be limited in size.
Macroeconomic policy priorities vary
considerably across emerging and developing economies. In an increasing number of
these countries, the balance of risks has now
shifted toward concerns with slowing activity as

external conditions deteriorate and headline
inflation starts to moderate. This shift would
justify a halt to the monetary policy tightening
cycle, particularly in countries where secondround effects on inflation from commodity
prices have been limited, and a turn to easing
would be called for if the outlook continues
to deteriorate. Moreover, in the face of sharp
capital outflows, countries will need to respond
quickly to ensure adequate liquidity and deal
with emerging problems in weaker institutions.
The exchange rate should be allowed to absorb
some of the pressure, but stockpiles of reserves
provide room for intervention to avoid disorderly market conditions.
However, in some other countries, notably but
not exclusively in the Middle East and Commonwealth of Independent States, inflation
pressures are still a concern in the context of
sharp increases in food prices, continued strong
growth, and tightening supply constraints.
Although the recent moderation in international commodity prices may ease some of the
pressure, the gains made over the past years
on the inflation front are already being jeopardized, and once credibility is eroded, rebuilding
it will be a costly and lengthy process. Thus,
policymakers in a number of countries may still
need to tighten policy settings further.
In most cases, monetary policy should play
the lead role in macroeconomic policy management, but it should be supported by prudent
fiscal policy and, in some cases, by flexible
exchange rate management. Inflation-targeting regimes have generally served well as a
framework that has encouraged early responses
to rising inflation pressures, while also providing scope to respond to deteriorating external
conditions. However, countries with tightly
managed exchange rate regimes have faced
greater difficulties. Efforts to tighten the monetary stance in the face of rising inflation are
undermined by capital inflows attracted by the
increase in interest rate differential, boosting
money and credit growth, and many of these
countries, particularly in emerging Asia and
the Middle East, have faced sharp increases in

37

Chapter 1   Global Prospects and Policies

inflation. In China, the authorities have used
administrative and prudential measures in
an effort to limit credit growth, but allowing
greater exchange rate flexibility would increase
the room for a more independent monetary
policy and support efforts to rebalance from
external to domestic sources of growth.
Fiscal policy should play a supportive role in
macroeconomic management. Fiscal deficits
have generally been reduced in recent years
across emerging and developing economies as
rapid growth has boosted revenues, but government spending has increased rapidly in many
countries, adding to demand pressures. Greater
restraint on spending growth, including public sector wage increases, would complement
tighter monetary policy, in the face of rising
inflation, which is particularly important in
economies with inflexible exchange regimes.
Within a given spending envelope, giving
greater priority to infrastructure spending may
help relieve supply bottlenecks, a particular concern in Middle Eastern oil-exporting countries,
which have clearly been overheating and whose
dollar pegs leave little scope for monetary tightening. Some countries with limited exchange
rate flexibility have also been more exposed to
sharply deteriorating capital inflows, and here
again fiscal tightening may be required to help
stabilize conditions.
In the face of deteriorating economic prospects, a number of emerging economies have
greater scope than in the past to use fiscal policy
as a countercyclical tool, in particular by letting
automatic stabilizers operate. However, the results
of Chapter 5 caution that fiscal stimulus packages
are unlikely to be effective—and could be counterproductive—unless confidence in medium-term
fiscal sustainability has been firmly established and
measures are timely and well targeted.

Strengthening Macroeconomic Policy
Frameworks
Beyond such immediate cyclical considerations, a more difficult global environment
has raised questions about monetary and fiscal

38

policy frameworks more broadly. Are modifications to these frameworks warranted to improve
their stabilization properties?
The inflation-targeting approach has been
challenged by the need to deal with a series of
large and one-sided commodity price shocks.
Clearly, there would be risks in focusing singlemindedly on measures of inflation excluding
food and fuel prices because such an approach
could accommodate years of high headline
inflation that could eventually spill over into
expectations and wage formation. At the same
time, however, allowing some deviation of headline inflation from inflation targets does seem
justified to help accommodate a relative price
shift without undue output volatility, although
sustained large deviations could undermine
policy credibility, as discussed in Chapter 3. This
underlines the need for clear communications
and a forward-looking approach, prepared to
tolerate temporary deviations from inflation targets, provided that expectations are sufficiently
well anchored.
Is there now a global inflation bias inherent
to the way monetary policy is set, implying a
need for more coordinated approaches to policy
setting? Policymakers tend to treat international
commodity prices as exogenously determined
and thus do not account for the impact of the
country’s demand on global commodity markets, exacerbating the global supply constraint.
However, the size of the externality seems likely
to be of second-order magnitude even for major
oil consumers, and it is not clear how such an
externality could be effectively internalized.
Practically, it seems sensible for monetary policymakers to continue to focus on minimizing
volatility in domestic inflation and output while
relying on more direct action to relieve commodity market pressures, as discussed below. If
they do so successfully, they will also contribute to minimizing volatility in global markets,
including those for commodities.
A second concern is that countries that manage their currencies tightly against another
country’s currency find themselves importing
the other country’s monetary conditions, which

Policy Challenges for the Global Economy

may not be appropriate to their circumstances.
The tension is particularly great where countries
face large shocks of opposite sign. Thus, the
United States has been easing at a time when
many countries with dollar pegs are running
current account surpluses and operating at or
beyond capacity. These latter countries would
benefit from tighter monetary conditions and
exchange rate appreciation. However, absent a
formal currency union arrangement, it is not
reasonable to expect the central bank with the
reserve currency to adjust its policy to reflect
monetary conditions in other countries that
choose to peg against that reserve currency.
Moreover, such tightening would be likely to
contribute to dollar appreciation and thus not
be helpful in terms of the desired rebalancing
of current accounts. Although there are many
considerations that feed into the choice of an
exchange rate regime, there would be stabilization benefits for countries with adequately developed financial institutions to move over time
to more flexible rate regimes that provide for
greater control over domestic monetary conditions. This issue is explored further in Box 3.3.
Recent events in housing and financial markets have again brought attention to the extent
to which monetary policy should respond to
asset price movements. Inflation-targeting central banks do take asset price movements into
account to the extent that they have an impact
on short-term output and price prospects and
risks. There is a concern, however, that this may
lead to asymmetrical responses, because sharp
declines in asset prices may lead to quick policy
easing, whereas a longer period of asset price
buildup may not generate much resistance,
provided near-term prospects remain fair. This
has led to proposals for leaning against the wind
of asset price movements, especially when these
are rapid or seem to be moving prices seriously
out of line with fundamentals (Chapter 3 of
the April 2008 World Economic Outlook and BIS,
2008). The usual counterarguments are that
such a policy would be hard to calibrate and
that it is not clear how successful monetary
policy by itself can be in dampening asset price

cycles. However, recent research has emphasized
that short-term interest-rate settings have played
an increasingly important role in the monetary
transmission mechanism as the shift toward market-based financing has increased the procyclicality of leverage (Adrian and Shin, 2008).
A complementary approach would be to
introduce a systemwide element to the regulatory framework to weigh against the inherent
procyclicality of credit creation. Such a “macroprudential” approach could involve increasing
regulatory attention to the way financial incentives and constraints affect risk-taking behavior
throughout the credit cycle (Bernanke, 2008).
Moreover, capital and provisioning requirements
could be tightened during the upswing of the
economic cycle to reduce the risk of destabilizing
credit booms and could be aligned with reforms
to strengthen risk management within individual
institutions. Such reforms would need to be
developed in the broader context of an overhaul
of regulatory approaches discussed further below.
Increasing attention is also being paid to fiscal
policy frameworks. As discussed in Chapter 5,
fiscal policy can play a useful countercyclical
role, provided its support is timely, does not
undermine medium-term sustainability, and is
well structured to maximize impact. Automatic
stabilizers provide support that generally satisfies at least the first two of these criteria, and
reforms could be considered, for example to
safety net programs, that would increase their
countercyclical impact without distorting the
basic purpose of government tax or spending
policies. Discretionary policy can also play a
countercyclical role, but timeliness and, especially, reversibility can be more problematic. A
“deficit bias” can contribute to undermining
policy credibility and therefore effectiveness,
as shown in Chapter 5, by the limited impact
of fiscal stimulus in high-debt countries. To
remedy this, a rules-based countercyclical policy
response could be considered, supported by
stronger fiscal governance mechanisms to give
greater emphasis to ensuring consistency with
long-term fiscal sustainability. Such an approach
could reinforce the overall stabilization proper-

39

Chapter 1   Global Prospects and Policies

ties of macroeconomic policies and reduce some
of the burden on monetary policy.

Strengthening Supply and Demand Responses in
Commodity Markets
The recent decline in commodity prices in
the face of a global slowdown should not be
allowed to undercut policy efforts to relieve
strains in commodity markets. The focus should
be on policies to improve supply and demand
responsiveness, while avoiding measures that
could exacerbate market tightness in the short
term. It will be important to pass through
changes in international prices to domestic
markets, while developing well‑targeted safety
nets to cushion the impact on low-income
groups. Policies that discourage exports in
favor of domestic markets should continue to
be rolled back. Advanced economies generally
allow commodity price changes to feed through
but should take steps to moderate their use of
energy and food—far higher per capita than in
the emerging and developing economies—by
encouraging greater energy conservation (for
example, through fuel-efficiency standards as
well as price-based measures) and reducing
biofuel subsidies.
Priority should also be given to policies that
strengthen the supply response to higher prices.
Agricultural production in emerging markets
could be fostered by steps to build up the infrastructure for irrigation and transportation and
to ensure more effective transfer of new technologies to improve yields in developing economies
so they are more in line with those in advanced
economies. In energy markets, improved provision of information about resources, inventories, and investment plans, and clear and
stable investment frameworks, would provide a
better basis for the needed long-term buildup of
investment in this sector. Finally, liberalization
of access for agricultural products to advanced
economy markets, through a successful conclusion of the Doha Round, would play an important part in establishing a stronger long-term
framework for agricultural development.
40

Managing Global Imbalances
As emphasized above, the issue of global
imbalances has multiple dimensions. Some progress has been made toward unwinding the large
U.S. current account deficit, and more adjustment is in train, even though rising oil prices
have slowed the process and financial vulnerabilities have added to concerns. The multilateral
strategy endorsed by the International Monetary
and Financial Committee in 2005 and elaborated by the Multilateral Consultation on Global
Imbalances in 2006–07 remains broadly relevant,
but needs to be applied flexibly (Box 1.3 in the
April 2008 World Economic Outlook provides a
comprehensive overview of progress since the
Multilateral Consultation). U.S. fiscal consolidation remains a key medium-term objective, but
recent countercyclical fiscal stimulus and public
support for the housing and financial sectors
have been justified to alleviate the current slowdown and to stabilize markets. Progress needs to
continue toward appreciation of the renminbi
as part of China’s broader strategy to shift the
sources of growth toward internal demand
and to increase the effectiveness of monetary
policy. Middle Eastern oil exporters will need
to adjust plans to build up spending out of oil
revenues in order to reduce overheating in their
economies, including less-ambitious spending
increases and a tighter focus on relieving supply
bottlenecks. For their part, the euro area and
Japan should press ahead with product and
labor market reforms to raise potential growth
in their economies.
Even with implementation of such a strategy,
global current account imbalances are likely to
be sustained at high levels for a considerable
period, particularly given the impact of rising oil
prices and increasingly binding capacity constraints on oil exporters’ current account surpluses. It will be important to ensure that such
imbalances do not undermine continued commitment to open trade and capital flows, which
has underpinned global growth over the past
decades. One challenge is to ensure the investment of these resources in a secure fashion that

Appendix 1.1. Assessing and Communicating Risks to the Global OutlooK

does not lead to the buildup of vulnerabilities in
capital-importing countries. Recently, a number
of emerging economies—notably in emerging Europe but elsewhere too—have had large
current account deficits for sustained periods
that stand out by historical standards on both
dimensions. As discussed in Chapter 6, to some
degree this experience can be understood in
terms of the opportunities created by financial
development, capital account liberalization, and
European integration. However, the experience
of the Latin American debt crisis in the early
1980s after years of strong oil-related inflows
provides a salutary lesson that such episodes
can end with a painful bump. Countries receiving capital inflows must therefore be careful to
ensure that the flows do not lead to a buildup
of vulnerabilities or balance-sheet mismatches,
including by strengthening financial supervision
and domestic financial institutions and ensuring
an overall macroeconomic context conducive to
sustainable growth.
Finally, it will be important to ensure that
large imbalances in trade flows do not lead to a
buildup in protectionist measures on either the
current or capital account. Breaking the current deadlock on the Doha Round would help
strengthen the open multilateral trading system.
On the capital account side, the growing role of
SWFs as an investment vehicle is an important
development. The set of principles and practices
recently agreed by SWFs (the Santiago Principles) to guide their governance, investment,
and risk management will help make such flows
more transparent and thus should help reduce
concerns about governance of such funds that
could lead to counterproductive restrictions on
such inflows (see Box 6.1).13 Moreover, the new
guidelines that are under development at the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development for recipient countries will help
reassure SWFs of fair, transparent, and open
access to markets.

Wealth Funds (forthcoming, October 2008).

Appendix 1.1. Assessing and
Communicating Risks to the
Global Outlook
The main authors of this appendix are Kevin Clinton,
Thomas Helbling, Douglas Laxton, and Natalia
Tamirisa, with assistance from Juigang Chen, Ioan
Carabenciov, and Ondra Kamenik.
Like all forecasts, the World Economic Outlook (WEO) central, or baseline, projections
are subject to considerable uncertainty. This
appenddix discusses approaches that have been
used in the WEO to assess and communicate
risks to the WEO forecasts and reports on ongoing work to strengthen macroeconomic risk
analysis.
As background, it is important to understand
how the global projections are prepared by IMF
staff. The process underlying the preparation
of the WEO forecast is not based on a single
formal model. It is driven by the judgment of
specialists who prepare individual country projections combined, through a multistage interactive process based on a consistent set of basic
assumptions, with assessments from the teams
covering global economic and financial developments. This process is supported by a suite
of country-specific, regional, and multicountry
macroeconomic models. It also draws on discussions with country authorities in the course
of bilateral surveillance as well as with market
participants and academics during multilateral
surveillance missions.

The Fan Chart
In recent years, following the recommendations of Timmermann (2006), the IMF staff has
presented risks to the WEO projections using
a fan chart (see, for example, Figure 1.12).
The chart shows the estimated confidence
intervals around the baseline world growth
forecast, which widen as the forecast horizon
stretches into the future. The methodology for
constructing the fan chart is similar to that
originally developed by the Bank of England

1Forecast errors are defined as the difference between actual world growth and the WEO
forecast of world growth. The errors are calculated for the current-year and following-year
forecasts in the April and October issues of the WEO for the period 1991–2007. A negative
(positive) forecast error indicates that the actual value is below (above) the forecast, that is,
the forecast is biased upward (downward).

(see Britton, Fisher, and Whitley, 1998). Outcomes for world growth are assumed to follow
a “two-piece-­normal” distribution. The central
forecast is represented as the mode, or the
most likely ­outcome, and the width of the fan is
determined by the distribution of past forecast
errors. The skewness of the distribution, or the
relative size of the two pieces of the normal
distribution, represents the balance of risks to
the central forecast.
The preparation of the fan chart incorporates
an array of empirical judgments about the most
likely sources of risk and about the way they
may affect macroeconomic developments. The
contributions of each risk factor to the overall
balance of risks to global growth are shown in
the risk factor chart, which complements the
fan chart. The impact of individual risk factors
is quantified using the IMF’s suite of macro­
economic models and the IMF staff’s judgment.
The assessed risks are usually not symmetric—
but weighted more to one side. The sum of the
risk factors provides a measure of the balance
of risks, or the skew of the probability distribution around the mode, defined as the distance
between the mean (the average outcome) and
the mode (the most likely outcome). When the
risks are symmetric, the average of all possibilities is the most likely outcome. However, when
the risks are unbalanced, for example to the
downside, the left-hand tail of the distribution
is longer, the mean forecast is below the mode,
and the skew is negative. The median (or the
point that splits the forecast distribution in half,
with 50 percent probability on either side) falls
between the mode and the mean.
Skewed distributions reflect the IMF staff’s
views on the risks to the forecasts. The staff
might see a higher risk of deviation from the
forecast in one direction than the other for
a number of reasons. First, asymmetric risk
assessment may result from an acknowledgment of nonlinearities in the global economy.
For example, capacity constraints in the goods
market and labor market would limit the room
for upside potential when the economy is
operating close to full capacity. The zero bound

on nominal interest rates, financial accelerator
mechanisms that amplify shocks throughout the
system, and herd behavior in financial markets
could all generate complex and asymmetric
feedback effects.
The second reason for asymmetries is to
reflect incoming new information, after the forecast is “frozen.” For example, oil prices could
move substantially out of line with the assumed
path, or there could be rapid financial developments whose impact is hard to assess but that
clearly could have a significant and asymmetric
impact, as was the case last year.
The third reason for asymmetry stems from
possible internal inconsistency of the WEO forecasts.
These are not based on an internally consistent
macroeconomic model and assume interest rates
and oil prices broadly consistent with market
expectations and constant real exchange rates,
which may be at odds with the IMF staff’s assessment of the outlook.
The fourth reason relates to the possibility
of a systematic behavioral bias in the WEO baseline
forecasts. An analysis of past forecast errors suggests that during 1991–2007 the World Economic
Outlook had a general tendency to underpredict
world growth somewhat while overpredicting it
substantially in the years immediately preceding global recessions—defined as annual world
growth (based on purchasing-power-parity
weights) falling below 3 percent (see Figures
1.15 and 1.16). This may reflect the well-known
difficulty of predicting “tail events” (defined as
adverse outcomes that have up to a 10 percent
probability of occurring), for example, systemic
financial events or hard-landing outcomes.
Even though the fan chart provides a useful illustrative device for communicating risks
underlying the WEO baseline forecasts, and the
heuristic approach underlying its construction is
sufficiently flexible to incorporate a wide range
of complex considerations, the methodology has
some drawbacks. The sources of uncertainty are
somewhat ad hoc, because they are not derived
from a formal model of the economy, and the
actual distribution of likelihood of different
outcomes may not be normal. In addition, the

1Forecast errors are defined as the difference between actual world growth and the WEO
forecast of world growth. The errors are calculated for the current-year and following-year
forecasts in the April and October issues of the WEO for the period 1991–2007. A negative

standard deviation of the distribution used to
construct the fan chart is fixed and does not
vary with the state of the world. The risk factors
used to determine the extent of asymmetry in
the distribution are typically ad hoc and, in reality, jointly distributed rather than independent.
Thus, inflation risks are greater in the presence
of an oil price spike, whereas risks to domestic
demand depend on the evolution of financial
conditions. As discussed above, a fan chart based
on a two-piece-normal distribution may underestimate the risks of tail events such as global
recessions.

One way to complement the fan chart
approach is to gauge the risk of a global recession using a leading indicator approach.
Leading indicators are variables that help
predict the probability of global downturns
(recessions) some three to nine months
ahead.14 A suitable indicator has a turning
point that precedes a change in global activity
in a systematic and consistent manner. Leading indicators have long been used in business
cycle analysis (for example, Zarnowitz, 1992),
although finding reliable indicators remains
surprisingly difficult.15
IMF staff analysis suggests that an index
constructed as a combination of U.S. financial
and real variables and cyclical commodity prices
has promising leading indicator properties. The
financial variables include the slope of the term
structure (proxied by the spread between 10year and three-month Treasury rates) and stock
returns (S&P 500). The other variables are U.S.
industrial production and the IMF’s metals price
index. Based on September 2008 data, this indicator points to a probability of global recession
within the next three months of approaching
60 percent, up from almost 50 percent late last

14The dating of the cycle in global activity is based on a
monthly series of global industrial production.
15Another difficulty is the lack of sufficiently long time
series for many relevant high-frequency indicators.

44

year.16 As Figure 1.17 shows, together these variables have predicted past global recessions with
a probability of more than 50 percent without
providing false signals during 1980–2007.17
This approach should also be used cautiously.
The strength and timing of the signal varied
across recessions, which is consistent with the
general experience with leading indicators
(for example, Stock and Watson, 1989, 2003).
Moreover, the leading indicator approach is
essentially statistical and does not provide much
insight into the processes generating adverse
outcomes or how they might change over time.
Thus, a leading indicator approach at the global
level, although simple and intuitive, is not a
panacea when it comes to assessing risks to
global growth.

Scenario Analysis
An alternative way to address the above
issues is to complement the judgment-based
risk assessment, as embodied in fan charts, with
analyses using a fully articulated model to assess
the impact of shocks to key variables. Thus,
Figure 1.15 in the April 2008 World Economic
Outlook illustrated the impact of a deeper financial sector shock, and Box 1.1 in the April 2007
World Economic Outlook illustrated the effects of
oil-price shocks stemming, respectively, from
demand and supply factors. Model simulations
are particularly useful for tracing the complex
dynamic interactions that occur when a shock
moves the economy away from its previously
expected path. However the simulated scenarios,
in themselves, do not provide a guide to the
distribution of risks. This requires inclusion
within the model of a probabilistic framework
that contains estimates of the distributions of
relevant shocks.

16For

comparison, the fan chart now suggests that the
risk of global recession is almost 20 percent.
17A false signal would be a prediction of more than
50 percent probability of a global recession at a time the
global economy was expanding.

Macroeconomic Model-Based
Confidence Intervals
Work is now under way at the IMF on an
estimated multicountry model capable of producing baseline forecasts and fan charts, with
all numerical assumptions—including distribution of shocks—clearly spelled out.18 This new
Global Projection Model (GPM) builds on the
significant progress that has been made, at
various central banks, in estimating a complete
system of equations that link demand and supply shocks in different markets to macroeconomic variables.19 Such a model is not capable
of producing forecasts with the full country
detail provided by the WEO forecasts, but has
the advantage of greater consistency and clarity
between assumptions and outcomes. It can also
be used to produce conditional forecasts to
indicate the impact of shocks on one or more
variables.
Almost all this research has so far been based
on symmetric shock distributions and linear
models, which will result in symmetric confidence bands, but the IMF staff has been working to introduce three sources of asymmetry:
(1) the zero-interest-rate floor; (2) a nonlinear
output-inflation process, in which positive
shocks to aggregate demand have larger inflation ­implications when the economy is already
­overheating than when there is significant slack
in the economy; and (3) a credit-tightness
effect on the real economy, whereby an easing
of financial conditions may not increase lending much beyond a certain threshold (once
there is sufficient collateral to satisfy lenders of
18See

Carabenciov and others (forthcoming) for a
description of a preliminary three-region version of the
GPM that includes models for the United States, the euro
area, and Japan. In the near term, the GPM will be used
to run scenarios and check the macro consistency in the
IMF desk economists’ baseline forecasts much as the
Federal Reserve Board of Governors uses macro models
to check the consistency of their own forecasts.
19This has been made possible by the development of
user-friendly Bayesian-estimation routines, which are now
being used extensively in policymaking institutions and
academia to estimate macro models—see Laxton, Rose,
and Scott (forthcoming).

the safety of their loans, a further increase in
the value of the collateral may not affect their
behavior very much).
Figure 1.18 provides some illustrative confidence intervals from this extended version of
the GPM.20 The central path lines within the
fans represent the baseline solutions of the
model for the expected path of the economy.
Unlike conventional forecasts, this is an unconditional forecast, which assumes that all shocks
are set to zero, with none of the ­judgmentbased input that usually proves to be very useful
when producing near-term forecasts.21 The
boundaries of the fans represent 90 percent
confidence intervals, which are derived from
estimated historical distributions of shocks.
The wider confidence intervals depicted in the
fourth panel are based on building into the
GPM an assumption that shocks to credit conditions become larger when credit conditions are
exceptionally tight. The wider bands suggest
that the increased uncertainty would all be on
the downside for the output gap, inflation, and
short-term interest rates.

Country and Regional Perspectives

Against the background of the global outlook outlined
in Chapter 1, this chapter discusses how the main
countries and regions that make up the world economy
are coping with intense financial strains, high commodity prices, and the global downturn. It then draws
policy lessons, with a view to finding an appropriate
balance between responding to deteriorating short-term
growth prospects, containing inflation, and fostering
longer-term growth potential.

United States and Canada: Prognosis for
the Downturn
The United States has been at the center of the
intensifying global financial storm discussed in
Chapter 1, and the economy is now slowing fast.
The latest data suggest that GDP rose 2.8 percent
at an annualized rate in the second quarter as
surging net exports and tax rebate checks buoyed
consumption and outweighed the drag from
financial turmoil, a continuing housing correction, and high commodity prices. However, taking
the most recent three quarters together, the
pace of growth averaged only 1¼ percent, well
below potential. More important, available data
for the third quarter suggest a further slowdown
and forward-looking indicators—such as consumer and business confidence and accumulating evidence of the negative impact on credit of
recent financial market disruptions—suggest that
the economy is likely to contract in the current
quarter and into early 2009.
Since the summer of 2007, declining residential investment has been a major drag on output
(subtracting about ¾ percentage point off
growth), inventories have been compressed, and
consumption has slowed. By contrast, there have
been two sources of resilience. First, net exports
have continued to boom—adding 1½ percentFurther analysis of regional and country developments
is provided in the IMF Regional Economic Outlooks.

age points to growth over the period—although
surging oil prices kept the current account deficit at about 5 percent of GDP. Second, despite
the slowing economy and tighter credit conditions, U.S. firms have remained healthy, benefiting from relatively low leverage, high profits,
and strong export demand, which explain why
cuts in business spending and employment were
moderate until recently.
With a recession now looking increasingly
likely, the key questions are, how deep will the
downturn be, when will a recovery get under
way, and how strong will it be? The key determinants of the short-term outlook will be the
effectiveness of recent government initiatives to
stabilize financial market conditions, as well as
the behavior of U.S. households in the face of
rising stress, the depth of the housing cycle, and
the extent to which inflation concerns constrain
monetary policy.
Faced by a rapidly expanding and increasingly
dangerous financial crisis, the authorities have
acted to deal with immediate threats to systemic
stability and have passed a major initiative to
purchase illiquid assets from banks—although
it will take time to organize these operations.
Once fully in place, these measures should
help to stabilize market conditions, but even
so the process of balance-sheet repair will be
long and arduous. It will take considerable time
before losses are fully recognized, banks are
recapitalized, leverage is reduced, and market
confidence is regained. Tight bank lending
conditions are now having a visible impact on
the growth of new loans, and credit availability
is likely to remain tight throughout 2009. The
impact is likely to be greatest on households,
given their deteriorating balance sheets, but
under current dislocated financial market
conditions, firms are also likely to be affected
adversely, notwithstanding stronger balance
sheets and still-healthy profit margins.

U.S. households are coming under increasing strain. So far they have maintained
moderate spending growth, but current drags on growth include falling employment,
tightening credit, and declining net worth, as well as rising fuel and food prices.
However, housing affordability has improved and there are signs that housing
valuations are moving closer in line with historical trends.

While consumption has continued to increase
in recent quarters, U.S. households face rising
cash-flow and balance-sheet strains. Income
growth has slowed as employment has dropped
since January, the average workweek has shrunk,
unemployment has risen by a full percentage
point, wages have stagnated, and gas prices
remain high (Figure 2.1). Falling house prices
and the weakening equity market have contributed to a 10 percent drop in household
net wealth relative to GDP. Moreover, access to
credit has tightened markedly, most notably for
mortgages but also for other sources of consumer finance.
A key element of the baseline forecast is that
consumption will now show more obvious signs
of weakness. In the projections, consumption
declines in the second half of 2008, as the stimulus from the the tax rebate checks wears off, and
in the early part of 2009. It would then recover
gradually during the remainder of the year, held
back by cash-flow strains and the need to rebuild
savings.
Strains on households are in part a reflection of the massive continuing downturn in the
housing market. The drop in house prices—in
the range of 5 to 17 percent over the past year,
depending on the index used—is unprecedented since the Great Depression. As a result,
more than 10 million households owe more on
their mortgages than the market value of their
homes. Housing-related activity has also plummeted—housing starts have fallen 60 percent
from their peak. This was a needed correction
after a period of excess, and there are now some
tentative signs of stabilization, for example in
recent home sales data, although up to onethird of sales now involve foreclosure, an indicator of weakness rather than strength.
The baseline projections anticipate that the
housing cycle will eventually find a floor in 2009
after four years of correction. The projections
build in a further 10 percent decline in house
prices by the end of the year, in line with market
expectations (although these forward markets
are very thin), which will bring prices closer in
line with fundamentals. Moreover, residential

Western Europe: Struggling with Multiple Shocks

investment relative to GDP is around a 40-year
low, and the drop in housing starts is bringing
down inventories of unsold new homes. Support
should also be provided by recent legislation
to facilitate the refinancing of “underwater”
mortgages with federal guarantees and to provide assurances that Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac—the government-sponsored enterprises
(GSEs) that are behind about 80 percent of
new mortgage lending in recent quarters—will
continue to provide housing finance.
On the inflation front, still-high energy prices
boosted headline personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation to 4.6 percent (12-month
rate) in August 2008, while core PCE inflation ticked up to 2.6 percent. Given the recent
retreat in international oil prices, headline
figures are likely to start coming down, and the
widening output gap, moderate wage increases,
and a pickup in productivity should all help
contain underlying inflation.
Putting together the pieces of the puzzle,
activity is projected to decline in the final
quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009,
stabilize in the second quarter, and then embark
on a gradual recovery. On a year-over-year basis,
growth moderates from 2.0 percent in 2007 to
1.6 percent in 2008 and 0.1 percent in 2009
(Table 2.1). The economy only returns to potential growth in 2010. Risks around this forecast
are to the downside. Particular concerns are that
the credit crunch could impose an ever-greater
constraint on activity, that the house price
correction could extend into 2010, and that
inflation pressures may prove more persistent,
limiting the Federal Reserve’s room for maneuver. The principal upside potential is that U.S.
firms may be able to maintain their spending
patterns better than expected, despite financial
strains, which would provide greater-than-anticipated support for household incomes.
While the immediate task is to stabilize
financial conditions, policymakers must ensure
appropriately supportive macroeconomic policy
settings, including efforts to contain negative
macrofinancial feedback loops. The present
highly accommodative monetary policy stance

could be eased still further if the downturn
seems likely to deepen, even though its effectiveness may be limited if financial strains
persist, and the Federal Reserve will continue to
be watchful on the inflation front. Eventually,
policy will need to move toward a more neutral
stance as an economic recovery gathers steam
and financial conditions improve. On the fiscal
front, the stimulus package provided well-timed
support, but the fiscal deficit is rising sharply
and is now projected at 4½ percent of GDP in
2009, the highest among the G7 countries, without allowing for the potentially sizable impact
of recent measures to stabilize the financial and
housing sectors. The need for fiscal consolidation in the face of medium-term spending
pressures and long-term challenges posed by
demographics and rising medical costs point
to the need for adjustment measures elsewhere
once the situation has stabilized in order to
offset the costs of financial system support.
In Canada, economic activity has slowed
sharply since mid-2007, and growth is projected
to come down from 2.7 percent in 2007 to
0.7 percent in 2008 before picking up to 1.2 percent in 2009. Although the resource-intensive
sectors have benefited from high commodity
prices, the lagged effect of past real appreciation of the Canadian dollar, together with the
U.S. slowdown, has hit manufacturing hard.
The Bank of Canada eased interest rates by
150 basis points between December 2007 and
April 2008 and has held rates steady since then.
Despite its recent acceleration to 3½ percent,
inflation has generally remained well anchored,
in part owing to the rising currency. Banks have
generally weathered the financial strains well
so far, reflecting conservative regulation and
low exposure to structured products, but risks
remain given the strong economic and financial
linkages with the United States.

extraordinary financial stress. Real GDP growth
has stalled in the euro, following a first-quarter
rebound. Growth was already noticeably weaker
elsewhere during the first quarter, including in
the United Kingdom and most Nordic countries,
and conjunctural indicators now suggest that
many countries are moving close to or into recession. At the same time, high oil and food prices
are still keeping inflation at elevated levels.
Economic growth is being slowed by a number of factors, initially mainly by rising oil prices

conditions. Relative to 2007, oil prices are some
40 percent higher in euro terms and, together
with surging food prices, have squeezed alreadysluggish consumption growth. All other things
equal, standard rules of thumb would imply
output losses from such a shock in a broad
range up to about @/3 percent of GDP for the

price index (CPI) food price inflation in
the euro area increased from about 2 percent in mid2007 to 6.2 percent in August 2008, contributing 0.8 percentage point to the 3.8 percent August headline CPI
inflation rate. Energy contributed 1.1 percentage points.
Higher food prices mainly redistribute income within
western Europe and thus have much smaller direct effects
on economic growth than high oil prices (see Chapter 3).

Figure 2.2. Western Europe: Slowing Demand and
High Inflation1
Although headline inflation is high, wages have generally remained subdued, and
slowing activity and rising unemployment fears should restrain demand for pay
hikes. In the euro area, monetary conditions are on the tight side by the standards of
recent history, and countries have little room for discretionary fiscal stimulus, lest
they breach the Maastricht limit of 3 percent of GDP deficit.

euro area—less for oil producers such as the
United Kingdom and Norway. Although oil
prices increased sevenfold over 1999–2008, the
response of wages has remained generally subdued, unlike during the 1970s, reflecting structural reforms and improved policy frameworks.
Together with rapidly cooling activity and rising
unemployment fears, these factors should help
contain wages over the coming year (Figure 2.2).
Thus, while headline inflation has recently
been running in the 3–4 percent range in many
countries, core inflation (excluding all food
and energy) has generally been below 2 percent
in the euro area and the United Kingdom.
Inflation expectations have generally remained
well anchored, although somewhat less so in the
United Kingdom than in the euro area.
While oil and food price hikes are undercutting real disposable incomes, financial conditions are tightening quickly. European banks are
struggling with a confluence of adverse shocks.
They have been exposed to losses on their
holdings of U.S.-mortgage-related assets and
deteriorating overall credit quality since 2007.
Concerns that initially focused on liquidity are
also affecting solvency. Confidence in the sector
has weakened and highly leveraged banks are
struggling to maintain funding in the face of rising creditor concerns about balance-sheet risk.
Equity-to-asset ratios will need to be boosted,
which, to a large extent, will have to be achieved
by cutting back on lending because bank stock
prices have declined. The process of deleveraging, including market exit by some institutions,
will likely be long and arduous and banks have
already tightened lending standards to far above
pre-turmoil levels.

particularly in countries such as Ireland, Spain,
and the United Kingdom, where floating-rate
mortages indexed to short-term interest rates
are common. In real terms, residential property prices are falling in these and some other
countries, while slowing quickly elsewhere (see
Box 1.2). While there is a risk of an outright
housing-related credit crunch, some factors
would mitigate pernicious feedback loops
between the financial and real sectors (Chapter 4). Although residential real estate generally accounts for a larger share of activity in
western Europe than the United States, the
recent expansion of residential investment was
generally less pronounced, except in Finland,
Greece, Ireland, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Furthermore, these countries are less
likely to suffer from the financial vulnerabilities
exposed in the United States: household savings
are generally higher and debt lower, non-prime
lending is much less widespread, loan-to-value
ratios are more conservative, and opportunities
for equity withdrawal are much more limited.
However, even in the absence of an outright
credit crunch, the downturn in residential real
estate will have an appreciable short-run impact
in some countries (for example, Ireland, Spain,
and the United Kingdom) and, with the exception of a few countries (for example, Austria,
Germany, and Switzerland), produce noticeable
medium‑term headwinds.
Turning to nonfinancial firms, balance sheets
are stronger than at the onset of the 2001–02
cyclical downturn, and this should limit the
effect of financial sector strains on investment.
On the other hand, the longer the financial
stresses last, the more corporate profits, balance
sheets, and investment will suffer.
The euro area’s external current account was
close to balance in 2007 (Table 2.2). Exports
are expected to slow in line with world demand,
however, and the current account is expected to
deteriorate, mainly on account of worsened terms
of trade. Also, the real effective exchange rate is
on the strong side of medium-term fundamentals,
despite some recent weakening. By contrast, the
United Kingdom’s current account is in notice-

able deficit, and the pound sterling has depreciated by more than 10 percent in real effective
terms since the onset of the market turmoil.
In this challenging environment, central
banks have tried to ease liquidity pressures,
including through provision of U.S. dollar
liquidity, and a number of governments (for
example, Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and the United
Kingdom) have stepped in to provide solvency
support for resolutions of a number of major

financial institutions (including Dexia and
Fortis) or by raising deposit guarantee limits and
extending guarantees to creditors (for example,
Ireland), or by providing explicit assurances
to depositors (for example, Germany and the
United Kingdom). However, even if a comprehensive approach to address the growing concerns is put in place rapidly, it will take time to
return perceptions of counterparty risk to more
normal levels. Accordingly, banks’ deleveraging
will weigh noticeably on economic growth over
the coming quarters.
The baseline projections thus envisage a
significant slowdown in activity across western
Europe followed by a very gradual recovery
beginning in the second half of 2009. Euro area
growth is expected to moderate from 2.6 percent in 2007 to 1.3 percent and 0.2 percent,
respectively, in 2008–09, before returning to
1.4 percent in 2010. In the United Kingdom, real
GDP growth would fall from 3.0 percent in 2007
to 1.0 percent in 2008; activity would contract
by 0.1 percent in 2009 and then accelerate to
2.2 percent in 2010. The risks around these
growth projections are to the downside. They
include accelerated deleveraging in the financial
sector set off by broader asset price deflation and
a global credit crunch, an abrupt unwinding of
global imbalances, and sharp appreciation of the
euro. On the upside, risks relate to still-buoyant
employment and therefore higher-than-projected
consumption, but these are small. Volatile energy
and food prices are a source of two-way risk.
The fiscal positions of western European
countries differ widely, but many have made significant progress toward consolidation since the
previous downturn. Even with some widening
in 2008–09 related to both cyclical factors and
policy support, the general government deficit for euro area countries would still average
about 1¾ percent of GDP, 1¼ percentage points
less than in 2003–04. However, fiscal deficits of
some countries (France, Greece, Ireland, Italy,
and Portugal) are still far from their mediumterm objectives and, in some cases, are likely to
exceed the Maastricht deficit limit of 3 percent
of GDP in the near term. The United Kingdom’s

fiscal position—a deficit of 3½ percent of GDP is
projected for 2008—is considerably weaker than
before the previous downturn.
The rules of the revised Stability and Growth
Pact provide room for fiscal objectives to be
adjusted in response to changing economic
conditions. With the effectiveness of discretionary easing diminished in the context of a loss
of confidence in financial markets, discretionary use of fiscal resources should be primarily
focused on measures to stabilize the financial
sector, as needed. More generally, given the
challenges associated with an aging population,
fiscal policy should be consistent with achieving
medium-term objectives. Automatic stabilizers
can be allowed to operate freely around the
adjustment path in response to weakening activity, except when this might breach fiscal rules.
Similarly, the United Kingdom should set policy
consistent with meeting its medium-term fiscal
rules. For 2009 and 2010, the agreed mediumterm expenditure plans should remain in place,
with automatic stabilizers allowed to operate
fully around the adjustment path.
Over the past six months, changes in policy
interest rates have been limited, and central
banks have focused on providing liquidity to
stressed markets. The European Central Bank
increased policy rates by 25 basis points to
4¼ percent in July 2008, the first move since June
2007, whereas the Bank of England has kept
rates unchanged at 5 percent since April 2008.
The projections see headline inflation falling
below 2 percent in the euro area and the United
Kingdom by end-2009. The immediate priority for
central banks is to maintain calm in financial markets by continuing to provide liquidity as needed.
However, the deteriorating outlook, moderating
inflation pressure, and tightening financial conditions provide scope for monetary easing in both
the euro area and the United Kingdom.
The continuing financial turmoil presents
important policy challenges on various fronts,
including because of complex cross-border
financial linkages and spillovers. The latter is a
particular concern for EU countries, given their
quest to build a single market in financial ser-

55

CHAPTER 2   Country and Regional Perspectives

vices. The specific challenges are already evident
as actions taken in specific countries to alleviate
financial strains are having adverse effects on
financial institutions in other countries. Addressing the concerns raised by spillovers will require
movement toward more joint responsibility and
accountability for financial stability, notably for
crisis prevention, management, and resolution,
in line with the commitments of the ECOFIN
Council of Finance Ministers in May 2008.
Restoring confidence now requires a decisive
commitment to concerted and coordinated
action to alleviate financial stresses and avoid
the serious risk of backtracking on European
financial integration.
The emphasis on policies to limit the damage from the financial turmoil should, however,
not distract from structural policy challenges.
Ten years following the introduction of the
euro, the main medium-term policy challenge
facing euro area member countries is to make
economic union as successful as monetary union
(Box 2.1). In this regard, productivity growth
has lagged that in other advanced economies,
and large and persistent intra-euro-area current
account divergences are raising concerns about
adjustment mechanisms in the monetary union.
Accordingly, the structural reform momentum needs to be kept up and reoriented in a
coordinated manner to improve adjustment in
response to intra-area disparities. The ongoing
reforms are bearing fruit, contributing to the
marked growth in employment and to improved
productivity in liberalized sectors. However,
large parts of the services sector remain unaffected, forfeiting important income, resilience,
and inflation benefits. Thus, the specific reform
recommendations under the Lisbon Agenda
that concern the euro area as a whole appropriately emphasize accelerating services market
reform and financial integration. Enhanced

policy coordination is needed to ensure greater
consistency of national reform programs with
these euro area recommendations.

Advanced Asia: Responding to External
Shocks
Although growth in Japan held up well
through the first quarter, rising commodity
prices and weakening external demand have
started to weigh on economic activity. In the
second quarter of 2008, the economy contracted
at a 3 percent quarter-over-quarter annualized
rate, and growth over the past four quarters was
below 1 percent. The recent decline was led by
private consumption and fixed investment, while
the contribution from net exports fell to zero
(Figure 2.3).
Recent indicators point to growing weakness ahead. Slowing external demand from
the United States and western Europe, rising
input costs, and diminishing profit expectations are weighing on corporate sentiment and
companies’ investment plans. At the same time,
high food and fuel prices and weakening wage
prospects have pushed consumer confidence
to low levels. Although financial conditions
have tightened to a lesser extent than in other
major economies, in part owing to Japanese
banks’ lower exposure to securitized products,
the stock market has fallen sharply, driven by
concerns about the weaker growth outlook.
Bank credit default swap (CDS) spreads have
risen on concerns about global financial strains
and the weaker outlook. Following the collapse
of Lehman Brothers, concerns about Japanese banks’ exposures to the failed institution
rose, contributing to a sharp widening of CDS
spreads for some entities and a broad-based fall

Although liquidity pressures have been less acute in
Japan than in other G3 economies, the Bank of Japan’s
significant liquidity provision also contributed to stabilizing money markets. See the Selected Issues paper accompanying the 2008 report on Article IV consultations with
Japan (available at www.imf.org) for more details on the
impact of the global financial turmoil on the Japanese
economy (IMF, 2008c).

Advanced Asia: Responding to External Shocks

in equity prices. Strains in the financial system
are expected to persist, even if to a lesser extent
than in the United States or western Europe.
Headline inflation has risen well above the
2007 level, to above 2 percent, on the back of
higher food and fuel prices, but core inflation,
excluding food and fuel, remains around zero.
Firms have started to pass through cost increases
to consumers, but they are also granting smaller
wage increases as activity is slowing and unit
labor costs continue to fall on a year-over-year
basis. Measures of inflation expectations suggest
that short-term expectations have edged up,
while long-term expectations remain contained.
Although the trade surplus deteriorated
because of a higher bill for commodity imports,
rising investment income helped keep the
current account balance near historical highs.
Through March 2008, the yen appreciated
against other major currencies, particularly the
U.S. dollar, reflecting an unwinding of carry
trades in volatile foreign exchange markets
(see Figure 2.3). Then the currency started to
weaken again, as expectations of monetary tightening dissipated amid slowing growth, before
resuming an appreciating trend in September owing to declining commodity prices and
increased risk aversion on the part of investors.
Given the medium-term prospects for continued
large external surpluses, the yen is still assessed
to be undervalued relative to medium-term
fundamentals.
As shown in Figure 2.3, Japan has experienced a much larger decline in its terms of
trade in past years than other major advanced
economies. Several factors have so far mitigated
the impact on activity. First, robust exports to
emerging and developing economies, many
of which are exporters of commodities, have
partly offset the effect of the deterioration in
Japan’s terms of trade. Second, although Japan
is dependent on imported oil for almost all its

Core inflation on the authorities’ definition (excluding only fresh food) has been running at about 2 percent,
reflecting recent increases in fuel and other commodity
prices.

Figure 2.3. Japan: How Well Would the Economy
Weather a Terms-of-Trade Shock?
The Japanese economy has been particularly exposed to deterioration in the terms of
trade. Robust exports to emerging and developing economies should provide
support for growth, but the outlook for consumption is weakening.

Box 2.1. EMU: 10 Years On
Ten years ago, EU heads of state gave the goahead for the third stage of European Economic
and Monetary Union (EMU), approving the introduction of the euro in 11 EU member countries
on January 1, 1999. Since then, four more EU
members have adopted the euro, and the Slovak
Republic is set to follow at the beginning of 2009.
Monetary union is a distinct success, and the
euro area is a zone of stability in the international
economy. Thanks to the high credibility of the
European Central Bank, inflation has declined
over the past decade, and inflation expectations
are now less variable in the euro area than in other
advanced economies (Beechey, Johannsen, and
Levin, 2008). The key remaining challenge on
the monetary front is the integration into the euro
area of all EU members that are committed to
adopting the euro (which does not include Denmark or the United Kingdom). Economic union,
however, remains a challenge even among the current euro area members, and there are concerns
about the area’s growth performance and large
intra-area current account divergences.
The record on growth. The widespread perception among observers that EMU has delivered economic stability but not growth is not
well founded. The EMU record with respect
to employment has been strong, which helps
explain why in per capita terms euro area real
GDP growth has not lagged behind U.S. growth
during EMU (first table). The euro area’s employment performance is in part related to EMU,
which likely has contributed to greater monetary
policy credibility, as well as labor market reforms,
including well ahead of the introduction of
the single currency in 1999. Employment rates
remain lower than in the United States, and per
capita income is still about 30 percent below U.S.
levels. However, full convergence is not likely:

Europeans have used the growth in productivity since World War II to increase leisure more
than in the United States (Blanchard, 2004), and
insofar as this greater leisure is sustainable, this
development is not undesirable.
The euro area’s poor productivity performance
under EMU has attracted much attention (for
example, Pisani-Ferry and others, 2008), but, as in
the case of economic growth, the reality may well
be more complex than the raw numbers suggest.
Labor productivity growth, for example, has averaged about 1 percent a year in the past 15 years,
down considerably compared with previous years.
Total factor productivity (TFP) growth has almost
ground to a halt during the current decade.
However, the low productivity growth may well be
related to the boom in employment, as argued by
Dew-Becker and Gordon (2008). In fact, there is

strong evidence for a negative relationship between
TFP growth and labor input in a cross section of EU
KLEMS data (van Ark, O’Mahony, and Ypma, 2007)
for 12 advanced economies and six sectors for each
country (see first figure). There could be many
reasons for such a trade-off. One obvious reason is
capital-labor substitution in response to reforms that
raised labor supply and, possibly, demand (via cuts
in payroll taxes). Accordingly, as the labor market
completes its adjustment to reforms and demographic changes, TFP growth may well revert to the
higher levels recorded in the 1980s.
There is still concern, however, that even with
adjustment for differences in labor input, TFP
growth on average has been lower in the euro
area than in the United States, particularly in the
service sectors. This points to a need to open up
the more sheltered service sectors to competition,
that is, to make services tradable.
The dispersion of real GDP growth rates has also
raised concern; however, business cycles among
EMU members have in fact become more synchronized as the importance of common shocks has
increased over time. These shocks now explain
some 60 percent of output developments, as
opposed to 30 percent before the introduction of
the euro (Stavrev, 2007). Furthermore, countryspecific developments in output reflect, to a considerable extent, per capita income convergence
to higher levels. Overall, the dispersion of growth
rates in the euro area is now similar to that among
U.S. states, although it is more persistent. The slow
speed of adjustment means that prolonged periods
of strong growth may be followed by prolonged
periods of sluggish activity, as experienced recently,
for example, by Portugal (Blanchard, 2007).
The record on the current account. The external
position of the euro area as a whole has remained
in balance since EMU inception and thus has not
raised concern. This external balance has been
preserved despite the significant appreciation of
the real effective exchange rate of the euro over
the past several years (see Chapter 1). In addition,
the euro has firmly established itself as the world’s
number two international currency, accounting for
more than one-quarter of international reserves
and more than one-half of trade invoicing.

account and competitiveness imbalances (see, for
example, European Commission, 2008). Current
account divergence among euro area members
appears large, ranging from deficits close to or
exceeding 10 percent of GDP (for example, in
Greece, Portugal, and Spain) to surpluses greater
than 5 percent of GDP (for example, in Germany
and the Netherlands—second table). In fact, this
divergence—measured by the standard deviation
across countries in each year—has risen substantially over the past two decades (second figure).
But is it unusually large for today’s world? As
Chapter 6 shows, greater divergence of current
account behavior is a widespread phenomenon.
A simple approach to determining whether the
divergence is unusually large is to divide the standard deviation of current accounts for euro area
countries by the same measure for the current
accounts of a group of 13 other advanced economies. The results show that this ratio has not

Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and United States). Data are from the April 2008

grown systematically. This is because the divergence among the other 13 advanced economies
has also been on the rise.
A related question is whether current account
imbalances are a reflection of equilibrium or
disequilibrium forces and how these have evolved
over time. To answer this question, a model of
equilibrium current account balances, based
closely on the IMF CGER methodology (Lee and
others, 2008), is used to compute the developments in deviations from equilibrium over time.
Specifically, the equilibrium current account for
each euro area country is obtained as a function
of real GDP growth, relative per capita income,
population growth, the net foreign-assets-to-GDP
ratio, the fiscal balance in percent of GDP, the
old-age dependency ratio, and the oil balance
in percent of GDP. The next step is to compute
for each year the sum across countries of the
absolute values of the deviation from equilibrium
current accounts. This shows that divergence
from equilibrium has not increased over time.
Although the size of divergence might not be
of major concern, slow adjustment to equilibrium
current account balances might be. Sustained deficits add to countries’ external debt and, unlike
in a currency union, such as the United States,
people cannot expect help from a federal author-

ity or easily move to better-off areas to improve
their repayment capacity. Moreover, in a currency union of countries, adverse economic
developments in parts of the union are more
likely to affect the strength of the union as a
whole. The persistence of the current account

imbalances in the EMU over time can be
gauged with a pooled univariate regression of
the current account balances on their own lags,
allowing for country-specific steady-state current
account balances (fixed effects). The results
suggest that since 1992 it takes roughly 10 years
to close about 70 percent of a gap between
actual and steady-state current accounts within
the euro area (see second figure). This speed
of adjustment is significantly lower than during
the pre-1992 period, when exchange rates were
more flexible, but has not slowed significantly
further during EMU. Moreover, it is significantly
lower than in the group of 13 other advanced
economies. However, the typical country-specific
current account shock in the euro area is only
about half as large as in the other countries
during 1992–2007, which is a mitigating factor.
In addition, it is only about half as large as
in 1970–91 within the euro area, which again
underscores the growing integration of EMU
members.
These results can gauge the implications of
today’s current account divergence for the net
foreign asset positions of euro area countries
(see second table). Clearly, some countries will
be footing considerably higher external debt
servicing bills that will limit consumption and
slow growth. Because there is a risk that during
periods of austerity the performance of EMU
might be questioned, it is imperative for policymakers to ensure that goods and factor markets
are flexible enough to deliver rapid adjustment:
boosting productivity is one way to foster internal
adjustment as are measures to foster more wage
flexibility (Blanchard, 2007). At the same time,
social safety nets need to provide sufficiently
generous but temporary help to those who suffer
from the dislocations that accompany adjustment. Moreover, internal adjustment processes
(via their effects on the union) concern all countries, and so addressing this challenge is a matter
of common interest. The European Union’s
Lisbon Agenda offers the right vehicle for the
design and implementation of the required structural reforms in a manner that leverages reform
spillovers and complementarities.

domestic needs, the efficiency with which oil is
used in the economy is much higher than in the
United States. Last, with underlying price pressures subdued, monetary conditions are likely to
remain accommodative.
The outlook envisages that growth in 2008–09
will be well below 1 percent, significantly below
potential. Although weakness in the United
States and western Europe will weigh appreciably on activity, growth in emerging economies is
expected to remain more resilient and should
continue to support exports. Private consumption is expected to remain moderate because
of weakening prospects for wage increases and
high food and fuel prices, while the weakening demand and profit outlook will slow private
investment.
The outlook is subject to considerable uncertainty surrounding the external environment,
with the overall risks tilted to the downside.
External risks relate mainly to a larger-thanexpected slowdown in emerging and developing economies and a renewed bout of global
financial instability. On the domestic front, high
commodity prices could weigh further on firms’
profits and households’ incomes.
Given the outlook for further weakening of
domestic demand and subdued inflation pressures, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) is appropriately
retaining an accommodative monetary policy
stance and keeping interest rates at the current
low levels until uncertainties over the outlook
are resolved. Japan has been battling deflation
for nearly a decade, and although an end to this
problem appears in sight, it is not yet ensured.
While core inflation on the authorities’ definition is close to the 2 percent upper bound of
the “understanding” of price stability by the BoJ
policy board members, wage growth is slowing,
and inflation expectations have been contained.
There are few indications of excessive risk taking
in asset markets (the second perspective of the
BoJ’s monetary policy framework) or of bubbles
in the financial or real estate markets.
The BoJ’s monetary policy framework encompasses
two perspectives: the short-term outlook for economic

62

A sharper-than-expected slowdown of the
economy may justify a further reduction of the
policy interest rate, although with the current
rate already at 50 basis points, room for easing
is limited. In this context, the BoJ’s move to
greater transparency, by expanding the discussion of the policy board members’ views on
the outlook and the risks to it and by placing a
greater emphasis on the 1 percent median of
the “understanding of price stability” in its communications, should help guide expectations.
Looking beyond the near term, the Japanese
economy continues to face a rapidly aging population and rising public debt. The pace of fiscal
consolidation has understandably slowed in the
environment of diminishing global growth, with
the general government primary deficit excluding social security expected to widen in 2008
and 2009 and discussions on raising the consumption tax rate postponed. In late August, the
Japanese government put forward an economic
stimulus package aimed at supporting faltering
growth. However, the scope for fiscal stimulus is
limited, and building fiscal space for projected
increases in expenditures owing to demographic
pressures remains a top priority for the medium
term. The authorities’ current plans, which target a primary balance by fiscal year 2011, need
to be strengthened further to prevent net public
debt from trending up.
Australia and New Zealand are slowing down
noticeably, after prolonged economic expansions driven by commodity and housing booms.
The expansions have stretched productive
capacity, pushing inflation to historical highs.
The authorities have responded by tightening
monetary policies, and domestic demand pressures have eased. Real GDP growth in Australia
is projected to fall below potential, to about
2½ percent in 2008–09 from 4¼ percent in 2007.
activity and prices and a longer-term outlook for risks to
the outlook, including from asset price bubbles.
The government’s proposal includes spending of
around $17 billion (0.4 percent of GDP) and government
guarantees for business loans. The government has also
committed to an income tax cut by the end of fiscal year
2008.

Emerging Asia: Balancing Risks to Growth and Price Stability

The recent moderation in domestic demand
and the tightening of credit conditions have
prompted the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA)
to cautiously ease monetary policy. The Reserve
Bank of New Zealand has also moved to ease
monetary policy. In both countries, sound fiscal
positions provide scope for allowing automatic
stabilizers to operate in full and for judicious
use of discretionary stimulus if the outlook deteriorates further.

expected ahead in response to slowing demand
from advanced economies and growing strains
in regional financial markets. Growth in China
eased to 10½ percent (year over year) in the first
half of 2008, from 12 percent in 2007, partly
because of slowing exports. Activity continued to
be supported by steady investment growth and
accelerating consumption. In India, growth in
the second quarter came down to about 8 percent, on the back of weakening investment,
while private consumption and export growth
have held up well. In the newly industrialized
Asian economies (NIEs) and the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) economies,
activity has also been decelerating. Domestic
demand has softened, as rising food and fuel
prices have started to weigh on consumption,
while declining profit margins and weakening
demand have prompted firms to scale back their
investment plans. Vietnam is undergoing a sharp
correction as the demand boom caused by large
capital inflows unwinds.
Financial markets have weakened in recent
months, driven by increasing concerns about
the global outlook and declining investor risk
appetite, particularly in the context of the
September market turbulence. Equity markets
that experienced the largest run-up in prices in
recent years—during 2005–07, prices more than
quadrupled in China and tripled in India—have
declined the most (Figure 2.4). In some coun-

Figure 2.4. Emerging Asia: Remaining Inflation
Concerns
Underlying inflation pressures rose across emerging Asia in recent quarters. Wage
increases, despite productivity improvements, have contributed to a buildup in
inflation in some cases. In part owing to a rapid expansion of bank loans, house
prices have continued to trend upward. In contrast, an extended run-up in equity
prices ended with a sharp correction in early 2008, triggered by global financial
turmoil. Exchange rates have failed to provide much respite for inflation, because
currencies have either appreciated too little or weakened.

tries, borrowing spreads have risen markedly for
banks relying on wholesale funding.
Current account balances have generally
come under pressure from rising import bills for
commodities and slowing export growth, while
capital account and exchange rate developments have varied. Capital inflows to China have
remained strong, as evidenced by a continuing
surge of foreign reserves in excess of the trade
surplus; capital flows to some other countries
have become more volatile, particularly to those
running sizable external deficits. Their currencies have come under pressure, prompting
central banks to intervene in support (India,
Pakistan, and Vietnam). The Korean won has
also weakened, partly owing to a turnaround in
the current account balance to a small deficit,
on the back of worsening terms of trade. Differing nominal exchange rate developments, in
turn, have driven divergent trends in real effective exchange rates, with the Chinese renminbi
and the ASEAN currencies continuing to appreciate, and the South Asian and NIEs’ currencies
weakening (see Figure 2.4).
Growth in the region is projected to moderate to 7¾ percent in 2008 and 7 percent in 2009
from 9¼ percent in 2007 (Table 2.3). Weakening
external demand is likely to weigh on exports,
but, in some cases, the impact may be mitigated
by still-loose macroeconomic policies and currency depreciation. Investment will also moderate, mainly because of deteriorating export
prospects. Consumption will ease because of
still-high fuel and food prices, although subsidies, which are common in the region, may
cushion the impact on purchasing power. The
risks to the outlook are firmly to the downside.
The main concern is that a buildup of stress in
the global financial system and a sharper-thananticipated global slowdown could further weigh
on activity. On the upside, domestic demand
may prove more resilient, with falling commodity prices providing a boost to real incomes.
Headline CPI inflation has soared in a number of countries on the back of increases in food
prices and administered fuel prices in the first
half of the year. Indicators of underlying infla-

64

tion pressure have risen to a lesser extent, but
some countries still face risks of further secondround effects. In China, headline CPI inflation
has steadily declined since its 8½ percent peak
in April, as food supply conditions have normalized. Core inflation has been rising gradually,
but remains contained. In India, CPI inflation
jumped to 9 percent in August. Underlying inflation pressures have increased, as high resource
utilization and robust credit growth have created
fertile ground for second-round effects (see
Figure 2.4). Insufficient policy tightening has
also contributed.
Although increases in food and fuel prices
may continue to subside in the coming months
and growth will moderate, inflation is expected
to remain at elevated rates over the near term.
Headline inflation is projected to rise to about
7¼ percent (year over year) in 2008 for the
region as a whole from 5 percent in 2007, before
declining to near 6 percent in 2009. Underlying
inflation pressures are also likely to remain high
in the environment of tight resource utilization
and still-loose macroeconomic policies.
Responses to rising inflation have varied
across the region. Some economies tightened
monetary policy—by hiking interest rates (India,
Indonesia, Korea, Philippines, Thailand, Taiwan
Province of China, and Vietnam), tightening
reserve requirements (Cambodia, India, Vietnam), and creating more scope for appreciation
in the exchange rate band (Singapore). More
recently, the People’s Bank of China lowered
the benchmark lending rates and reduced the
reserve requirement ratio, on concerns about
slowing growth. India and Korea intervened in
the foreign exchange market to support their
currencies. Countries that have continued to
accumulate foreign reserves have partially sterilized them through the issuance of bonds and
increases in reserve requirements to contain
the buildup of liquidity. Offsetting the effects
of monetary tightening, the fiscal policy stance
has been eased in many countries, however,
reflecting significant increases in fuel subsidies.
Although several countries have raised administered fuel prices (for example, Bangladesh,

China, India, Malaysia, and Vietnam), the
increase was small (except in Vietnam) compared with the increase in world fuel prices, and
in some cases resources raised have been used to
increase other expenditures, for example, food
subsidies. Several major rice exporters in the
region (Cambodia, China, India, and Vietnam)
introduced export bans, quotas, or taxes to
raise domestic food supplies and lower domestic
prices, adding to pressure on world prices.
Against this background, a major policy
dilemma for the region is how to respond to
the weakening growth outlook and global
financial turbulence, without losing sight of
inflation risks. Although there is considerable
divergence in country circumstances, downside
risks to growth in emerging Asia have risen in
recent months, while inflation risks have moderated as food and oil prices came down from
the peaks observed earlier in the year. Policy
priorities have shifted accordingly, although
there remain notable differences in country
circumstances.

• In most countries domestic demand is weakening rapidly and some policy tightening has
already taken place. Although authorities
need to remain alert to inflation risks, policy
easing could be justified if downside risks
to growth are significant. In countries with
strong fiscal positions, automatic stabilizers
can be allowed to operate in full. However,
the use of discretionary fiscal policy needs to
be approached with caution, as past experience suggests that such actions are difficult
to time well and have not been very effective
(see Chapter 5). But it could be justified in
the face of deteriorating growth prospects
in countries with strong underlying fiscal
positions.
• By contrast, in a few countries where growth
is expected to remain relatively strong,
where risks for further second-round inflation effects are higher, and where monetary
policy credibility has not yet been firmly
established—macroeconomic policies still
need to lean toward tightening (for example,

65

CHAPTER 2   Country and Regional Perspectives

in Indonesia and Vietnam). Monetary policy
tightening should be the first line of defense
against rising inflation but may need to
be complemented in some cases by greater
exchange rate flexibility or fiscal action.
Fiscal restraint could help reduce inflation
pressures, especially in countries where rising
food and fuel subsidies, as well as public wage
increases, have weakened fiscal positions and
contributed to price pressures.

Latin America and the Caribbean:
Navigating a More Perilous Environment
As in other parts of the world, Latin American economies are facing an awkward combination of slowing activity, more difficult external
conditions, and still-high inflation. After four
years of strong output growth, the pace eased
in most economies of the region during the
first half of 2008, largely because of moderating
exports. Domestic demand has remained quite
robust so far this year, sustained by terms-oftrade gains for commodity exporters, but is
expected to be dampened as the global economy slows and by the shift toward monetary
policy tightening to contain inflation. Countries
in the region have also been facing more difficult external conditions in recent months. Latin
America has been increasingly affected by turbulent conditions in mature financial markets,
with equity prices falling sharply, spreads widening markedly, access to dollar funding tightening appreciably, and exchange rates coming
under pressure, especially in commodity-exporting countries facing lower export prices.
Overall, GDP growth is projected to come
down from 5½ percent in 2007 to 4½ percent
in 2008 and 3¼ percent in 2009 (Table 2.4).
The somewhat sharper deceleration in 2009
than envisaged in the July 2008 World Economic Outlook Update reflects the weaker global
outlook, softer commodity prices, and more
difficult external financial conditions. Growth
in Brazil would come down below trend, and
activity would remain sluggish in Mexico as
exports and remittances are dampened by the

66

U.S. slowdown. Growth in Central America and
the Caribbean is also expected to ease, reflecting the impact of slow U.S. growth on remittances, trade, and tourism, as well as high fuel
costs.
Headline inflation for the region as a whole
rose to 8 percent in August, the highest rate
in five years, although it is expected to moderate in the latter part of 2008 and 2009,
helped by softening international commodity
prices, tighter monetary policies, and slowing
demand growth. Still, inflation will remain at
double-digit levels in a number of countries
in the region, including Bolivia, Paraguay, the
República Bolivariana de Venezuela, and several Central American countries, and analysts
believe that actual inflation in Argentina is considerably higher than the official rate of 9.0 percent in August (Figure 2.5). Although nominal wage growth has remained under control
in most countries, high inflation expectations
are feeding into wage negotiations in countries
such as Argentina and the República Bolivariana de Venezuela, where capacity constraints
are tight. In countries with inflation-targeting
central banks—Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico,
and Peru—inflation has also risen, in some
cases above target ranges, but increases have
generally been more contained than elsewhere
in the region, and there are signs of stabilizing or even declining inflation expectations for
some countries.
In response, central banks have raised policy
interest rates, most actively in the inflation-targeting countries, where exchange rate appreciation has also helped contain inflation pressures.
In Brazil, monetary policy tightening has been
supported by an increase in the primary fiscal
surplus target for 2008 by ½ percentage point of
GDP. However, fiscal policy has not in general
been restrictive across the region, in part because
of the budgetary impact of delayed pass-through

Data for CPI inflation for several provincial capitals for
August 2008 are generally well above this rate, although it
should be noted that provincial data do not reflect price
changes on the same basket of goods.

of international oil price increases and increased
explicit subsidies. Although inflation should now
gradually recede, monetary tightening is still
warranted in some countries where real interest rates have become significantly negative and
there is a sense that policy credibility is being
eroded. Central banks with inflation-targeting
regimes have earned some limited scope to tolerate temporary deviations of headline inflation
from objectives, but, depending on evolving
risks to activity, some may still need to raise rates
further. At the same time, tighter control over
the growth of government spending would help
restrain domestic demand growth and reduce
exposure to adverse shifts in market sentiment.
External positions are generally robust,
although the turbulence in the global economy
may erode the cushions that have been built
up over the past few years. The region’s current account balance is expected to move to
deficit in 2008 and 2009, after being in surplus
since 2003, but the deficit will remain quite low.
Moreover, reserve levels are high, and flexible
exchange rates provide room to maneuver in
a number of countries. Overall, public sector

balance sheet vulnerabilities have been reduced
and credit ratings raised—Brazil and Peru both
achieved “investment grade” ratings in recent
months. However, conditions for U.S. dollar
funding have tightened in several countries over
the past month, which—together with a sustained drop in commodity prices—could stretch
macroeconomic policy frameworks.
Risks to this outlook are to the downside,
largely related to external developments. A
deeper downturn in global growth could trigger
a sharp drop in commodity prices, while external
financing conditions facing Latin America could
continue to tighten. Such a scenario would slow
growth in the region even more, and although
inflation would moderate considerably, external
positions could come under serious stress. In this
event, policymakers would need to stand ready to
adapt policies as needed to preserve macroeconomic stability and the prospects for long-term
growth. Those few countries with very strong
fiscal positions may have some scope for a countercyclical fiscal response. Flexible exchange rate
management would provide resilience in the face
of potentially volatile foreign exchange flows.

Following a prolonged economic expansion, activity in emerging Europe has started to
moderate and a significant slowdown appears in
the offing. Weaker external demand, especially
owing to the cooling of demand in western
Europe, and tighter external financing conditions are weighing on investment and exports,
while private consumption has slowed in the
face of soaring food and energy prices. Nonetheless, ongoing expansion of productive capacity
and rapid lending to the private sector by mostly
foreign banks (particularly in Bulgaria and
Romania) have continued to support domestic demand, although prospects for continued
strong capital inflows have weakened noticeably.
The Baltics, notably Estonia and Latvia, are
already undergoing sharp corrections as large
domestic and external imbalances that had
accumulated during drawn-out consumptionand-investment booms are starting to unwind
(Figure 2.6). With real incomes eroded by high
debt service and inflation and with foreign
banks pulling back loan expansion on increasing
concerns about a buildup of imbalances, private
consumption and, to a lesser extent, investment
have plummeted and current account deficits
have started to decline.
Amid still-buoyant domestic demand and
still-tight labor markets, inflation has been
further boosted by increases in food and energy
prices. By June 2008, headline inflation in most
countries was double what it was a year earlier,
reaching double digits in the Baltics (especially
Latvia), Bulgaria, and Turkey. Underlying inflation has also climbed because of rising wages
(for example, in Poland and the Slovak Republic) and strong demand pressures (particularly
in Bulgaria, Romania, and Turkey). There is also
evidence of second-round effects from surging
food and energy prices, and inflation expectations have edged up in many countries. With
inflation targets exceeded by wide margins,
monetary policy has been tightened in central and eastern Europe (CEE), Romania, and

Emerging Europe: Prospects for a Soft Landing

Turkey in the context of floating exchange rate
regimes. In the CEE economies, strengthening
currencies and good harvests have helped combat inflation pressures. However, countries with
fixed exchange rates (the Baltics and Bulgaria)
have had less room to tighten the monetary
stance; in Romania and Turkey, currency depreciation contributed to inflation despite interest
rate increases. Nonetheless, in Estonia, Hungary,
and Latvia, inflation pressures have started to
ebb in the course of economic corrections (see
Figure 2.6).
Growth is expected to continue to decelerate
markedly, including on account of diminishing
capital inflows and tighter financial constraints.
In the CEE economies, growth is projected
to ease from about 6 percent in 2007 to near
4½ percent in 2008 and 3½ percent in 2009
(Table 2.5). Weakening demand from western
Europe will slow exports and investment, and
high inflation will take a toll on real incomes
and consumption. Growth in southern and
southeastern Europe (SEE) and Turkey will also
weaken, as a worsening external outlook and
still-high commodity prices weigh on consumption and investment. Corrections in the Baltics
are expected to continue, with growth projected
to drop from an average of near 9 percent in
2007 to 1¼ percent in 2008 and to –¼ percent
in 2009. The economies are projected to start
to recover gradually during the second half of
2009. Inflation pressures are expected to ease
in 2009 as increases in commodity prices and
domestic cost and demand pressures subside.
The risks to the outlook are tilted to the
downside. They relate to deterioration in external financing conditions, larger than expected
weakening of external demand, and renewed
increases in commodity prices. Countries with
large current account deficits financed in part
by non-foreign-direct-investment capital inflows
are particularly vulnerable to a sharp reversal
of capital inflows. In some countries in emerging Europe, large nonresident holdings of local
currency bonds, extensive domestic borrowing in foreign currencies, and dependence of
some financial institutions on wholesale fund-

Figure 2.6. Emerging Europe: Are Credit Booms
Cooling Off?
Credit to the private sector has expanded at a much faster rate in the Baltics, Bulgaria,
and Romania than in other countries in the region. Credit booms have been
accompanied by a buildup of significant external imbalances. Estonia and Latvia are
now undergoing a sharp correction, while consumption and GDP continue to grow
briskly in Bulgaria and Romania and, to a lesser extent, in Lithuania. Core inflation
and growth of unit labor costs have started to stabilize in Estonia and Latvia, while in
Bulgaria, Lithuania, and Romania inflation pressures remain strong.

ing from abroad accentuate vulnerabilities to
further changes in market sentiment. Beyond
these risks, there is considerable uncertainty
about the pace of adjustment in the Baltics. An
even-sharper-than-projected slowdown cannot be ruled out, should external or domestic
confidence plummet. The downturn may also
be more prolonged than expected, if the labor
markets, which must adjust to restore competitiveness, proves to be less flexible than expected.
Financial risks have risen appreciably with the
onset of the turbulence in advanced financial
markets. Although banks operating in emerging
Europe have little if any direct exposure to the
U.S. subprime market, they (and their foreign
parents) have been affected by the widening
turmoil in western Europe. A decline in global
risk appetite has raised liquidity risks by increasing banks’ external funding costs and shortening maturities. Credit risks have also risen: the
credit boom was accompanied by lengthening
maturities, rising loan-to-value ratios, and more
exposure to riskier products (for example,
yen-denominated loans in Hungary and Swiss-

70

franc-denominated loans in Poland, including
at variable rates). A recent deceleration in real
estate prices, at least in some countries, makes
banks more vulnerable to credit risk. Foreign
currency lending is widespread, in both fixedexchange-rate countries (for example, most
lending is done in euros in the Baltics) and in
floating-exchange-rate countries (for example,
in Hungary and Romania, foreign currency
loans accounted for about 60 percent of total
household loans in 2007). Lower equity prices
and rising bond spreads have raised funding
costs.
The policy challenge is how to engineer a soft
landing, while continuing to lay the groundwork
for sustainable convergence to western European living standards.
• In the CEE economies, the risks to inflation
and growth appear balanced, justifying keeping monetary policy on hold for the moment,
although the balance of risks hinges on
unpredictable capital flows and exchange rate
developments. Fiscal positions have recently
been strengthened by buoyant revenues and

Commonwealth of Independent States: Managing the Commodity Price Boom

spending restraint, but there is little room for
automatic stabilizers to operate in full. Continued fiscal consolidation would help widen
these margins and unburden monetary policy.
Public finances need to be put on a sustainable long-term path to meet the challenges
posed by population aging and to support
continued convergence with the euro area,
particularly in the Slovak Republic, which is
scheduled to adopt the euro in January 2009.
Addressing remaining rigidities in the labor
market would facilitate long-term fiscal adjustment while easing labor market constraints
and wage pressures.
• In the Baltics, macroeconomic adjustment
needs to run its course. Although domestic
demand pressures are subsiding, especially in
Estonia and Latvia, external imbalances still
loom large, inflation is at double-digit levels,
and confidence is weakening. It is important
to resist the temptation to significantly ease
fiscal policy in the downturn, considering that
these economies’ high degree of openness
would limit its impact on demand. It will be
important to claw back unsustainable expenditure increases from the recent past and target structural balance over the medium term.
There is also a need for heightened supervisory vigilance and contingency plans for
financial institutions to deal with potentially
significant loan losses from the economic
downturn. This will require close collaboration between domestic and foreign prudential
authorities, given the large share of foreignowned banks.
• In the SEE economies, action is needed to
rein in rising external and internal imbalances, mindful of the more volatile external
financing conditions. Like the Baltics several
years ago, these countries are still enjoying
“good times,” and fiscal and income policies
need to avoid adding procyclical impulses
to the already overheating private sector.
Specifically, growth in public expenditures
needs to be contained by keeping public
wage increases in line with productivity
growth and reducing the size of government,

in conjunction with reforms to raise the efficiency of the public sector. With credit to the
private sector growing at double-digit rates,
maintaining high prudential standards—and
rigorously applying them—is critical in
order to prevent weakening credit standards.
Again, close cross-border collaboration will
be important, for the same reasons as in the
Baltics.

Commonwealth of Independent States:
Managing the Commodity Price Boom
Real GDP growth has been strong in most
countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), underpinned by buoyant
domestic demand that has been boosted by
terms-of-trade gains in most countries in the
region and expansionary macroeconomic policies. However, growth prospects are deteriorating as the region has been affected by the
global financial turmoil, notably Kazakhstan
and, more recently, Russia, which have been
confronted by loss of confidence and a sharp
turn in capital flows. Weakening demand from
partner countries would add to the effects on
growth of unsettled financial markets.
High world prices for food and fuel have
contributed significantly to inflation pressures
across the region. Partly as a result of the high
weight of food in household consumption,
headline inflation accelerated sharply during
the first half of 2008, reaching nearly 15 percent by the summer (Figure 2.7). Moreover,
core inflation has picked up around the region,
reflecting the combination of strains from rising commodity prices and domestic demand
pressures. Thus, there are concerns about overheating, with output consistently above potential and labor markets remaining tight. The
policy stance generally continues to be expansionary across the region; interest rates have
turned negative in real terms, while government
spending continues to expand rapidly. High
international commodity prices have continued to boost trade balances in net commodity
exporters, while net commodity importers have

seen a marked weakening in their external positions. Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan have benefited most from
terms-of-trade gains, whereas terms of trade in
Armenia, Moldova, and Tajikistan have worsened. In net food importers, food balances have
deteriorated significantly, with deficits reaching precarious levels in some countries. Linked
to the rising cost of food imports, the Kyrgyz
Republic received an augmented disbursement
from the IMF in May to help meet a larger than
expected balance of payments shortfall.
In response to slowing external demand and
emerging financial market pressure, real GDP
growth is projected to slow from 7¼ percent this
year to about 5¾ percent in 2009 (Table 2.6).
Notwithstanding recent oil price declines,
output is expected to grow at a solid pace in net
energy exporters, where terms-of-trade gains
should continue to boost demand, whereas net
energy importers will likely see their growth
momentum weaken noticeably. In Russia, the
growth forecast for 2008 reflects a stronger-thanexpected performance early in the year, rising
terms-of-trade gains, and a larger-than-expected
fiscal stimulus package. But growth is set to
weaken appreciably, reflecting slowing world
demand and tightening financial conditions.
In Kazakhstan, growth is expected to remain
relatively subdued as the excesses of the earlier
credit boom unwind, although the still-buoyant
oil sector should continue to partially offset the
effects of the credit crunch. In Ukraine, the
growth forecast for 2008 reflects strong performance during the first half of the year, termsof-trade gains, and indications of a bumper
harvest. Going forward, growth is projected to
decelerate markedly, reflecting weaker export
market growth, slowing real wage increases,
moderating terms-of-trade gains, and higher
financing costs.
Risks to the outlook have moved to the
downside. Financial market uncertainties are a
source of concern, notably for countries with
rapidly expanding current account deficits,
such as Ukraine, and for other countries that
are already heavily reliant on capital inflows.

Although further monetary and fiscal tightening
is expected in the second half of 2008, the nearterm effects on activity and inflation will likely
be limited. Accordingly, inflation risks are still
on the upside for net commodity importers and
exporters alike.
Inflation is now expected to be higher than
projected in the April 2008 World Economic
Outlook, 15½ percent this year and 12½ percent
next year, reflecting intensifying price pressures amid persistently high commodity prices
and little spare capacity. Against this backdrop,
monetary policy effectiveness generally remains
constrained by inflexible exchange rate regimes,
although in Ukraine the exchange rate was
recently revalued within a widened trading
band. To compensate, governments in CIS
countries have resorted to a variety of fiscal and
trade measures in order to contain inflation
pressures and alleviate the social impact of rising
food prices. These measures include reducing
or eliminating import taxes and tariffs on key

food items, cutting back domestic consumption
taxes or stepping up subsidies for food and fuel,
introducing direct price caps on key food items,
and imposing export taxes and quotas. Some
countries have introduced short-term supplyoriented measures, mainly subsidies and other
supports to agriculture. However, the fiscal costs
of these measures have reached disconcerting
proportions in a number of economies, raising
concerns about fiscal sustainability.
For as long as inflation pressure is not
projected to diminish markedly from presently
elevated levels, stronger policy action is needed
in many countries across the region in order
to ensure that long-term inflation expectations
remain firmly anchored. A comprehensive
policy response would require a combination
of monetary tightening and greater exchange
rate flexibility, combined with a prudent fiscal stance. In particular, universal subsidies,
which reinforce domestic demand pressures
and burden public resources, could usefully be
73

CHAPTER 2   Country and Regional Perspectives

replaced with temporary and targeted measures
to alleviate the social effects of soaring food and
energy prices on vulnerable segments of the
population. In this regard, export restrictions
and other policy interventions that prevent the
needed supply adjustment are likely to prove
counterproductive.
Over the longer term, the region continues to
face the challenge of reducing its sensitivity to
commodity price shocks through diversification
of the economy away from primary commodities. Further efforts to improve the business
climate; increase competition, including in the
food and energy sectors; strengthen domestic
financial systems; and continue to build market
institutions more broadly would foster stronger
performance and reduce vulnerabilities associated with terms-of-trade shifts.

Sub-Saharan Africa: A Test of Policy
Frameworks
Economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa
(SSA) is expected to moderate in the face of
the financial turmoil and high energy and food
prices, even though many SSA countries are
benefiting from terms-of-trade gains resulting from the surge in other commodity prices.
Overall, growth is projected to decline from
near 7 percent in 2007 to just over 6 percent in
2008–09. However, there are important crosscountry variations (Figure 2.8 and Table 2.7).
Despite a weakening external environment,
economic expansion in oil-exporting countries is expected to soften only moderately
in 2008–09, with growth declining to about
7½ percent from near 8 percent in 2007, owing
to a near 75 percent improvement in the terms
of trade in 2008. For oil importers, the terms of
trade would remain broadly stable in 2008, with
higher oil prices offset by higher export prices
for metals, coffee, cocoa, and cotton.10 However,

10Oil importers stand to benefit from higher prices for
metals (Botswana, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Mozambique,
Senegal, South Africa, Togo, Uganda, and Zambia), coffee, cocoa, and cotton (Burundi, Côte d’Ivoire, Ethiopia,

74

the countries hit hardest (Benin, The Gambia,
Kenya, Madagascar, Rwanda, and Sierra Leone)
are projected to experience a 15–20 percent
deterioration in the terms of trade. In South
Africa, SSA’s largest economy, electricity shortages early in 2008 and the need for a 500-basispoint rise in policy interest rates since mid-2006
to contain inflation are expected to slow growth
from 5 percent in 2007 to about 3½ percent
in 2008–09. The risks to the regional growth
outlook are tilted to the downside and relate
mainly to slower-than-expected growth in global
demand and slowing capital inflows.
Recent sharp increases in food and fuel
prices pose significant challenges for price
stability across SSA. Inflation is expected to rise
from about 7 percent in 2007 to near 12 percent
in 2008, before easing to 9½ percent in 2009,
although the average masks significant variation
across countries. Food price rises tend to have
a large impact on inflation in SSA, reflecting
a high share of food in consumer baskets (see
Chapter 3). Domestic demand pressures, which
have emerged in some SSA countries during
the past several years of robust growth, may also
be amplifying the initial impact of food and
fuel price shocks through second-round effects
on inflation.
Against the backdrop of rising inflation,
the impact of higher food prices on poverty is
a major concern as it risks undermining past
progress in this area and putting social cohesion at risk. SSA countries’ strong dependence
on imports of food and fuel as well as a high
incidence of poverty make them most vulnerable to increases in prices of these commodities. Populations in these countries have few
options to hedge against rising food prices, and
the urban poor tend to suffer most. The IMF
staff estimates that rising prices for imported
food would have the largest impact on poverty in The Gambia, Ghana, Mauritania, and
Swaziland owing to their high dependence on
Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, and Zambia, among others).
For more details on the effects of the recent commodity
price shock, see Chapter 3 and IMF (2008a).

Sub-Saharan Africa: A Test of Policy Frameworks

imports and low incomes (IMF, 2008a). Some
countries have responded to rising inflation
pressures by tightening monetary policy, but
many have reduced import tariffs and the valueadded tax on food or have imposed export
taxes and other restrictions.
The external positions of oil-importing countries are also coming under pressure because
of surging prices of imported food and fuel.
Current account deficits in oil-importing countries are projected to deteriorate on average
from about 5 percent of GDP in 2007 to about
5¾ percent of GDP in 2008 and 6¼ percent
in 2009. In South Africa, a widening current
account deficit, which stood at 7¼ percent of
GDP in the second quarter of 2008, is of particular concern. The deficit is financed largely
through volatile portfolio flows, although low
external debt and a flexible exchange rate
should provide some resilience if capital flows
were to reverse. By contrast, current account
balances in oil-exporting countries are in surplus and are projected to strengthen further,
from 8 percent in 2007 to 13½ percent in 2008
and about 8 percent in 2009.
The main challenge for the region is how to
respond to the large commodity price shock
and the threat of slowing capital inflows. Oilimporting countries, where the negative termsof-trade shock has weakened fiscal and external
positions, need to adjust their monetary, fiscal,
and income policies. Delaying the adjustment
would put at risk not only macroeconomic stability but also recent achievements in improving
policy and institutional frameworks, which have
been largely responsible for SSA’s impressive
growth performance in recent years.
• Countries with managed or fixed exchange
rates need to tighten monetary policies
through interest rate increases or administrative measures to prevent inflation expectations from becoming ingrained and to
strengthen the balance of payments and
fiscal positions. A reduction in public sector
borrowing and greater exchange rate flexibility would support monetary tightening and
ease pressure on the balance of payments.

Figure 2.8. Sub-Saharan Africa: The Mixed Blessing of
High Commodity Prices
At the aggregate level, growth in Africa is expected to show some resilience to the
global slowdown, as many countries benefit from improvement in the terms of trade
owing to a surge in fuel and nonfuel commodity prices, and net capital inflows to the
region remain broadly steady. Nonetheless, there are dramatic differences in the
economic performance of oil importers and exporters, with the former experiencing a
significant deterioration in their current account and fiscal positions, as well as a
sharp rise in inflation.

• At the same time, targeted fiscal measures,
including subsidies, are needed to help
protect the poor. These measures would need
to be complemented by steps to safeguard
the long-term budget position, including a
gradual yet full pass-through of international
oil prices to consumer prices as better-targeted measures are put in place for the poor.
Price controls on food items are likely to be
ineffective, leading to shortages and budgetary costs rather than reduced inflation.
• Additional donor assistance is needed to
cushion the impact of adjustment on vulnerable countries that have high poverty
levels, limited access to foreign financing,

76

low reserve cushions, and high external or
public debt levels. Such funding would allow
these countries to meet higher import bills
and provide targeted budget assistance to the
poorest segments of the population while the
necessary adjustments are phased in. Over
the longer term, donor assistance could seek
to promote the development of domestic
agriculture and sustainable social safety nets.
Oil-exporting countries face the challenge of
managing the windfall gains from high commodity prices more successfully than during
similar past episodes, which failed to produce
permanent improvements in living standards.
Rising current account surpluses and inflation

Middle East: Overheating Still A Concern

pressures call for close coordination between
monetary and fiscal policies. Saving a portion of
oil revenues would help mitigate emerging inflation pressures while laying a solid financial basis
for addressing vital infrastructure, health, and
social needs. Monetary tightening could help
stabilize inflation and guard against the development of a generalized inflation process. Allowing nominal exchange rates to appreciate would
also help keep inflation under control.

Middle East: Overheating Still a Concern
Activity continues to grow at a robust pace in
much of the Middle East, while inflation pressures either remain high or keep rising, particularly in a number of oil exporters. Real GDP
growth in Middle Eastern countries is projected
to weaken only modestly during 2008–09, from
6½ percent to just below 6 percent, with oil
exporters and non-oil economies growing at a
similar pace (Table 2.8). The effects of falling
demand in advanced partner economies and
increasing supply-side constraints in oil sectors are projected to be partly offset by robust
domestic demand and activity in non-oil sectors.
Rising oil and food prices are posing important
budgetary challenges for many non-oil economies. By contrast, the global financial turmoil
has had relatively little effect on the region thus
far, beyond pressing stock markets to surrender
earlier gains.
Economic growth is being sustained mainly
by non-oil sectors, as capacity constraints are
slowing oil output growth (Figure 2.9). Growth
in oil exporters is being driven by private
construction, retail trade, transportation, and
financial services. Aside from the indirect effect
of high oil revenues, the strength reflects an
improved business environment that is fostering private investment and a buildup in public
projects to alleviate infrastructure and housing
bottlenecks that have accumulated with rapid
population growth. Notwithstanding record oil
prices, recent activity in the oil sector has been
noticeably less buoyant than in the non-oil sector. Despite heavy investment, production and

distribution capacity are rising slowly, owing
to soaring investment costs, technological and
geological constraints, and the depletion of
existing fields. Still, oil and natural gas production capacity and, to a lesser extent, output are
projected to expand moderately in 2008–09,
with significant new capacity in Qatar and Saudi
Arabia. Real GDP growth in the non-oil economies is benefiting from past efforts to improve
their business environments. Sizable FDI inflows
are boosting activity in Egypt and Jordan, while
Lebanon is continuing to recover from the conflict in 2006.
Signs of overheating are multiplying. Inflation has reached double-digit rates even in some
countries with traditionally low rates, such as
Saudi Arabia, and exceeds 20 percent in Egypt
and the Islamic Republic of Iran. The surge in
inflation has occurred despite limited passthrough of high fuel and, to a lesser extent,
food prices to domestic markets.11 Not surprisingly, although inflation is still driven mainly
by foreign-determined prices (including the
depreciation of the U.S. dollar against third
currencies), pressures are increasingly spilling
over into domestically determined prices of
nontraded goods. This is particularly true in
oil-exporting countries, where expanding and
wealthier populations and an influx of foreign
workers are putting pressure on services prices,
notably for housing, and where governments
are granting large wage hikes. However, other
countries are beginning to see broader pressures
too. Accordingly, despite the technical assumptions of no further real effective exchange rate
depreciation and broadly unchanged prices for
fuel and food, inflation is expected to retreat
only moderately in 2009.
At the same time, robust domestic demand
is driving an acceleration of imports across the
region. Current account developments differ
widely between oil exporters and non-oil economies. Oil exporters are recording large and

items typically have a combined weight of
between one-quarter and one-third in consumption baskets, with the bulk accounted for by food.

growing surpluses, generally projected to reach
10–45 percent of GDP in 2008–09. In the other
countries, deficits have widened in response to
rising import costs—to double-digit levels in Jordan and Lebanon, but to still-low levels in Egypt.
The risks to the growth outlook remain
broadly balanced. External risks are mostly to
the downside and relate to weaker demand in
advanced economies and potentially lower oil
prices. Capital inflows to deficit countries could
take a hit if global financial conditions were to
worsen suddenly, and access to funding by major
nonfinancial corporations could also become
more difficult. Upside risks relate to still-robust
domestic demand and foreign investors’ continued strong interest from within (notably the
Gulf Cooperation Council—GCC—countries)
and outside the region. However, if upside risks
materialize and exacerbate inflation pressure,
this would further complicate macroeconomic
policies.
In this setting, warding off mounting inflation
pressures requires addressing growing imbalances. Countries that are not pegging exchange
rates to foreign currencies (for example, Egypt
and the Islamic Republic of Iran) can further

78

tighten monetary policy while enhancing its
effectiveness through greater exchange rate
flexibility. In countries with pegged exchange
rates, monetary policy is imported from abroad,
mainly from the United States. In many oil
exporters, currencies are undervalued, although
by varying degrees, and higher inflation is
contributing to an appreciation of real effective
exchange rates. The main driver of the undervaluation is the peg to the U.S. dollar, which
has been depreciating while terms of trade have
been improving. Once domestic prices have
completely adjusted to the higher levels that
are consistent with an appreciated real effective exchange rate, inflation pressures should
subside, provided the peg and fiscal policy effectively anchor expectations.
The move to a new equilibrium could also be
achieved through a revaluation of currencies,
but this would be complex, particularly in the
GCC countries, which plan to move to monetary
union in 2010. First, revaluations would introduce uncertainty as to how policy would respond
to external shocks in the future, undermining the value of the peg as a nominal anchor.
Second, many pegging countries still need to

Middle East: Overheating Still A Concern

Real GDP growth is forecast to remain buoyant, mainly on account of activity in
non-oil sectors. Inflation pressure is rising, and tighter fiscal policies are needed to
keep inflation expectations well anchored, particularly in non-oil economies, which
are also experiencing widening current account deficits.

develop both their capacity to conduct an independent monetary policy and the underlying
financial market infrastructure. Third, volatility
in oil markets could lead to volatile exchange
rates under a floating regime, which might
hamper some countries’ efforts to diversify their
export bases. Some of these issues would be
addressed by a switch from a peg to the U.S. dollar to a peg to a basket of currencies that better
reflects the composition of trade and services
exchange with the rest of the world. However,
had such a peg been in place recently, it would
not have made a major difference with respect
to excess demand pressures, as is evidenced by
Kuwait’s experience. In the long run, however,
if inflation persists, a switch to a basket peg is
an option worth exploring. Overall, the extent
of the role of the exchange rate in managing
demand pressure has to depend on country-specific circumstances, including the potential for
adjustments in fiscal policy and GCC countries’
commitment to peg their currencies to the U.S.
dollar in the period leading up to monetary
union.
Fiscal policy will be central in restraining
demand pressures in Middle Eastern economies. Many non-oil economies have significantly reduced debt levels over the past decade.
Nonetheless, domestic debt levels remain high
by international standards, and thus both conjunctural and medium-term requirements point
toward fiscal tightening. In oil exporters, the
rise in oil prices has provided fiscal room for a
buildup in government spending but has added
to pressures on domestic resources. As a result
of rapidly rising expenditures on wages and
subsidies, for example, the oil price at which
countries’ budgets balance over the medium
term has been on the rise. The specific fiscal
policy requirements vary, but generally would
need to emphasize cutbacks in current spending
while continuing to support critical infrastructure projects that alleviate internal supply-side
bottlenecks. Furthermore, fiscal policy can
also help address the social challenges posed
by high energy and food prices. The development of more-targeted transfer programs would

help tackle poverty and, in oil exporters, share
the gains from higher oil prices. As progress
is made, high outlays on general oil and food
subsidies––reaching about 10 percent of GDP in
Egypt and Saudi Arabia, for example––need to
be rolled back.
Over the medium term, stronger macroeconomic policy frameworks and continued structural reforms are important for strengthening
the resilience of Middle Eastern economies to
shocks and to providing for a young and rapidly
expanding population. Fiscal policies could
usefully be imparted with a longer-term orientation––for example, with the help of mediumterm budgetary frameworks––because of the
need to lower debt in non-oil economies and
in preparation for lower oil revenues in some
oil exporters. The capacity to conduct independent monetary policy and to support financial
markets needs to be enhanced. As domestic
financial systems become more complex, rising
regulatory and supervisory challenges will need
to be addressed. Moreover, many countries stand
to benefit from further improvements in their
business environments, including by increasing
investment in education and strengthening the
social safety net.

Is Inflation Back?
Commodity Prices and Inflation

This chapter examines the current commodity price
boom and evaluates the risks that the associated relative price adjustment could ratchet up inflation, as
during the 1970s. Despite some recent easing in commodity prices, many of the forces underlying the boom
are still in place, and prices will likely remain at high
levels by historical standards. Continuing inflation
risks arise from the large increases in commodity prices
that have not fed fully through the supply chain. Most
vulnerable to risks of a ratcheting up in inflation are
those economies with a high likelihood of second-round
effects—where commodities account for a large share
of final expenditure and where monetary policy has
only limited credibility, where there are price pressures
from other sources such as overheating, and where the
macroeconomic policy response to rising inflation has
been inadequate.

C

ould the large commodity price surge
of the past year and a half signal an
end to a decade or so of price stability
and herald a return to the type of high
inflation seen during the 1970s? This question
continues to be widely debated, even as commodity prices have begun to ease since mid-July.
In many economies, headline inflation rates
remain at levels last seen 10 to 15 years ago, and
core inflation is still rising, particularly in emerging and developing economies.
Although there is broad agreement that
inflation risks have increased across the globe,
the causes for concern differ among various
analysts and policymakers. For some, the main
concern is that the commodity price increases
have been so broad-based, large, and rapid that
perceptions of rising inflation could spill over
into expectations for further prices increases,

demands for higher wages, and thereby an
increase in underlying inflation (second-round
effects). Others focus on the fact that, in a
number of emerging and developing economies,
the pressures from surging commodity prices
come on top of price pressures from economic
overheating. This combination exacerbates the
risks of second-round effects. The problem is
particularly acute in commodity exporters for
which the commodity price surge has been
expansionary.
A third cause for concern is that the commodity price surge might not, in fact, be a pure
supply shock but may instead be the consequence of global excess demand resulting from
overly expansionary macroeconomic policies.
As during the 1970s, soaring commodity prices
may be an early indication that capacity is being
overestimated in some countries. By mistakenly
reading the price surges as entirely the result
of sector-specific constraints, policymakers may
amplify inflation pressures.
The chapter analyzes the commodity price
boom and the implications for inflation prospects and risks. Specifically, it seeks to answer
the following questions.
• Why are commodity prices so high, and will
they stay high?
• What has been the impact of rising commodity prices on headline and core inflation
across the globe? Which countries have been
most affected? What are the risks of significant second-round effects, and what factors
affect these risks?
• What should be the appropriate monetary
policy response to rising commodity prices?
Under what circumstances can inappropriate monetary policies in individual countries
carry significant global implications?
The chapter concludes that the current
commodity price boom has, broadly speaking,
reflected the interaction of strong demand, low

inventory and spare capacity levels, slow supply
expansion in key sectors, and adverse supply
shocks. Prospects for a slowing of global growth
in 2008–09—partly in response to high commodity prices—and the resolution of weatherrelated supply constraints for key food crops
have recently caused commodity prices to ease.
However, some of the underlying forces behind
the commodity price boom are still in place,
notably strong growth in large emerging economies, low inventories, and supply constraints in
key sectors. Barring an intense global downturn,
these factors will likely limit the extent of further easing from recent price peaks and provide
for continued price volatility.
Inflation risks will likely remain elevated
for some time, even if commodity prices exert
less direct inflation pressure than during the
past year and a half, because the adjustment
to the large increase in relative commodity prices is still in train. There have already
been second-round effects in some economies,
and some others remain at risk. Emerging
and developing economies are generally more
vulnerable to the main risk factors, including
having a large share of commodities in final
expenditure and having less-credible monetary
management. Moreover, higher international
prices, in ­particular for fuels, have not yet been
fully passed through to domestic prices in many
economies.
Notwithstanding the recent easing in commodity prices, a determined monetary policy
response remains important in economies
where inflation pressures were already elevated
before the commodity price surge and where
risks of second-round effects are high. Delaying the monetary policy response could lower
the credibility of policymakers and thereby
significantly worsen the inflation-output tradeoff. Other macroeconomic policies should
be supportive, particularly if exchange-raterelated constraints limit the scope for monetary
tightening.
The chapter is organized as follows. The next
section examines the origins of and prospects
for high commodity prices. The following sec-

84

tion looks at the relationship between commodity price shocks and inflation at the country
level, examining whether sustained increases
in food and energy prices could reverse the
recent “great moderation” in inflation across the
globe. The analysis then focuses on the monetary policy implications of the commodity price
shocks and the implications for global inflation
dynamics. The summary and conclusions section
also draws some policy implications.

Surging Commodity Prices: Origins and
Prospects
Commodity prices surged during the past year
and a half (Figure 3.1, top and middle panels). The oil price more than doubled between
December 2006 and mid-July 2008, although
some of these gains have been reversed since,
and food prices rose by more than 50 percent
during this period. These surges came on top
of large price increases during 2003–06. Overall, cumulative commodity price increases since
2003 are broadly similar in magnitude to those
recorded during the commodity price boom
of the early 1970s (1971–74), the last major
boom. More recent periods of sustained global
growth—during the 1980s and the 1990s—were
not accompanied by broad-based commodity
price booms involving fuel and food commodities. This section compares the current commodity price boom to the early 1970s boom
and then discusses current oil and food price
developments and prospects.

The Current Commodity Price Boom Compared
with the 1970s
Three common factors seem to underlie both
booms. First, the origins can be traced to strong
global growth (Figure 3.1, bottom panel).
Prices for many commodities respond strongly
Appendix 3.1 provides a more detailed overview of
recent commodity market developments and prospects.
Among others, Radetski (2006) noted that the beginning of each significant, broad commodity price boom
during the postwar period (1950–52, 1972–74, and 2003

Surging Commodity Prices: Origins and Prospects

to changes in global growth or industrial activity. This reflects the role of commodities in
global industrial activity—especially intermediate inputs in manufacturing such as metals and
agricultural raw materials, but also oil—and,
for other commodities such as food, the role of
income as a determinant of demand.
The growth acceleration in emerging and
developing economies during the past few
years—driven by industrialization takeoff and
strong per capita income increases from a
low base—has likely altered the relationship
between global activity and commodity prices
during the current boom. The rotation in
global growth toward these economies has catalyzed commodity demand because their growth
has been relatively more commodity-intensive
(Figure 3.2, top panel). The slowdown in the
advanced economies has so far had less of an
impact on commodity prices than during earlier downturns in these economies. That said,
turning points in price cycles have historically
been broadly synchronized with those in global
economic activity.
A second factor common to the 1970s boom
and the current boom is that both started with
lower-than-usual inventory and spare capacity
levels (Figure 3.2, middle and bottom panels).
In both booms, this lack of buffers amplified the
price impetus from the pickup in commodity
demand resulting from strong global growth.
The reasons for low inventory and spare capacity
levels in the current boom vary across commodity sectors, but in general, there was underinvestment and slow supply growth during the late

Figure 3.1. Commodity Prices in Historical Context
The current commodity price boom shares many common features with the most
recent major commodity price boom, during the early 1970s, including sharp
increases in oil and food prices and an environment of strong global growth .

The presence of such interaction between strong
demand and low initial buffer levels is likely one of the
factors that turn a cyclical price upswing into a price
boom, because differences in global growth between
expansions are too small to plausibly explain the large
differences in commodity prices observed during global
upswings. See, among others, Deaton and Laroque
(1992) and Radetski (2006) on the mechanics of commodity price cycles.

1990s, following two decades of low commodity
prices.
A third factor common to both booms has
been that supply constraints put upward pressure on prices. The abrupt rise in oil prices in
December 1973, together with the temporary
reduction in oil production during the embargo
by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC), has become the textbook
case of a commodity supply shock. In the current boom, weather-related crop failures, for
wheat in particular, have boosted food prices.
Such shortfalls also propelled food prices during
the earlier boom (Figure 3.3).
In the current boom, the supply-side constraints in commodity sectors other than
agriculture were not the result of sharp, temporary supply reductions, but instead reflected
protracted, inelastic supply responses in the face
of higher demand and rising prices. In the oil
market and, to a lesser extent, in some metals
markets, “time-to-build” lags appear to have
increased during the current cycle, as discussed
below. In the face of rapidly growing demand,
this slow capacity expansion has led to a perpetuation of low inventory and spare capacity levels, which have sustained the pressure on prices.
This feature of the current boom has given rise
to the notion of a “supercycle” in commodity
prices—a period with secular trend increases
in commodity prices because of the need for a
substantial buildup in capacity.
Speculation—the purchase of commodities
intended for resale at a higher price rather than
for commercial use—has been widely seen as
a factor driving up commodity prices during
both booms. In the 1970s, speculative inventory holdings appear to have risen for some
See Cuddington and Jerrett (2008) for a recent
analysis. More generally, lags in the response of supply (as
well as demand) to unexpected price changes can lead to
price cycles (see, for example, Krautkraemer, 1998), with
the length and amplitude of a cycle depending on differences between long- and short-term price elasticities and
the lag structure as well as the magnitude of the initial
unexpected change.
See Harrison and Kreps (1978) or Feiger (1976) on
definitions of speculation.

Surging Commodity Prices: Origins and Prospects

commodities, notably metals (see, for example,
Cooper and others, 1975). In the current boom,
however, inventory holdings of key commodities have generally remained low or have even
declined, suggesting that prices have not been
driven up by a speculative shift toward holdings
of real assets, as in the earlier boom. Despite
recent financial innovation in commodity markets, such as indexing, which has allowed investors to benefit from rising commodity prices
without having to maintain physical inventory
holdings, there is little discernible evidence that
the buildup of related financial positions has
systematically driven either prices for individual
commodities or price formation more broadly
(Box 3.1).
Nevertheless, financial factors and sentiment do play a role in commodity price formation. Financial variables such as interest rates
affect commodity prices through their effects
on physical demand and supply. Indeed, the
recent decline in U.S. policy interest rates likely
spurred commodity demand temporarily, as
discussed below. Many commodity prices have
traditionally been more flexible than either
wages or prices for other goods, and therefore
they tend to respond faster to such monetary
policy impulses, with some scope for short-term
price overshooting. Moreover, because most
commodities are storable, they are real assets,
and their prices are thus affected not only by
current market conditions but also by future
expectations. In the short term, such expectations can be influenced by sentiment and investor behavior, which can amplify short-term price
fluctuations, as in other asset markets.
Whether the current commodity price boom
will continue depends on the extent to which
the current alignment prevails: strong demand,
low inventory and spare capacity levels, and
supply constraints. There are indications that
some elements of this constellation have started

Figure 3.3. Grain and Oil Demand, Production, and

disruptions for major crops, are aspects of both the current and the 1970s

Chapter 3   Is Inflation Back? Commodity Prices and Inflation

Box 3.1. Does Financial Investment Affect Commodity Price Behavior?
Commodities have become an alternative
asset class in recent years, with rapid growth
in both open positions at futures exchanges
and investments in commodity-indexed assets.
This financialization of commodity markets
is often thought to have affected commodity
price behavior, although views about the extent
of influence vary widely among analysts. One
perspective is that financialization of commodities is largely beneficial and improves market
efficiency and price discovery. Another view is
that recent commodity price surges are largely
driven by speculators and herd behavior among
investors looking for alternative asset classes.
This box analyzes the potential impact of
investment flows on commodity price behavior.
Specifically, it considers whether the evidence
supports the notion that speculation in commodity-related financial assets has driven the
recent commodity price booms. To shed further light, it also considers how other aspects
of price formation, such as price volatility and
comovements, have been affected by increased
financial flows.
How do financial factors affect price formation? Financial markets can affect commodity prices through two channels. First, certain
financial variables—such as exchange rates and
interest rates—can directly affect commodity
supply and demand. For example, a weakening
U.S. dollar and lower interest rates could raise
demand and reduce production of commodities, thereby exerting price pressures. Second,
transactions by financial investors, including
speculators, might influence price behavior. A
prominent controversy in this area relates to

Surging Commodity Prices: Origins and Prospects

Because the fair value of commodities is difficult to determine, the issue of whether such
behavior has driven prices away from fundamentals has been addressed through indirect
approaches. One approach is to examine
whether changes in commodity financial positions lead to commodity price changes using
time-series analysis (“Granger causality tests”).
Many recent studies in this vein, including in
the October 2008 Global Financial Stability Report
(IMF, 2008d), have not found evidence of systematic causality between positions and prices in
either direction. Indeed, the direction of financial flows is often inconsistent with the direction
of price movements. For example, while crude
oil prices rose sharply in May and June 2008,
net speculative positions declined (first figure).
A second approach is to examine whether
recent inventory behavior is consistent with the
hypothesis that the recent price trends have
been mostly driven by speculation. The basic
intuition is as follows: For speculation to have a
persistent effect on commodity prices, it must
be accompanied by increasing physical hoarding of the commodities to keep spot markets in
balance because consumption would decline
at the higher prices (see Krugman, 2008).
Available data, however, suggest that, although
inventories for some commodities increased
somewhat in recent years, inventories for other
commodities that had significant price appreciation declined or remained broadly stable
(second figure, upper panel). In particular,
although crude oil prices almost doubled
during 2007–08, crude oil inventories among
Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) member countries
remained flat during 2008. Overall, therefore,
there is little evidence of a systematic inventory
hoarding of commodities, although a caveat is
that data on commodity inventories are poor
and lack global coverage.
See also Box 5.1 of the September 2006 World
Economic Outlook or the Interim Report on Crude Oil by
the Interagency Task Force on Commodity Markets
(ITC, 2008).

A third approach to assessing the impact
of financial investment is to gauge the crosssectional relationship between price formation and investor activities before and after
the financialization of commodities. To shed
further light, this box examines the relationship between financialization and price levels
across markets. It also extends the analysis to
two other aspects of price formation:
• Volatility: The impact of speculators on
price volatility has long been a source of
controversy among economists. Some noteworthy economists—including Adam Smith,
John Stuart Mill, and Milton Friedman—have
argued that speculators provide liquidity,
facilitate price discovery, and improve intertemporal allocation of resources by buying low and
selling high, thereby stabilizing prices. Others
contend that market participants can often be
“irrational,” trading based on emotion, heuristics, and herd mentality, thereby increasing
market volatility.
• Price comovement: Another hypothesis is that
enhanced financialization of commodities can
raise the degree to which commodity prices
move together. The reason is that increased
financial flows can amplify exposure of commodities to some common financial shocks,
such as exchange rate and interest rate movements. Moreover, investors may lack familiarity
with individual commodities, thereby leading them to allocate funds to commodities as
a whole (the habitat/category theory). For
example, investors can invest in commodities
by buying a commodity index, which allocates
funds across various commodities according to
some specified weights, rather than by investing in specific commodities about which they
may lack knowledge. Moreover, financialization
of commodities can increase the correlation—
either positive or negative—between commodity prices and other asset prices, such as equity
prices, purely on account of overall financial
market conditions.

50 commodities are examined before and after
the takeoff in commodity investment. Because
the recent commodity price and investment
booms began roughly in 2003, the focus period
is January 2003–June 2008, with the control
period being July 1997–December 2002. To

distinguish the extent of financialization, commodities are divided into two groups:
• Group A: These are commodities heavily
traded in the financial markets. Specifically,
a commodity is included in Group A if it is

indices. A total Group A price index is computed based on the average weights of the
underlying four commodity indices. Also, six
individual commodities within the group are
examined in greater detail: gold, WTI crude
oil, aluminum, copper, corn, and wheat.
• Group B: This includes all the commodities
in the IMF commodity index that are not
included in Group A. In addition to the total
Group B price index calculation based on
the IMF commodity weights, six of these are
examined in greater detail: barley, coal, iron
ore, palm oil, rice, and tin.
Price Level
Prices of Group A commodities rose by less
than 6 percent between 1997 and 2002, but
they increased by about 120 percent during
2003–08. Group B prices fell by about 12 percent during the first period, but rose by almost
75 percent during the second period (first
figure, middle panel). Indeed, many commodities without significant futures markets—such
as iron ore and rice—have experienced more
price appreciation than those with sizable
futures markets, such as gold and crude oil.
Furthermore, a simple cross-sectional regression indicates an almost flat and slightly negative relationship between price changes and
changes in the speculative net long positions
during 2003 (third figure, upper panel).

The

four commodity indices examined are the S&P
Goldman Sachs Commodity index, Deutsche Bank
Commodity Index, Dow Jones–AIG Commodity Index,
and UBS Bloomberg Constant Maturity Commodity
Index. Commodities included in Group A are Brent
crude, natural gas, West Texas Intermediate (WTI)
crude, gas oil, unleaded gasoline, heating oil, aluminum, copper, gold, lead, nickel, silver, zinc, cocoa, coffee, corn, cotton, lean hogs, beef, orange juice, soybean
oil, soybeans, soybean meal, sugar, and wheat.
These include bananas, barley, coal, fish, fish meal,
groundnuts, hard logs, hard sawed wood, hides, iron
ore, lamb, olive oil, palm oil, poultry, rapeseed oil,
rice, rubber, shrimp, soft logs, soft sawed wood, sunflower oil, tea, tin, uranium, and wool.

Price Volatility
To gauge if greater financial investment
has destabilized markets by increasing price
volatility, measures of price volatility (standard
deviations) were computed for each commodity group before and after 2003 (second
figure, lower panel). The results are mixed.
First, price volatilities for most commodities
in Group A were higher after 2003, with the
­notable exception of crude oil, which has
significantly declined despite being heavily
traded. Second, volatilities for most com­
modities in Group B have also risen, despite
the fact that they are not heavily financially
traded, which suggests that the volatility
increases in Group A may reflect factors other
than the financialization of commodities.
Furthermore, a simple cross-sectional equation
is estimated by regressing return volatilities
on changes in open interests of commodity
futures during 2003–08. The results indicate a positive but weak relationship between
return volatilities and the extent of financialization, suggesting that price volatility may be
better linked to other variables, such as market
tightness, stock levels, or geopolitical risks 
(third figure, lower panel).
Price Comovement
To gauge if there has been an increase
in comovement of commodity prices and
stock prices, weekly returns of selected commodities were regressed on a constant and an
­“explanatory” variable—including a return of
another commodity within the same group,
Commission (CFTC), net noncommercial futures
positions are used as a measure of speculative positions in commodity futures markets. These positions
are defined as the net of long and short positions of
noncommercial traders.
An open interest—defined as the total number of
options and/or futures contracts that are not closed
or delivered on a particular day—is used as a proxy
for the degree of financialization.
Haigh, Hranaiova, and Overdahl (2007) also find
no evidence that increased commodity hedge fund
trading has raised price volatility.

should increase after 2003, as financialization
accelerated.
The results do suggest increasing price
comovements among some of the more financialized commodities (table). Overall, Group A
commodities demonstrate a higher comovement than those in Group B both before and
after 2003. Moreover, on average, comovement
among Group A commodities has increased to
a greater extent than among Group B commodities. Most notably, the explanatory power
of gold returns for other Group A returns has
increased significantly, rising from about 2 percent during 1997–2002 to over 20 percent during 2003–08, suggesting that gold increasingly
comoves with other commodities in Group A.
However, the explanatory power of crude oil
for other Group A commodities has declined
significantly since 2003.10 Finally, commodity
returns in both groups do not seem closely
related to stock returns in either period.11
In summary, although financialization may
have led to increases in comovement between
some commodities, particularly with respect
to gold, no apparent systematic connection is
found to either price volatility or price changes.
These findings are consistent with recent studies in the area by the CFTC and others. Thus,
there is little evidence to suggest that trading
in futures markets has driven the price run-up
or has destabilized the commodity markets during the first half of 2008.

Group B indirectly through Group A, even though
Group B commodities are not heavily traded. See,

details.

to unwind. Prospects for slowing global growth
in 2008–09, the resolution of weather-related
supply constraints for key food crops, and
increased oil supply have led to some easing
of commodity prices since mid-July. However,
inventories and spare capacity both remain
low, growth momentum in the large emerging
economies remains strong, and some supply
constraints still exist, which, barring a more
severe global downturn, will likely limit the
extent of further easing and provide for continued price volatility.
Within this general outlook, prospects vary
for individual commodities. Fundamentally,
these cross-commodity variations reflect different characteristics (such as a commodity’s
storability or its relative position in the stages of

production) and the fact that supply problems
and inventory conditions tend to be commodityspecific. The role of common factors in shortterm commodity price fluctuations is generally
limited even during booms, as reflected in the
wide differences in the magnitude and timing of
price increases (Table 3.1). Against this backdrop, the chapter now turns to developments
and prospects for the two commodity groups
that are most relevant for the global inflation
outlook: oil and food.

Will Slowing Growth Ease Oil Prices?
By mid-July 2008, oil prices had risen well
above previous highs, to some 30 percent

real terms, but have fallen since then. The
rise in oil prices since early 2007 mirrored a
­noticeable tightening in market balances in
a context of low buffer levels (low inventories, little spare capacity). OPEC production
through most of 2007 was below 2006 levels,
and non-OPEC production declined in the
second half of 2007, while global oil demand
continued to expand at a broadly unchanged
pace. When oil market capacity is so tightly
stretched, relatively small unexpected shifts in
global supply (or demand) can have large price
effects, given the generally very low short-term
price responsiveness of oil demand. During

Short-term price elasticities of oil demand are generally believed to be low. The U.S. Department of Energy
(Costello, 2006) considers them to be in the range of
0.01 to 0.04 (absolute values)—whereas income elasticities are much higher. Similarly, Hamilton (2008) reports
elasticities of 0.03 to 0.07 (absolute values), and values
ranging from 0.03 to 0.08 were reported in the September 2005 World Economic Outlook. As a result, income
effects have dominated price effects in oil demand. In
a simple demand model with exogenous supply that
ignores nonlinearities from low inventories and intertemporal considerations, such price elasticities imply that
a reduction in oil production of 0.5 million barrels a
day—roughly the amount of the reduction in non-OPEC
supply during the second half of 2007—should lead to
prices that are 10–60 percent higher (the calculations
are based on 2007 production data). If longer-term price
elasticities are higher than short-term ones, prices will
overshoot their long-term increase in response to a supply reduction.

94

the past year and a half, the price impact of
shifts in global demand has been reinforced by
the decreased pass-through to domestic prices
in emerging and developing economies, which
further reduced the already low short-term
price elasticity of global oil demand. Other
contributing factors include rising risks of supply disruptions in some major producers and
geopolitical concerns.
Growing expectations that medium-term
oi‑market conditions will remain tight were
likely an important factor in price increases
during the past year. The pace of capacity
expansion has been slow and has consistently
fallen short of expectations in recent years,
particularly outside OPEC (Figure 3.4, top
panel).10 A broad consensus has emerged that
the buildup of production capacity needed to
accommodate the anticipated robust expansion of emerging and developing economies
will remain sluggish because of cyclical,
­technological and geological, and policy
Oil consumers in many countries have been increasingly sheltered from rising world market prices. In a
sample of 43 emerging and developing economies, fewer
than half allowed full pass-through during 2007 (compared to three-quarters in 2006). See IMF (2008b).
10Capacity constraints in the downstream oil sectors,
notably in refining, have also contributed to rising oil
prices. However, the longer-term supply issues discussed
here primarily relate to upstream investment, which is
where the long-term constraints are most severe.

Surging Commodity Prices: Origins and Prospects

constraints.11 In effect, the time-to-build lags
noted above have lengthened, although the
scope to eventually achieve such a buildup
remains in place—as reflected in the broadly
constant ratio of proven oil reserves to current
production, a measure of the long-term scarcity
of oil (Figure 3.4, middle panel). Even so,
future capacity will be built at a much higher
cost than in the past, because of the sharply
rising extraction costs in marginal fields, which
have a substantial permanent component
­(Figure 3.4, bottom panel).
Even relatively small downward revisions in
the expected path of future supply expansion
caused by increased pessimism can imply large
increases in expected future prices, given the
relatively low price elasticity of oil demand
noted above.12 Such expectations of higher
prices must be reflected in higher spot prices
today. Otherwise, producers would have incentives to leave oil reserves in the ground, and
traders would have incentives to accumulate
inventories, which could be sold later at higher
prices. It is for this reason that some observers
have referred to recent oil price increases as an
“expected supply shock,” that is, a response to
tighter medium-term market conditions (see, for
example, Clarida, 2007).
What about the role of financial factors?
Speculation and commodity financial investment
are frequently mentioned as factors in recent oil
price increases. However, there is little clear evidence that these factors have any systematic price
impact. Both investment inflows into energy and
oil funds and the net futures market positions of
noncommercial investors, for example, peaked
in late 2007 and have since declined. Nevertheless, shifts in sentiment may well have some
impact on short-term price dynamics, particularly
given the lack of timely information about global
market conditions. In addition, recent financial

Figure 3.4. Oil Supply Developments
Oil production, which has consistently fallen short of expectations over the past four
years amid high production costs, has fostered concerns that tight market conditions
will last for some time, despite adequate reserve levels.

conditions likely exerted some upward pressure.
Both U.S. dollar depreciation and the decline in
real policy interest rates tend to push oil prices
upward. The effects are primarily short-term,
with scope for overshooting, but longer-term
effects are possible through the effects on physical oil demand and supply.13
Oil prices have eased recently on (1)
increased OPEC production (primarily in
Saudi Arabia); (2) data signaling a continued
decline in U.S. oil demand that seems to reflect
a growing demand response to high prices and
not just slowing income; (3) prospects for lower
growth in other major advanced economies;
and (4) less-supportive financial conditions,
given the U.S. dollar rebound. Looking ahead,
oil demand growth is likely to moderate with
the slower global growth envisaged for the
second half of 2008 and for 2009. If recent
production increases are sustained, near-term
market conditions will thus be less tight and
will support a decrease in prices below recent
peaks, with some scope for further downward
adjustment if the global downturn intensifies
or the demand response to high prices further
strengthens in advanced economies. Nevertheless, supply constraints and continued strong
growth in emerging economies are likely to
keep prices both well above pre-boom levels and
subject to continued volatility.

High Food Prices Reflect a Combination of
Permanent and Temporary Factors
The food price boom that began around mid2006 intensified during the first four months of
2008, driven largely by increases in the prices
of six key food commodities: corn, wheat, rice,
13Effective U.S. dollar depreciation can exert upward
pressure on commodity prices through a number of channels. The empirical analysis in Box 1.4 in the April 2008
World Economic Outlook suggests that a 1 percentage point
depreciation raises oil prices (in U.S. dollars) by more
than 1 percentage point. Lower short-term real interest
rates reduce inventory holding costs and could induce
shifts from money market instruments to commodities
and other higher-yielding assets. See Bordo (1980), Frankel (1986, 2006), and Akram (2008).

soybeans and related products, rapeseed oil, and
palm oil. Together, these commodities account
for over 80 percent of the rise in the IMF’s food
price index since early 2006, despite having a
weight of only 40 percent.
The decline in global inventory levels for
these food commodities over the past few
years was important in setting the stage for
the price surges. On the supply side, there was
a decline in yield growth rates after the mid1980s, ­attributable in part to declining relative
prices and low investment rates (Figure 3.5,
top panel). The high levels of protection in
agriculture in advanced economies and the bias
in public expenditures in developing economies
toward subsidies (instead of investment in agricultural infrastructure and research) contributed
to this trend.14 On the demand side, there was a
strong pickup in consumption, driven by rapid
income growth in emerging and ­developing
economies (Figure 3.5, middle panel).15
This analysis seeks to estimate the relative
roles of a number of supply and demand factors
in explaining the price increases of these six
food commodities during 2006–08 (Figure 3.5,
bottom panel). As a caveat, the exercise is based
on simple partial equilibrium analysis and does
not incorporate the price-driving effects of low
inventories. Moreover, the uncertainty involved
is considerable, given complex interactions
across markets and time.16
• Weather Shocks: A series of weather-related
supply shocks in 2006 and 2007, which occur
less frequently than once a decade on average,
severely reduced average wheat and rapeseed
yields for two years. These include drought
14In the OECD countries, progress has been slow in
reducing overall support during the past 20 years, with
the average transfer to agricultural producers as a share
of farm-gate prices falling from 37 percent to 30 percent
in 2005. See World Bank (2007).
15The composition of demand has also changed toward
protein-rich foods, feeds, and oils in line with consumption trends in developing economies.
16The methodology is described in more detail in
Appendix 3.2. Unless otherwise stated, references are to
crop years (with the 2007 crop year running from mid2007 to mid-2008).

Surging Commodity Prices: Origins and Prospects

damage, particularly to wheat crops in Australia, eastern Europe, and northern Africa,
which accounted for about 20 percent of the
increase in wheat prices since 2006.17 The
impact of weather shocks is generally temporary; indeed, the wheat area planted for the
2008 crop year has risen sharply in response
to high prices in the United States (Trostle,
2008).
• Biofuel Production: Soaring demand from
biofuel producers for corn and some vegetable oils was a second factor boosting food
prices. Biofuel production expanded rapidly
in response to rising fuel prices, as well as to
ambitious biofuel mandates, government subsidies, and tariff protection in major advanced
economies.
In particular, corn-based ethanol production soared in the United States. Almost
30 percent of the U.S. corn crop was diverted
toward the production of biofuels during
2006–07, and this share is projected to rise to
36 percent in 2008. Despite a strong production response, the additional demand
pressure is estimated to account for some
25–45 percent of the rise in international
corn prices during this period, given a range
of plausible values for the price elasticity of
demand. Looking ahead, demand pressures
from ethanol will likely continue to exert a
rising effect on food prices unless policies are
changed.
The price effect of biofuel production on
rapeseed oil—the main biodiesel feedstock
in Europe—has become less important over
time. A reduction of EU subsidies amid
a reexamination of biofuel policies and
soaring vegetable oil prices rendered many
biodiesel plants unprofitable, and demand
for rapeseed oil for biodiesel use declined
during 2007.18 ­Moreover, rapeseed oil repre17Indeed, without the bumper crops in soybeans,
wheat, and corn in 2005, the price surge might well have
occurred earlier.
18About 20 percent of global rapeseed oil demand is
currently diverted toward biodiesel production. Use of
soybean oil and palm oil for biodiesel production also

The recent price surge followed a period of declining yield growth in grains amid
sluggish investment in agriculture. Recent demand growth, mostly from emerging
economies, has shifted toward soybean oil and palm oil. In addition to biofuel
growth, the price surge reflects a confluence of factors.

2The concordance statistic measures the proportion of time that prices of two commodities are in the same phase, with a range between
0 and 100. A high value implies that their cycles are more synchronized, suggesting the two commodities are highly substitutable (Cashin,

sents only a small and declining share of the
market for edible oils.
• Pass-Through of Higher Energy Costs: A third
factor pertains to the pass-through of higher
energy costs directly to food prices, estimated
to have accounted for about 20 percent of the
rise in the prices of the six commodities. Agricultural production costs have been pushed
higher by an almost tripling of fertilizer prices
and a doubling of fuel prices since mid-2006.
This is particularly true for corn, rapeseed,
and rice, which are particularly energy-intensive crops.
• Trade Policy: More-restrictive trade policies
have been a fourth factor pushing up food
prices. Growing concerns about the domestic
impact of rising food prices led a number of
major food-exporting countries to impose
export restrictions starting in mid-2007.
The restrictions had a particularly strong
effect on rice prices—accounting for about
half of the overall price increase according
to IMF staff estimates—but they also affected
the prices of wheat and, to a lesser extent,
palm oil and soybean oil. These policies also
led to some short-term price overshooting,
as they reportedly triggered panic buying

98

and inventory hoarding.19 Many of these
­restrictions were subsequently removed, and
some countries have released stocks. The
removal of restrictions is likely to continue
with more favorable harvests for rice and
wheat.
Overall, the most important direct factor driving up food prices since 2006 has been rising
energy costs, with trade restrictions ­following
as a close second. However, the direct effects
of these factors do not account for all of
the observed increases in the prices of the
affected crops. Mutually reinforcing indirect
effects, which operate mainly through supply
and demand substitution channels, have also
contributed. Table 3.2 illustrates the spillover
effects from the price increases for corn and
rapeseed oil (which are inputs for biofuels),
using demand and supply cross-price elasticities. The results suggest that these effects are
particularly important in explaining price
increases for soybeans and related products: a

19Such effects are common when international markets
are segmented and the share of trade in total production
is small, as it is the case for rice, but they are not considered in the estimates. See FAO (2008).

Commodity Price Shocks and Inflation

1 percent increase in corn prices, all else equal,
raises soybean prices by about three-quarters of
a percent, as farmers substitute acreage from
soybeans to corn and consumers switch from
corn to soybean meal.20 If it were assumed that
the increase in corn prices was unrelated to
price rises for the other major foods, the indirect effects of higher corn prices would account
for some 60 percent of the increase in soybean
prices and about 20 percent of the increases in
rice and wheat prices.
The resolution of weather-related supply disruptions in the current crop year and removal
of export restrictions have already led to some
easing of food prices. However, the pressure
on food prices from high oil prices and further increases in biofuel production will likely
remain, limiting the extent of the easing, and
low inventories will continue to contribute to
price volatility. Indeed, because of these more
permanent factors, the duration of the present boom has already exceeded the length of
the average food price boom by 12 months
(Figure 3.6).

Commodity Price Shocks and Inflation
Can the large relative price adjustments
implied by the recent commodity price surges
be accommodated without ratcheting up
underlying inflation? The main concern is
that a lengthy period of high headline inflation following the commodity price surges may
unhinge inflation expectations.21 The broad
context for such concern is the contrast in commodity price behavior during two key episodes
in recent history. During the “great mod-

21While relative price shifts do not generally lead to
sustained changes in the overall price level, large and
persistent temporary shocks, especially to the prices of
essential commodities, may unhinge inflation expectations and spill over into underlying inflation. For a more

price changes and overall inflation, see Ball and Mankiw

eration”—the long period of low and falling
inflation rates from the 1990s until recently—
changes in commodity prices were relatively
modest and temporary, whereas during the
“great inflation”—the 1970s—these shocks were
large and persistent, as they have been in the
present period.22
Concerns about second-round effects remain
relevant despite the recent easing of international commodity prices, because domestic
price pressures will likely persist for some time
as a result of the continuing feed-through of
past commodity price increases and lingering overheating pressures in many emerging
­economies. This section examines the links
between commodity prices and inflation over
time and across a broad sample of economies.
It highlights how the risks to the inflation
outlook are linked to the credibility of monetary policy—its ability to effectively anchor
­expectations—to the magnitude and persistence of the commodity price shocks, and to
structural factors.
Turning first to current events, the dramatic
rise in headline inflation in recent months
owes much to commodity price increases over
the past year and a half, with food prices playing a particularly important role in emerging
and developing economies (Figure 3.7). In
­comparison, the contribution of energy prices
has been moderate, with stronger effects in
advanced economies. Indeed, domestic food
prices have accelerated primarily in emerging and developing economies, while energy
22There

is a growing literature on the sources of the
“great moderation.” For example, Gerlach and others
(forthcoming) attribute the “great moderation” primarily
to improved monetary policies. The role of globalization
is less clear. Falling manufactured goods prices, driven
by rapid productivity gains from integration of large
underutilized labor forces in emerging and developing economies, helped to make the process of reducing
inflation less costly than it would otherwise have been.
However, recently strong growth in demand for commodities has added to price pressures. The observed flattening of the Phillips curve (documented in Chapter 3 of
the April 2006 World Economic Outlook) may be related to
global competition but may also reflect better monetary
management.

Figure 3.8. Changes in International and Domestic
Commodity Prices and Headline Inflation
(Year-over-year changes, in percent)

Large changes in commodity prices characterized the 1970s, when inflation reigned
in advanced economies. In comparison, recent price fluctuations have been modest,
although in recent months domestic food prices have accelerated in emerging and
developing economies, and domestic energy prices have surged in advanced
economies, while inflation has picked up around the world.

prices surged mainly in advanced economies
(Figure 3.8).23 To date, however, underlying or
core inflation has remained broadly stable in
advanced economies, although it has risen significantly in the rest of the world, as discussed
in Chapter 1 (see Figure 1.3).24 Inflation expectations have also begun to mount, especially in
emerging economies, where wages have been
on the rise amid generally tight labor markets.
What factors might affect the extent of transmission, or pass-through, from international
commodity prices into domestic food and fuel
retail prices? First, because domestic prices
are denominated in local currencies, whereas
world prices are typically denominated in dollars, exchange rate movements can amplify or
mitigate the domestic impact of changes in
world prices.25 Second, many economies levy
taxes or grant subsidies on certain commodities,
especially fuels, which, again, may amplify or

23There

are substantial differences across countries
in the way food and fuel prices are treated in consumer
price indices, especially across emerging and developing
economies. The food baskets used to measure food inflation vary from country to country, with some countries
including beverages and tobacco alongside food items,
and other countries using narrower definitions including
fresh but not processed foods. The measurement issues
are even more acute in the case of fuel prices: definitions of the fuel component of the consumer price index
(CPI) range from gasoline prices to prices for household
utilities.
24Measuring core inflation is difficult. In theory, core
inflation is defined as the underlying, or persistent, part
of inflation that provides an indication of future inflation,
although precise definitions vary (see, for example, Eckstein, 1981; and Bryan and Cecchetti, 1994). In practice,
core inflation is commonly measured using the CPI that
excludes food and energy prices, or their most volatile
components, but these measures differ across countries.
The variation in measurements of core inflation tends to
be especially significant among emerging and developing
economies, for which inferences about the underlying
inflation need to be made with caution.
25De Gregorio, Landerretche, and Neilson (2007)
argue that past oil shocks were often accompanied by
depreciations that may have amplified their pass-through
into domestic prices, whereas depreciations have been
less common in the past few years, and many economies
have, in fact, experienced appreciations that may have
softened the pass-through.

102

mitigate the transmission (Box 3.2).26 Third, the
extent to which the domestic economy is integrated with international commodity markets
is important, because in more isolated markets,
domestic supply conditions may dominate the
role of world price changes (for example, for
certain crops). Fourth, the cost structure of
domestic production plays a very important role
in the extent and timing of the pass-through
to retail prices, because labor, transportation,
and retailing costs account for a large part of
the final price of many food items, especially in
advanced economies, and the costs associated
with the commodities themselves may be moderate in comparison.27
Changes in domestic prices of food and fuel
may influence overall inflation both directly
and indirectly. The direct (first-round) effects
on headline inflation are determined by the
weights of these commodities in the consumption basket. Although these effects are large in
many—especially poor—economies, they eventually dwindle once international price changes
are passed through, unless underlying, or core,
inflation is affected.28 Such indirect (secondround) effects on core inflation depend on the
26A

number of emerging and developing economies
rely on energy subsidies to limit the domestic consequences of international energy price shocks. However,
the associated fiscal costs may be large, especially at times
of significant pressures from international prices (see
IMF, 2008b). Indeed, escalating fiscal costs have recently
forced a number of countries to roll back some of these
subsidies. Furthermore, the associated fiscal expansion
and financing requirements for ensuing government
deficits may themselves lead to inflation (Sargent and
Wallace, 1985).
27Movements in domestic labor and transportation
costs may vary and may either offset or reinforce pressures from commodity price changes. For example,
labor costs in advanced economies followed a declining
trend during the past couple of decades, in part due to
increased access to the global pool of labor (see Jaumotte
and Tytell, 2007). This may have helped offset higher
energy and material costs in recent years.
28In fact, these effects are rarely immediate, because
commodity price shocks may take considerable time to
propagate through to final retail prices. For example,
Rigobon (2008) estimates that oil price shocks typically
take 9 to 12 months to pass through, and food price
shocks can take up to 30 months.

Commodity Price Shocks and Inflation

Box 3.2. Fiscal Responses to Recent Commodity Price Increases: An Assessment
The boom in prices for food and energy has
led to a wide range of fiscal responses across
the globe aimed at mitigating the domestic
impact. This box summarizes these responses
and discusses their effectiveness in alleviating
the impact of commodity price increases on the
poor and their macroeconomic implications
more broadly.
A recent IMF survey collected information
on the fiscal responses of 161 countries to international price increases (IMF, 2008b). Among
the survey’s findings were these:
• Expenditure measures are more prominent
in the case of fuels, whereas revenue measures dominate for food. More than onequarter of the surveyed countries increased
fuel subsidies, and about one-fifth reduced
fuel taxes. Fuel subsidies reached high
levels in many countries this year, exceeding
5 percent of GDP in Ecuador, Egypt, Turkmenistan, República Bolivariana de Venezuela, and Republic of Yemen. The picture is
almost the opposite for food, with more than
half the countries reducing food taxes and
less than one-fifth increasing food subsidies.
• Exporting countries have used both tax and
regulatory measures to contain increases in
domestic food prices. These measures have
included increases in export taxes, the introduction of export quotas, and even the imposition of an outright ban on certain exports.
Notably, export bans and export taxes were
imposed by key exporters of major cereals,
including Argentina, China, India, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and Vietnam. However, more
recently a few major exporters have started
to relax some export restrictions. Vietnam
and Kazakhstan recently allowed export bans
to expire on rice and wheat, respectively,
and Ukraine has increased quotas on wheat
exports.
• About a quarter of the surveyed countries
recently increased financing for more targeted transfer programs, and 15 countries

increased public sector wages and pensions
partly in response to the price increases.
The total fiscal cost of these measures has
been substantial; the median annualized
increase in fiscal cost across the surveyed
countries during 2007–08 was 0.7 percent of
GDP. For about a quarter of the countries,
the fiscal costs exceeded 1 percent of GDP,
with higher food and fuel universal subsidies
accounting for the bulk of this increase. By
2008, the combined fiscal cost of these universal
subsidies had become a major fiscal burden in
many countries, particularly for fuel subsidies.
For example, these subsidies now account for

103

Chapter 3   Is Inflation Back? Commodity Prices and Inflation

Box 3.2 (concluded)
at least 5 percent of GDP in 7 countries and at
least 2 percent in another 17 countries (figure).
These measures are adopted, in part, because
increases in the prices of food and fuel are
seen to be particularly damaging to the poor.
In general, the burden of food price increases
tends to be highly regressive, but the burden
of fuel price increases depends on the type of
fuel. Indeed, recent IMF studies found that a
doubling of rice prices results in a 12 percent
decrease in real incomes for the poorest income
quintile, compared with a 5 percent decrease for
the richest quintile. In contrast, whereas a doubling of all fuel prices results in approximately
a 10 percent decrease in income for all income
groups, the impact of increases in gasoline
prices is roughly proportional, but the impact of
increases in kerosene prices is highly regressive.
Universal price subsidies are a fiscally costly
approach to protecting the welfare of poor
households. This is because a high proportion
of the benefits from low food and fuel prices
accrue to higher-income groups, reflecting the
higher shares of these groups in total consumption. For example, IMF studies found that about
64 percent of a subsidy for rice went to the
top three income quintiles (IMF, 2008b); the

extent to which expectations of future inflation
get unhinged and higher wage demands are set
in motion.29 This is partly linked to the relative
29In

the past, the risk of a wage-price spiral was
exacerbated in many countries by wage indexation,
with wages indexed to past inflation, which introduced
an additional source of inflation persistence. However,
indexation systems have been redesigned over the past
decades, weakening the inflation effects. This said, the
role of indexation is difficult to quantity given differences in wage-setting practices across countries. In some
countries—especially where labor markets are already
tight—transfer revenue indexation can indirectly affect
wage negotiations and increase inflation risks. In addi-

104

corresponding shares for kerosene and gasoline subsidies were 55 percent and 92 percent,
respectively (Coady and others, 2006). Switching
to better-targeted mitigation measures can substantially reduce the associated costs while more
effectively assisting the most affected segments
of the population.
Furthermore, incomplete pass-through of
international to domestic commodity prices
distorts incentives for domestic consumers and
producers and ultimately reinforces global price
pressures. More specifically, reduced taxes and
increased subsidies dilute the impact of higher
international commodity prices on demand,
and the imposition of export taxes and quotas
reduces the gains to exporters from higher prices
and therefore obstructs the supply response that
would, in time, help bring prices down. The
financing requirements implied by the high fiscal
costs of subsidies will eventually either cause their
reversal or lead to higher taxes—and therefore
higher prices—for other goods and services.
They could also feed into more general inflation
pressures if the ensuing deficits are monetized
or if they cause an excessive accumulation of
government debt. For these reasons, the broadbrush fiscal intervention ongoing in a wide
range of countries is not a viable substitute for
an appropriate monetary policy response to help
maintain macroeconomic stability in the face of
commodity price fluctuations.

magnitudes of demand and supply effects associated with commodity price shifts. On the one
hand, higher food and energy prices raise costs
and may lower productivity—a negative supply
effect that puts upward pressure on inflation.
On the other hand, they may cause expenditure
switching from other goods and services—a
negative demand effect that pushes inflation
down. Although the supply effect tends to
tion, in a number of countries, public sector wages are
adjusted in response to increases in food and energy
prices, which may contribute to a wage-price spiral.

Commodity Price Shocks and Inflation

dominate, the balance between the two effects
is subject to some uncertainty, especially in net
commodity importers. In net commodity exporters, a commodity price boom typically raises
aggregate demand and intensifies inflation pressures, although exchange rate adjustments could
mitigate this effect.
What factors influence the vulnerability of
economies to inflation risks associated with
commodity price shifts? Broadly, these could
be grouped into structural and policy-related
factors. A key structural factor is the intensity
of use. Indeed, energy intensity—measured as
energy consumption per unit of real GDP—has
fallen by about 40 percent in advanced economies since the 1970s. In comparison, emerging
and especially developing economies are considerably more energy-intensive (Figure 3.9).30
The difference between these two groups is even
more dramatic when it comes to food consumption. Food represents over one-third of household consumption in emerging and developing
economies, with the share ranging from just
over 10 percent to almost 80 percent in some
developing economies. In contrast, in advanced
economies food amounts to only one-tenth of
household consumption (half of what it was in
the 1970s), and the share of raw material costs
in total costs is considerably lower.
Among the policy-related factors that affect
economies’ vulnerability to the inflationary
impact of a commodity price shock, the credibility of monetary policy stands out. The quality
of monetary management—approximated by
an index of central bank autonomy31—has
improved around the world, but it remains
lower in emerging and especially developing
economies than in advanced economies (Figure 3.10). More than 80 percent of emerging
and developing economies maintain heavily
managed exchange rate regimes, in sharp con-

Figure 3.9. The Relative Importance of Food and Energy
Although the relative economic importance of energy and food consumption has
broadly followed a declining trend, emerging and developing economies are both
more energy-intensive and more dependent on food consumption than advanced
economies.

trast to advanced economies, where exchange
rates are now overwhelmingly floating.32
Although pegged exchange rates have helped
many emerging and developing economies
anchor inflation expectations in the past, they
do constrain monetary policy responses, particularly when advanced and nonadvanced economies face very different cyclical conditions. The
dissonance between the buoyant activity levels
and easy policy stances that now characterize a
range of emerging and developing economies is
striking and reminiscent of the situation faced
by advanced economies during the great inflation of the 1970s.
To assess the potential for second-round
effects from changes in food and fuel prices and
to relate them to the structural and policy characteristics of different economies, two related
econometric exercises were conducted. The first
one links core inflation to changes in prices of
food and fuel, controlling for changes in the
output gap (the Phillips curve).33 It is based on
country-by-country estimations over a relatively
extended time period and allows a comparison between current developments and those
at the time of the great inflation in the 1970s.
The second exercise directly links changes in
expected inflation to changes in actual headline
inflation and disaggregates the latter into core
inflation and changes in domestic inflation rates
for food and fuel.34 This exercise is based on a

comparison is based on an updated classification
of exchange rate regimes of Reinhart and Rogoff (2004).
Inflexible exchange rate regimes include all de jure and

33See Blanchard and Galí (2007) for an analysis of oil
price pass-through across industrialized economies. De
Gregorio, Landerretche, and Neilson (2007) undertake a
similar study for a sample of industrial and some emerging and developing economies. Both studies find that the
pass-through from oil price changes to overall inflation
has declined over time.
34Inflation expectations are typically measured in one of
two ways. The first is based on surveys of consumers or professional forecasters, and the second is based on the difference in yields between conventional and inflation-linked
bonds (see Soderlind and Svensson, 1997; Fung, Mitnick,
and Remolona, 1999; and Shen and Corning, 2001).

panel of advanced and emerging economies and
allows a comparison of performance depending
on structural and policy characteristics of these
economies over recent years.
The first set of estimations shows that the
pass-through from international to domestic
food prices and from domestic food prices into
core inflation in emerging economies is comparable to that seen in advanced economies in the
1970s and much higher than the pass-through
observed in advanced economies more recently
(Figure 3.11).35 In emerging economies, about
one-half of the shock to domestic food prices
ultimately makes its way through to core inflation, whereas in advanced economies, less than
one-quarter passes through. These findings are
in line with the high share of food in consumption and the relative importance of material
costs in production across emerging economies
and underscore these economies’ sensitivity to
food price developments.
Turning to fuel prices, the pass-through from
international to domestic prices is substantially
lower in emerging than in advanced economies.
The pass-through from domestic prices to core
inflation has recently been markedly lower than
Both of these measures have shortcomings: survey-based
measures may reflect subjective and sometimes unfounded
perceptions about inflation, while bond-based measures
may reflect liquidity and inflation volatility premiums, as
well as institutional features of specific bond markets. In
this study, expected inflation is measured using inflation
forecasts published by Consensus Economics, because
bond-based measures are not available for a sufficiently
broad set of countries. See Goretti and Laxton (2005) and
Levin, Natalucci, and Piger (2004) for similar analyses.
35The sample consists of 25 emerging and 21 advanced
economies (9 for the 1970–95 period). In order to limit
contamination of the estimates by endogenous factors,
the pass-through from domestic commodity prices to core
inflation is estimated using only the variation in domestic
prices that is due to changes in international prices as
well as lagged effects of domestic price developments. It
must be mentioned that the estimates vary considerably
across countries, reflecting in part differences in data
quality, measurement of inflation, and sample periods,
especially across emerging economies. The estimated
pass-through captures the full long-term pass-through
and does not reflect any differences in the time path of
the inflation responses. Appendix 3.3 provides a detailed
description of this exercise.

The recent food price pass-through in emerging economies resembles that seen in
advanced economies in the 1970s, whereas the fuel price pass-through has been
markedly lower. The recent pass-through to core inflation has been moderate for
both food and fuel prices in advanced economies.

during the 1970s, when over 20 percent of the
price shock reached core inflation. The low
pass-through coefficients may reflect a combination of factors, including declining energy
intensity, widespread fuel subsidies and controls
in emerging economies, and high fuel taxes in
many advanced economies.36
The econometric analysis of the relationship
between changes in expected and actual inflation suggests that differences in structural and
policy vulnerabilities shape expectations across
economies (Figure 3.12).37 In advanced economies, expectations appear to be well anchored:
long-term inflation forecasts do not react to
actual inflation. Expectations are generally less
well anchored in emerging economies, where
expected inflation continues to be influenced
by actual inflation even at long forecast horizons. Thus, when headline inflation increases
by 1 percentage point, inflation expected in
the following year rises by nearly 0.2 percentage point on average. Even as far as six to ten
years into the future, inflation is still expected
to rise by about 0.05 percentage point. In these
economies, expectations also respond strongly
to changes in domestic food price inflation,
whereas energy price inflation does not appear
to exert significant effects, likely reflecting the
relative shares of food and energy in consumption. In economies where food accounts for a
large share of household consumption, there is
a particularly sizable increase in expected inflation in response to changes in actual headline
and food price inflation.
36In

addition, comovement between food and energy
prices could make the two effects hard to disentangle.
Indeed, energy price changes contribute significantly
to the dynamics of food prices, as pointed out in the
preceding section. Furthermore, measurement issues
in domestic food and especially fuel prices noted above
could attenuate the estimated pass-through coefficients.
37The estimations are based on a panel of semiannual
observations beginning in 2003. The sample includes 14
advanced and 21 emerging economies. In order to disentangle the effects of core inflation from those of changes
in commodity prices, only the variation in core inflation
that is not due to changes in food and fuel prices is used
in the analysis. More information on this exercise is provided in Appendix 3.3.

Monetary Policy Responses to Commodity Price Shocks

The transmission of commodity price shocks
into expected inflation appears to depend crucially on the conduct of monetary policy. Specifically, inflation targeting appears to have been
quite effective in anchoring inflation expectations: beyond the one-year horizon, expectations respond very little to changes in actual
inflation. In contrast, non-inflation-targeting
­countries—many of which formally or informally target nominal exchange rates—seem less
successful in anchoring expectations. This said,
the apparent benefits of inflation targeting may
reflect in part the general quality of domestic
monetary management in these countries and
their levels of development more broadly (but
even so, achieving the targets has recently
become more difficult).38 In addition, other
country-specific factors­—such as the extent of
labor market flexibility and the conduct of fiscal policy—may also influence the response of
expectations to actual inflation.
Will the recent food and energy price surges
lead to a sustained increase in inflation rates
across the globe? The findings of this analysis
may give reason to be optimistic, particularly
for the advanced economies and emerging
economies that have adopted inflation targeting. At the current juncture, inflation risks are
also diminished by the economic slowdown,
especially in advanced economies, although
overheating pressures linger in many emerging
and developing economies. That said, empirical relationships based on past data may not
provide reliable guidance for the future, even
if one assumes that monetary policy credibility
will continue to improve and that global integration and competition will continue to rise.
Recent commodity-market-related shocks have
been larger and more persistent than they were
over the sample period used for the estima38Inflation

targeting in emerging economies is
discussed in Chapter 4 of the September 2005 World
Economic Outlook. In a more recent study, Mishkin and
Schmidt-Hebbel (2007) suggest that inflation targeting helps countries to lower inflation, to strengthen
monetary policy and, in particular, to reduce inflationary
effects of oil price shocks.

tions, and for this reason, actual future passthrough may surprise on the upside, unless the
global slowdown intensifies.39 The risks of such
surprises are intimately linked to expectations
of future inflation and the ability of monetary
policies to anchor them effectively, as discussed
in the following section.

Monetary Policy Responses to
Commodity Price Shocks
Monetary policy mistakes can have serious
consequences in the presence of permanent
commodity price shocks, as demonstrated by
the great inflation of the 1970s in the advanced
economies. Given already increasing inflation
and easy monetary conditions, the appropriate
response at that time to the oil price shock—an
adverse supply shock—would have been to
tighten. Instead, the inflation surge was exacerbated by a continued easing of the monetary
policy stance, which further increased inflation expectations and eroded policy credibility.
Since that experience, central banks have been
very aware that monetary policy should not
accommodate second-round effects of adverse
supply shocks.40
It is well established that the appropriate response of monetary policy to supply
shocks depends on the cyclical position of an
economy and the degree of policy credibility.
For example, with a high degree of capacity
utilization and low policy credibility, dangers of
pass-through into core inflation are relatively
high. This has implications for the appropri39In addition, although the flexibility of domestic labor
markets will in all probability continue to improve, the
anti-inflationary role of the global labor market may
eventually weaken, as labor markets in emerging and
developing countries mature and their wages catch up to
advanced economy levels.
40Many economists have noted the substantial decline
in the volatility of important macroeconomic variables
since the 1980s, including, for example, Bernanke (2004)
and King (2005). Kumhof and Laxton (2007) estimate
that about one-half of the higher output variability in the
1970s and early 1980s relative to 1995–2007 can be attributed to inefficient monetary policy and one-half to larger
supply and demand shocks.

more buoyant activity than in advanced economies.

ate monetary policy responses to the recent
surges in food and energy prices. As discussed
in Chapter 1, many emerging economies have
been showing signs of overheating, along with
easing monetary conditions. Short-term nominal interest rates are below nominal income
growth—partly because expansionary U.S. monetary conditions have been imported along with
exchange rate constraints on monetary policy,
as noted above (Figure 3.13). At the same time,
monetary policy credibility in these countries is
more fragile. To bring inflation under control
and avoid a boom-bust cycle, monetary conditions will have to tighten in affected countries.
As outlined in Box 3.3, this would also have
some moderating influence on commodity
demand at the global level and on international
commodity prices.

Monetary Policy Credibility and Inflation Dynamics
Simulations based on models with endogenous credibility and capacity constraints can
provide useful guidance for using monetary
policy to respond to adverse supply shocks in
the face of different degrees of policy credibility,
different cyclical positions, and different levels
of initial inflation. The analysis is based on a
small open economy macroeconomic model in
which inflation behavior and inflation expectations depend on the credibility of monetary
policy. Credibility is determined endogenously
and depends on the evolving track record of
inflation relative to the long-run target.41 This,
in turn, affects the extent of second-round
effects of supply shocks in the model, because
the extent to which inflation shocks feed into
expectations depends on current and past inflation. With full credibility, inflation expectations
are entirely forward-looking, implying that a
permanent increase in commodity prices has
little effect on expectations. If credibility is low,
however, expectations depend mostly on cur-

41See Alichi and others (forthcoming) for a description
of the model and its properties.

Monetary Policy Responses to Commodity Price Shocks

rent and past inflation, and they are affected by
shocks to current inflation.
The model determines the optimal monetary
policy response—through changes in the shortterm interest rate—given the central bank’s
policy objectives. These relate to deviations from
the inflation target, output gaps, and short-term
variability in interest rates.
The model postulates that the central bank
sets interest rates to minimize variability along all
three dimensions. With adverse supply shocks,
the difficulties in setting policies arise because
inflation and output initially move in opposite
directions and because monetary policy tightening reduces both output and inflation in the
short term. The central bank’s policy preferences
determine how it trades off gains from reducing
inflation against the costs of lower output.

Supply Shocks and Policy Credibility
In a first simulation, the supply shocks hit the
model economy when inflation is at the target
rate of 2 percent and the initial level of the output gap is zero.42 With high initial ­credibility—
reflecting conditions prevailing in advanced
economies—inflation rises to more than 3 percent following the inflationary supply shock
(Figure 3.14, left panels). The optimal policy
response brings inflation back to the target
within eight quarters—which is in line with conventional estimates of the lags involved in the
transmission of monetary policy. The interest
rate has to rise temporarily to a peak of about
5 percent—about 1 percentage point above the
neutral rate of 4 percent assumed in the model.
In the low-credibility case, the general picture is
roughly similar, although inflation rises by more,
and the interest rate increase required to bring
inflation back to target is proportionally higher
(Figure 3.14, right panels).

Figure 3.14. Stylized Advanced Economy with Adverse
and Favorable Supply Shocks
(Percent; quarters on the x-axis)

Adverse and favorable supply shocks are broadly symmetric in their impact on
inflation and output and monetary policy implications if credibility is high.
Adverse shock

experiments are based on supply shocks that
either permanently increase or decrease the price of
commodities. The output gap is defined so that a positive value is excess demand and associated with inflation
pressures.

Chapter 3   Is Inflation Back? Commodity Prices and Inflation

Box 3.3. Monetary Policy Regimes and Commodity Prices
Policymakers around the world have recently
shown much concern about heightened inflation pressures, with sharp spikes in oil and food
prices starting to feed into headline and even
core inflation in a large number of countries.
The question is whether monetary policy
arrangements, specifically the dollar standard
that has many countries pegging their currencies to the U.S. dollar (formally or informally
through heavily managed exchange rates) can
be held partly accountable for this development. And, if yes, what would be the impact of
adopting alternative approaches?
Under current monetary policy arrangements,
the United States exports its monetary policy
stance to a significant proportion of the global
economy, when other countries either peg their
exchange rates or intervene in foreign exchange
markets. But the world is currently facing highly
asymmetric shocks, with the United States and
the euro area being slowed by financial strains
and terms-of-trade losses and much of the rest
of the world continuing to expand at historically
high rates. A monetary policy that is appropriate for the United States, namely, relatively low
nominal and real interest rates, is therefore
highly inappropriate elsewhere.
This box seeks to answer two questions. First,
if the most significant exchange rate pegs continue for the time being, is it in the best interests of the United States to take into account
the effects of its monetary policy on the world
economy? Second, given current circumstances,
what difference would it make to the behavior
of the world economy and of individual economies if the countries that now peg to the dollar
moved to more flexible exchange rate regimes?
Monetary Policy and Core Inflation
This attempt to answer these questions
involves illustrative dynamic simulations that
use the Bank of Canada’s version of the Global
Economy Model (BoC-GEM). This is a fiveThe main authors of this box are Michael Kumhof,
Douglas Laxton, and Dirk Muir.

region dynamic stochastic general equilibrium
model that separately specifies each region’s
monetary policy regime as either a peg to the
U.S. dollar or as an inflation-targeting regime.
The latter is characterized by an interest rate
reaction function whereby nominal interest
rates are raised when inflation accelerates.
These characterizations of monetary policies are
not intended to be an accurate depiction of policies but rather a useful stylized representation
that can help shed light on the issues. A critical
feature of BoC-GEM for this investigation is its
assumption of significant nominal rigidities in
manufacturing and services but no nominal
rigidities in the oil and commodity sectors. This
implies that if monetary policy is solely concerned with domestic stabilization of price and
output volatility, it should not attempt to pursue
a strict short-run target that includes oil and
commodity inflation, but should instead focus
on stabilizing “core inflation” in the remaining
sectors, which is therefore our baseline assumption. Finally, given that reduced spare capacity
and low supply elasticities appear to have been
major factors behind the recent volatility of oil
and food prices, the model introduces factor
adjustment costs that limit the short-term supply
response in these sectors. As a result, following
a positive shock that raises global demand, there
will first be a spike in prices and only later a
significant output response.
The baseline simulation is shown as the black
lines in the figure. In the initial period, the
United States lowers its interest rate by 2.5 percentage points in response to a contractionary
The regions are United States (21.2% of world
GDP using purchasing-power-parity (PPP) weights),
emerging Asia (24.8%), commodity exporters
(15.2%), Canada (1.8%), and remaining countries
(37.0%). The simulations do not address the issue
of transitions from one monetary regime to another.
They also do not address aspects of monetary policy
other than the pure timing of interest rate changes
such as questions of portfolio preferences for reserve
assets in different currencies or questions of financial
system regulation and control of credit expansion.
The commodity sector includes but is not limited
to food production.

Monetary Policy Responses to Commodity Price Shocks

shock to consumption and investment demand
and elevated concern about financial sector
stability. This monetary intervention dampens
the effects of the demand shock, with output
falling up to 1.2 percent below potential in the
year following the shock.
At the same time, demand in emerging Asia
(EA) and a group of oil-exporting countries
(GOEC) continues to grow rapidly. Using
exchange rate pegs, these regions’ interest
rates cannot be raised in a countercyclical
fashion, and instead they fall almost one for
one with U.S. rates. Together with the highly
inflationary effects of the shocks, this leads to
sharply lower real interest rates that amplify
rather than dampen the output effects of the
shocks. GDP in these regions therefore expands
sharply, by 4.5 percent for EA and 2.8 percent
for GOEC, while inflation, both headline and
core, increases by about 4.5 and 2.0 percentage
points, respectively. This additional demand
originates in regions representing only about
20 percent of world GDP, but because growth is
very commodity-intensive in EA and GOEC, this
exerts strong upward pressure on international
oil and commodity prices, which rise by 14 percent and 5.3 percent, respectively. This in turn
accounts for the moderate increase shown in
U.S. headline inflation of 0.4 percentage point
in the initial period, despite the U.S. slowdown.
The reason is that these highly flexible prices
immediately pass through into headline inflation. Core inflation does fall with demand, but
after about a year, it picks up as some oil and
commodity inflation feeds through.
The dynamics of inflation in the baseline are
almost entirely due to the underlying demand
shocks and their amplification by monetary
policy, rather than to the initial large spikes in
oil and commodity prices that are due to supply-

Box 3.3 (concluded)
side rigidities. When the underlying shocks are
to demand, flexible commodity prices therefore
constitute a bellwether for underlying imbalances and overheating, rather than representing
a problem in and of themselves. The situation
would be very different, of course, if the underlying shocks were shocks to supply, an issue that
is not addressed here.
Should the United States Account for the Global
Impact of Its Monetary Policy?
The U.S. Federal Reserve could in principle
take account of the effects of its monetary
policy on inflation in the rest of the world. But,
because targeting a measure of overall world
inflation is not a realistic option for an institution with a mandate for domestic price and
output stability, we consider a scenario in which
the Fed, in addition to responding to domestic
core inflation, also responds to oil price inflation. The corresponding simulations are shown
as the blue lines in the figure. Monetary policy
now is much less accommodative, with nominal interest rates dropping initially by around
1.5 percentage points instead of 2.5 percentage
points. They then quickly rise to 0.3 percentage point above the neutral rate in response to
upward pressure on oil prices.
Relative to the baseline, under this policy rule,
the U.S. output gap deteriorates by 1.2 percentage points, with a cumulative 10-year difference
in output losses of 3 percent. On the other hand,
a less-accommodative U.S. monetary policy significantly mitigates the boom-and-bust cycle in EA
and GOEC, with a 1 percent reduction in excess

This requires a simulation, not shown here, that
eliminates supply-side rigidities in energy and commodities. The only major resulting difference is that
the maximum increase in real oil prices is 3.5 percent
instead of 14 percent and the maximum increase in
commodity prices is 4 percent instead of 5.3 percent.

A positive disinflationary shock has roughly
symmetric implications for the inflation rate
and for the other key variables. Thus, there is

114

demand in the first year. The impact on world
oil prices is large, with the peak increase reduced
from 14 percent to 4 percent. A U.S. focus on
oil price inflation is not only contractionary at
home, but it also induces much greater volatility
in inflation, with the benefit again accruing to
EA and GOEC, whose inflation volatility falls by
about a third. Adopting a more global measure
of inflation, while of significant benefit to EA
and GOEC, is therefore highly undesirable for
the United States. But these regions have a far
more powerful option at their disposal to help
themselves without requiring sacrifices from others—the move from fixed to flexible exchange
rates.
What Are the Benefits of Flexible Exchange
Rate Regimes?
The red lines in the figure illustrate a
scenario in which EA and GOEC also follow
an inflation-targeting regime with flexible
exchange rates, which causes them to sharply
increase nominal interest rates in response to
their demand shocks. This roughly halves the
output expansion in these regions, with inflation rates only one-quarter of their baseline values. The effect on U.S. output, through reduced
demand for U.S. exports, is less than 0.05 percent in the first year and virtually zero thereafter; the same is true for U.S. core inflation.
But initial U.S. headline inflation rises by only
half as much as under an exchange rate peg,
principally because lower demand outside the
United States causes the oil price to rise much
less strongly, by 9 percent instead of 14 percent.
This provides the answer to the second of
our questions: Under current circumstances,
flexible exchange rates would indeed make a
large difference for countries now pegging to
the dollar, with beneficial effects for output and
inflation stabilization, including the stabilization
of oil and commodity prices.

a transitory decline in inflation, which allows
the central bank to lower the interest rate
temporarily.

Monetary Policy Responses to Commodity Price Shocks

Supply Shocks and Existing Inflation Pressures
In a second simulation, the same shock hits
an economy where there are excess demand
pressures and inflation is already significantly
above target. Initial inflation is assumed to be
at 8 percent, which is above the long-run target
of 3 percent—similar to the inflation pressures from overheating faced today by some
­emerging economies. With initial inflation
above target and with low policy credibility,
an adverse supply shock will have larger  ­
second‑round effects on inflation (Figure 3.15,
right panels). As expected, an aggressive
­immediate interest rate response is needed to
bring inflation back to target, with rates rising
to 14 percent, an increase substantially larger
than the increase in inflation. Interest rates
also need to remain higher for longer, and the
negative output gap is longer-lived. Thus, even
if policy responds appropriately, an ­inflationary
supply shock in conjunction with low ­credibility
results in a period of ­stagflation. By way of
comparison, if credibility is higher, inflation can be brought back to ­target with a less
aggressive interest rate response and a lower
output cost (Figure 3.15, left panels). In contrast, in the case of a ­favorable, disinflationary
supply shock, it is optimal to reduce inflation
over a shorter time period than otherwise, as
the more rapid gains from ­credibility lower the
output costs of reducing inflation.

Supply Shocks with Delayed Monetary Policy
Responses
In a final simulation, monetary policy is
assumed to fall behind the curve. Specifically,
optimal policy is overruled for two quarters by
a decision to hold interest rates constant in the
face of an inflationary supply shock. In the case
of on-target initial inflation and high policy
credibility, the picture does not change materially from the path under the optimal responses
discussed above (Figure 3.16, left panels). The
delay does mean, however, that the interest rate
has to rise by more than otherwise. In contrast,

Figure 3.15. Stylized More-Vulnerable Emerging
Market Economy with Adverse and Favorable Supply
Shocks
(Percent; quarters on the x-axis)

The symmetry between adverse and favorable supply shocks disappears if monetary
policy credibility is low and initial inflation is already above target. A more aggressive
immediate interest rate response is needed to bring inflation back to target after an
adverse supply shock.

in the case of excessive initial inflation and low
credibility, the delay in raising interest rates
in response to an adverse supply shock causes
inflation to ratchet upward and to remain persistently higher than the long-term target. The
damage to credibility means that significantly
larger interest rate increases and a more prolonged negative output gap are needed to bring
inflation back to target.43 At the same time, the
time horizon for inflation stabilization lengthens, which increases the risks of possible future
adverse supply shocks.
If the adverse supply shock resulted in an
upward trend in commodity prices rather than
a one-time permanent increase in prices, the
monetary policy challenges associated with low
credibility and existing inflation pressures would
increase further. Simulations (not reported) that
consider a more persistent rise in commodity
prices show that such shocks would require even
more aggressive monetary policy responses. The
costs from falling behind the curve would be
even greater with such a supply shock.
To sum up, the simulation results underline the overarching importance of monetary
policy credibility. When credibility is low, the
short-run inflation-output trade-off is worse,
which implies that the policy interest rate must
increase more vigorously in response to adverse
supply shocks with second-round effects. Inappropriate actions or delays can quickly undermine credibility and make achieving price
stability more difficult.

Summary and Conclusions
The world economy has experienced the
broadest and most sustained commodity price
boom since the early 1970s. The boom has
largely been driven by the interaction of strong
global growth, a lack of sector-specific spare

43Historical

experience supports this result. For example, in the United States and Canada in the early 1980s,
short-term interest rates rose well above 20 percent, following the adoption of anti-inflation policies by the U.S.
Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada.

Summary and Conclusions

capacity and low inventories from the onset of
the boom, and slow supply responses. In addition, commodity-specific factors have contributed
to the recent surge in food prices, including
demand related to biofuel production, supply
disruptions for major crops, and trade restrictions. Cross-commodity price linkages have reinforced the price momentum, with rising energy
prices spilling into food prices. In contrast, the
increasing role of commodities as alternative
financial assets has had little, if any, discernible
systematic impact on prices, although shifts in
market sentiment can affect short-term price
dynamics, and financial variables such as interest
rates can affect prices through their effects on
physical demand and supply.
Recent developments suggest that some of the
factors driving the current boom appear to be
unwinding. Prospects of slowing global growth in
2008–09—partly in response to high commodity
prices—the resolution of weather-related supply constraints for key food crops this year, and
increased oil supply have already led to some easing of commodity prices. However, supply constraints and low inventories are likely to remain
in place for some time, and the momentum of
demand growth in large ­emerging economies
remains robust. The extent of any further easing
of prices will depend on the evolving balance
between supply factors and global growth, with
considerable scope for price volatility.
Barring a sharp drop in commodity prices,
inflation risks will remain elevated for some
time. The adjustment to the earlier commodity
price surge is still in train in many economies,
and the challenge remains to accommodate
these relative price changes without secondround effects, that is, without spillovers into
underlying inflation.
The chapter’s empirical findings on the
pass-through from food and fuel prices to core
inflation and inflation expectations suggest
that the risks of second-round effects depend
importantly on the credibility of monetary
policy and its ability to anchor expectations and
the weight of commodities—especially food—in
final expenditure. Emerging and developing

economies score lower along these dimensions,
and a number of them are thus at greater risk,
notwithstanding some offset from generally
more flexible labor markets. Such risk concerns
are corroborated by the recent increases in core
as well as headline inflation in some of these
economies. Although inflation risks are dimminishing in advanced economies owing to the
deflationary impact of the financial turmoil,
these countries may not be immune to inflation risks. Because the recent commodity price
shocks have been larger and more persistent
than they were during the period used in the
analysis, the actual pass-through may surprise
on the upside, unless the global slowdown
intensifies.
There are growing signs that monetary policy
has not yet responded adequately to the risks of
rising inflation in some emerging and developing economies. Real policy interest rates in
many of these economies are low, even in the
face of strong growth rates, recent increases in
core inflation, and relatively higher risks of second-round effects from recent commodity price
increases. In some countries, this partly reflects
exchange-rate-related constraints on monetary
policy, which resulted in some economies having imported the expansionary U.S. monetary
policy stance. In turn, monetary policies that are
insufficiently tight to contain strong domestic
demand may recently have put some additional
pressure on international commodity prices.
As the chapter’s simulation results highlight,
delays in responding to rising inflation can
erode monetary policy credibility, particularly if
inflation expectations are not well anchored—
which the chapter suggests remains the case
for many emerging economies. As a result,
more aggressive monetary policy responses may
ultimately be needed to bring inflation back to
target, at a higher cost in terms of output than
would have been involved in a timely monetary
policy response. Such dynamics are generally
reinforced by higher initial inflation levels or
inflation pressure from tightening capacity
constraints. At the same time, even with a timely
response, the time needed to reduce inflation

Appendix 3.1. Recent Commodity Market
Developments

Nese Erbil.
Commodity prices rose by 33 percent during
the first six months of 2008, led by soaring fuel
prices, before softening in the third quarter of
the year. Oil prices continued to rise rapidly
over most of this period, and they remain at
high levels by historical standards, notwithstanding some recent declines. Food prices surged in
the first quarter of 2008, led by wheat and rice,
but stabilized thereafter, as prices of these two
grains started to decline. Prices of agricultural
raw materials and beverages increased only
moderately overall, whereas base metals prices
broadly stabilized (Figure 3.17, top panel).

is likely to be longer with low policy credibility, making an economy more vulnerable to
future adverse supply shocks. This highlights
the importance of an adequate monetary policy
response to the rising inflation seen in the wake
of recent commodity price surges, especially
where current inflation is already high (“above”
target) for other reasons, notably overheating,
and where policy credibility is low.

remained at relatively low levels in the first half
of 2008. Reflecting this and the recent easing
of broad market conditions (see below), the
futures price curve moved from backwardation
in the first quarter to a very mild contango in
recent weeks, a constellation that provides incentives for further near-term inventory buildup
(Figure 3.17, third panel). Nevertheless, shifts of
the futures curve have dominated movements
along the curve in terms of magnitudes, particularly in mid-September, when broad financial
market volatility spilled into oil markets.
Diesel prices have risen much faster than gasoline prices, reflecting strong demand growth for
this product relative to global refining capacity.
Consequently, refining margins for diesel have
generally been much higher than for gasoline,
although gasoline crack spreads temporarily
shot up in mid-September on hurricane-related
temporary refining outages. Prices of other fuel
products have followed crude oil prices, albeit
with a lag (Figure 3.17, bottom panel). Coal
prices, in particular, rose by 70 percent during
the first six months of 2008, the largest increase
among all energy products. This reflected shortterm factors (such as supply disruptions early in
the year), bottlenecks in major shipping ports,
and the gradual substitution from coal in power
generation away from more expensive fuel oil.
World oil consumption moderated slightly after
seven consecutive years of rising prices, rising by
roughly 0.7 million barrels a day (mbd) during
the first half of 2008 (year over year), compared
with 1 mbd during 2005–07. Consumption in
OECD member countries declined by 1.0 mbd
during this period, primarily in the United States,
but rose by 1.5 mbd in non-OECD countries, led
by China, the Middle East, and Latin America
(Table 3.3, and Figure 3.18, top panel). Across
different products, demand for transportation
fuels (gasoline and diesel) has grown the most,
driven by increased vehicle ownership in emerging and developing economies amid continued
fuel subsidies and price controls.45 However,
45In many economies that have limited the fuel price
pass-through, the fiscal burden from fuel subsidies has

gasoline consumption in the United States fell

have increased domestic prices by about 20 percent in
response to this rising burden.

reflecting constrained incomes amid weakening
economic activity and, increasingly, a demand
response to one of the sharpest pickups in gasoline prices in recent U.S. history.
Oil production increased by 1.6 mbd during the first half of 2008, as OPEC production
increased by 1.7 mbd (year over year), partly on
account of the organization’s September 2007
decision to raise output as of November 2007.

Appendix 3.1. Recent Commodity Market Developments

Within OPEC, production increases in Saudi
Arabia (thereby risinig above the September
2007 production quota), a pickup in Iranian
exports, and production recovery in Iraq more
than offset output losses in Nigeria (from
continued attacks on production facilities) and
sluggish Venezuelan output. In contrast, nonOPEC crude oil supply fell by 0.1 mbd, reflecting mostly unexpected falls in Russian output
and field declines in the North Sea and Mexico.
In addition, liquid fuel supply has benefited
from important increases in OPEC natural gas
liquids (NGLs, not subject to quotas) and biofuels, which contributed one-quarter of the net
increase in supply during the first half of 2008
(Figure 3.18, second panel).
In the near term, oil market conditions
may ease further. On an annual basis, the
International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts
global demand growth at 0.8 mbd in 2008 and
0.7 mbd in 2009, down from 1.1 mbd in 2007.
Non-OPEC supply is expected to pick up by
1.2 mbd during the second half of 2008 (compared to the same period in the previous year),
before decreasing again gradually in 2009. The
completion of a host of new projects, particularly in Saudi Arabia, should temporarily lift
OPEC spare capacity levels. The easing may not
be long-lasting, however. In its recent MediumTerm Oil Market Report, the IEA expects OPEC
spare capacity (as a share of global consumption) to fall to below 2008 levels by 2012, as
OECD demand recovers in the outer years and
supply growth trends remain limited (partially
because of increased field decline rates).
With the moderate easing of market conditions—at least through end-2009—but with
inventories and spare capacity still low, prices
are expected to remain high, albeit below recent
peaks. Oil futures options prices suggest a much
wider range of uncertainty about price prospects than in recent years. As shown in the fan
chart (Figure 3.18, bottom panel), the 90 percent confidence interval for end-2008 oil prices
ranges from about $60 a barrel to more than
$165 a barrel, a much wider range than typically
observed.

Rising Food Prices Driven by Prices of Major Crops
Grain and vegetable oil prices picked up
sharply during the first half of 2008 amid trade
restrictions and tight supplies, leading to a
23 percent increase in the IMF’s food price
index during the first six months of 2008.
Wheat prices reached record-high nominal
levels in early March of this year following poor,
drought-related crops in 2006 and 2007 but
have declined since, as more favorable weather
conditions led to a bumper crop this year. Rice
prices began to rise in late 2007, as consumers
in developing economies switched from highpriced wheat and corn toward cheaper rice.
Price increases accelerated in early 2008, when
major exporters started to impose trade bans
(Figure 3.19, top panel).46
Corn and soybean prices have remained high
so far in 2008, with a short-lived spike in June
when floods in the U.S. Midwest (the largest
producing region in the world) led to fears of
crop damage. Other agricultural product prices
have also risen, although much more gradually,
partly because supplies and inventory levels have
so far remained more comfortable. Meat and
poultry prices have risen due to higher animal
feed costs. Food prices are expected to remain
high, given continued demand pressures, particularly for corn-based ethanol. As limited acreage
moves from corn to wheat and soybeans on the
margin in response to relative price movements,
corn production is expected to fall slightly in
2009 from 2008 (Figure 3.19, second panel).
Moreover, high oil prices will affect agricultural
production costs more broadly in the coming
years, in particular through the effect on higher
fertilizer prices.

Metal Prices Stabilized
Divergent trends in fundamentals explain
the widely varying performance of base metal
46Rice is mostly consumed domestically, and the share
of global trade to consumption is very small (with large
importers receiving the bulk of rice from only one or two
producers).

prices increased by 66 percent, and copper and
aluminum prices rebounded by 17 percent and
21 percent, respectively, but zinc and nickel
prices declined sharply. While demand for
copper and aluminum, which are more widely
traded than the other metals, has weakened,
supply in key producers (Chile, China, and
South Africa) has been adversely affected by
disruptive power shortages. In contrast, zinc
and nickel inventory levels at the London
Metals Exchange have recovered in the face of
declining demand and rising production (Figure 3.19, third panel).
Looking ahead, base metal prices should
ease in 2008 and 2009, as demand growth is
expected to weaken with slowing global industrial production and the end of the Olympic
Games construction run-up in China (Figure 3.19, bottom panel). However, continued
supply-side problems will likely provide for tight
copper and aluminum market balances for
some time.

Appendix 3.2. Accounting for Food Price
Increases, 2006–08
The main author of this appendix is Valerie MercerBlackman, with contributions from Stephen Tokarick.
This section describes the methodology used
in estimating the impact of the various demand
and supply factors on the prices of the six key
commodities discussed in the main text (as
shown in Figure 3.5, third panel). For tractability, the analysis is based on simple partial equilibrium approaches.
The amount of weather-related supply shortfalls, qish, was determined by the deviation of
global production from trend, based on annual
crop data since 1990.48 The percent change in
47Iron ore prices are determined by annual contracts
among producers and steel makers. The April 2008
increase largely reflected soaring mining costs over the
previous year and strong demand.
48Typically, shortfalls (negative deviations) were the
result of lower yields, not reductions in planted acreage,

where εim , the global import demand elasticity of commodity i, is a weighted average of
the import elasticities of demand of the main
importing countries (where wc is the import
weight of country c). This depends on the
S ) of
elasticities of demand (εDi,c ), and supply ( εi,c
country c, respectively. Mi,c is total imports, Ci,c is
total consumption, and Q i,c is total production
of the commodity i in country c.
The price impact of higher energy prices was
calculated using the contribution of fuel and
fertilizers to the production cost of each food
commodity, as reported by the U.S. Department
of Agriculture (USDA). For the 2007 and 2008
crop years, the costs were estimated based on
the IMF commodity price projections, assuming
that other costs grow at trend. The corresponding cost shares for palm oil and rapeseed oil are
based on Fedepalma (2008) and North Carolina
Solar Center (2006) estimates, respectively. The
calculations assume full pass-through of higher
costs to prices and a similar cost structure in
crop production across the globe.
The price impact of increased biofuel
demand was calculated for food items for which
more than 1 percent of the crop was used as

including for wheat and rapeseed oil, thereby corroborating the approach.

biofuel feedstock (which excluded wheat).49
The expansion of demand attributed to biofuels
is then expressed as the percentage difference
between the growth in total demand for the
crop (di) and demand growth excluding biofuels
(denoted as dib).50 The price impact (in percent) was then calculated as
%DPi = (di – dib)*(1/eiD),

(2)

where eiD is the own-price elasticity of demand
for the crop. A range of elasticity estimates from
various sources were used (Table 3.4). Moreover,
because a by-product of corn-based ethanol is
distiller’s dried grains with solubles (DDGS),
which is used for animal feed (about 30 percent
of every bushel of corn used in production),
this additional supply was deducted from the
demand for biofuel use.
To measure the impact of trade restrictions, a
slightly modified version of the trade model in
Tokarick (2003) was used. Supply and demand
are modeled as constant elasticity functions,
using elasticities from Gardiner, Roningen, and
Liu (1989). Data on commodity trade values
were taken from the UN COMTRADE database.
Production value data were estimated using

49The shares of biofuel feedstocks were calculated using
USDA data (adjusting the share of each crop used for
industrial purposes) and IEA data on biofuel production.
50This definition takes into account two competing
aspects. On the one hand, it is demand change, not
demand levels, that has the greatest impact on prices.
On the other hand, it avoids measuring the change from
such a low base (given that biofuels are a small share of
total demand), which would exaggerate the impact of
demand growth for biofuel use on price.

volume data from the USDA’s FAS database and
IMF price indices.
These direct effects, which can be considered
initial shocks, together explain about half of the
total price increase of these foods during the
period considered (2006 and 2007 crop years).
It would be impossible to account fully for the
indirect effects of the shocks. However, it is
possible to get a sense of the relative magnitude
of the cross-effects due to supply and demand
substitution and comovements. Two indicators
are considered (see Table 3.2):
• For substitution across commodities: Assuming
symmetry and no second-order effects, the
impact of a price increase in commodity j,
DPj, on commodity price i, DPi, is given by

( )

DPi
ei,j
DPj
—— = —— * —— ,

(3)

where εi,j is the cross-price elasticity of supply (demand) between commodities i and
j, and εj is the own-price elasticity of supply
(demand) of commodity j, assuming commodities i and j are substitutes in production
(consumption).
• Comovement across time: This was determined
using the concordance statistic. The statistic
was estimated for all commodity price pairs
using monthly data from January 1957 to May
2008 (starting in 1980 for rapeseed oil), using
the methodology of Cashin, McDermott,
and Scott (1999). The concordance statistic
between commodities i and j, defined as the
proportion of time two commodities are on
the same phase of the cycle, is denoted as

{

T

t=1

t=1

}

Ci,j = T –1 ∑(Si,t *Sj,t) + ∑(1 – Si,t) (1 – Sj,t) , (4)
where Si,t is a binary random variable taking
the value unity when the price of commodity
i, Pi is in a boom phase and zero when it is in
a slump phase. The same definition applies to
Sj. T is the sample size and Cij e{0,1} measures
the proportion of time the two series are in
the same phase.

124

The elasticity estimates used in the calculation are weighted, global composites of
individual country elasticities taken from
Gardiner, Roningen, and Liu (1989). Plausible
elasticity ranges for soybean oil and European rapeseed oil were also taken from the
FAPRI/GOLD model estimates in Westhoff
and Young (2000) and Arnade, Kelch, and
Leetmaa (2002). Estimates and ranges used
are shown in Table 3.4.

Appendix 3.3. Estimating Inflationary
Effects of Commodity Price Shocks
The main author of this Appendix is Irina Tytell.
This section outlines the methodology behind
the two econometric exercises discussed in the
main text and in Figures 3.11 and 3.12.

Commodity Price Pass-Through
The pass-through coefficients shown in
Figure 3.11 are obtained using quarterly data
for 25 emerging economies and 21 advanced
economies (9 for the 1970–95 period). First,
the pass-through from international to domestic prices of food and fuel is estimated using
country-by-country bivariate regressions of the
following form:
4

i=1

i=0

domestic + ∑dπ world + e .
πtdomestic = a + ∑biπt–i

(1)

In these equations π stands for the annualized quarter-over-quarter log difference (in
percent) in, respectively, food or fuel prices (the
equations also include seasonal dummies). The
reported pass-through coefficients reflect the
full long-term pass-through from international
to domestic prices:

try-specific coefficients.53 Given considerable
variation across individual—especially emerging—economies that reflects in part differences
in data quality, measurement of inflation, and
sample periods, this approach is designed to
give more weight to more precisely estimated
pass-through coefficients.

As above, π stands for the annualized quarterover-quarter log difference (in percent) in core,
food, and fuel prices, while y and y* denote the
annualized quarter-over-quarter log difference
(in percent) in, respectively, real and potential GDP (the equations also include seasonal
dummies).52 In order to limit contamination
of the estimates by endogenous factors, the
pass-through from domestic commodity prices
to core inflation is estimated using predicted
values of domestic food and fuel inflation from
the first-stage bivariate regressions. In this way,
domestic food and fuel prices reflect only the
variation that is due to changes in international
prices and lagged effects of domestic price
developments, rather than movements in labor,
transportation, and retailing costs that may have
common origins with overall inflation.
The resulting pass-through coefficients are
aggregated across countries using weighted
averages, with weights inversely proportional to
the standard errors of the corresponding coun-

Expectations and Actual Inflation
The responses of expectations to actual
inflation shown in Figure 3.12 are based on a
semiannual panel data set for 14 advanced and
21 emerging economies that covers the period
starting in 2003. The exercise links changes in
expected inflation to changes in actual headline
inflation and disaggregates the latter into core
inflation and changes in domestic inflation rates
for food and fuel:54

(4)

In these equations, Δπ denotes first differences in expected inflation at various horizons
(1, 3, 5, and 6–10 years ahead) and actual inflation (headline, as well as its core, food, and fuel
components) in percentage points. The data on
inflation expectations are obtained from Consensus Economics and are based on surveys of
professional forecasters published twice yearly in
March/April and September/October. To correspond to these frequencies, the data on actual
inflation refer to the first and third quarters of
each year and are measured in year-over-year
terms. To better disentangle the impact of food
and fuel from core inflation, a residual from a
regression of core on food and fuel inflation (in
first differences) is used in place of actual core
inflation. The equations also include country-

51This

approach is similar to the one used by De Gregorio, Landerretche, and Neilson (2007) to estimate passthrough from the world oil price to domestic inflation.
See also Blanchard and Galí (2007).
52Core inflation is based on the CPI excluding food
and energy prices. OECD data on potential GDP are used
for OECD countries, and the Hodrick-Prescott filtered
trend is employed to estimate potential GDP for nonOECD countries.

53In dynamic models, aggregating country-by-country
estimates is preferable to aggregating the underlying data
or using pooled panel regressions, as shown by Pesaran
and Smith (1995).
54See Goretti and Laxton (2005) and Levin, Natalucci,
and Piger (2004) for similar analyses, although without
the disaggregation of headline inflation into core, food,
and fuel components.

and year-fixed effects. The reported results
include only the coefficients that are statistically
significant at the 10 percent level.
The sample of emerging economies is further
split by the weight of food in the consumer price
index (CPI) and by the type of monetary policy
regime.55 Countries are grouped into those with
high (low) food weights if the weight of food
in their CPI is above (below) 25 percent. By
this definition, Chile, China, Colombia, Hong
Kong SAR, India, Indonesia, Peru, Romania,
Russia, Taiwan POC, Turkey, and Ukraine have
a high weight of food in the CPI; Brazil, Czech
Republic, Hungary, Korea, Mexico, Poland,
Singapore, Slovak Republic, and Thailand have
a low food weight. With respect to the type of
monetary policy regime, inflation targeters are
defined as countries that introduced this regime
prior to the beginning of the sample period and
excludes more recent inflation targeters. Therefore, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Czech Republic,
Hungary, Korea, Mexico, Peru, Poland, and
Thailand are classified as inflation targeters, whereas China, Hong Kong SAR, India,
Indonesia, Romania, Russia, Singapore, Slovak
Republic, Taiwan POC, Turkey, and Ukraine are
classified as non-inflation-targeters.

Financial Stress and Economic Downturns

This chapter examines why some episodes of financial
stress lead to economic downturns and others have
only a limited impact on the overall economy. The
analysis indicates that episodes of financial turmoil
characterized by banking sector distress are more likely
to be associated with severe and protracted downturns
than episodes of stress centered mainly in securities or
foreign exchange markets. Countries with more arm’slength financial systems seem particularly vulnerable
to sharp contractions in economic activity, because of
the greater procyclicality of leverage in their banking
systems. This chapter draws implications for economic
prospects in the United States and the euro area and
considers how policy responses could help limit the
output consequences of the current and future financial crises.

T

he financial turmoil that began in the
summer of 2007 has mutated into a
full-blown crisis, encompassing broader
securities markets and the banking
systems of several advanced economies. How will
macroeconomic activity be affected, and what
can policymakers do both to reduce the economic consequences of this crisis and to forestall
such crises in the future? Although past episodes
of stress in banking, securities, and/or foreign
exchange markets have only sometimes been
associated with economic downturns (Figure 4.1,
top panel), these downturns have tended to be
more severe (Figure 4.1, bottom panel).
An important concept in assessing the impact
of financial stress on economic activity is the
role of financial cycles, which have been a constant feature of the economic landscape despite
the evolution of financial systems through inno-

vation and regulatory changes. Financial systems
are inherently procyclical, with growth in credit,
leverage, and asset prices often reinforcing the
underlying economic dynamic—and in some
cases leading to a buildup of financial imbalances followed by a sharp correction (see Borio,
2007; Goodhart, 1996; and Minsky, 1992).
The impact of financial cycles on the real
economy remains subject to debate in both
academic and policy circles. One strand of
research emphasizes the role of the financial
accelerator in amplifying the effects of financial
cycles on the real economy through its effect
on the value of collateral and thereby on the
willingness of the financial system to provide
credit to the economy (Bernanke and Gertler,
1995; ­Bernanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist, 1999;
and Kiyotaki and Moore, 1997). In this view,
shocks that affect the creditworthiness of borrowers tend to accentuate swings in output.
Another branch of inquiry focuses on lenders’
balance sheets and the relationship between
bank capital and aggregate credit, the so-called
bank capital channel (Bernanke, Lown, and
Friedman, 1991; Kashyap and Stein, 1995; Peek
and Rosengren, 1995; and Altunbas, Gambacorta, and Marqués, 2007). When bank capital
is eroded, banks become more reluctant to
lend and may be forced to deleverage, leading to sharper economic downturns. Another
area of analysis is the extent to which the role
of the financial accelerator in the economy
varies with the type of financial system (World
Economic Outlook, ­September 2006; and Rajan
and ­Zingales, 2003). The general trend toward
greater reliance on arm’s-length financing and
less reliance on relationship-based lending may
have left economies better able to absorb financial stress, as both households and firms can
now substitute away from banks to markets (and
thus benefit from the so-called twin engines of
the financial system).

Against this background, this chapter
addresses the following questions: Why are some
periods of financial stress associated with slowdowns, or even recessions, while others appear
to have little impact on the real economy? What
role is played by the size or location of financial imbalances or the state of households’ and
firms’ balance sheets? Has financial innovation
reduced the role of banks in propagating shocks
from the financial system to the real economy?
To answer these questions, this chapter analyzes episodes of financial stress and economic
cycles in 17 advanced economies during the
past three decades. It draws lessons from these
episodes by differentiating among them on the
basis of the conditions in place at the start of
the financial stress episode, including the state
of households’ and firms’ balance sheets and
the dynamics of credit and asset prices in the
run-up to the stress episode; the type of financial stress involved (that is, whether related to
banks, securities markets, or foreign exchange
markets); and the policy responses. Taken
together, these factors provide a comprehensive window on the channels and mechanisms
through which financial stress affects economic
cycles. While establishing the causality between
financial stress and economic downturns poses
an inherently difficult challenge, the analysis in
the chapter makes an attempt to address this
issue by explicitly accounting for the effects of
the most common types of shocks studied in the
macroeconomic literature.
The key findings of this chapter are the
following:

The countries included in this study are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, ­Sweden,
Switzerland, United Kingdom, and United States.
This broader approach complements recent research
on the empirical relationship between asset prices—such
as equity and house prices and bond spreads—and the
dynamics of output during the course of the business
cycle (see Cihák and Koeva Brooks, forthcoming; and
Claessens, Kose, and Terrones, 2008) or between bank
capital, lending, and output (see Bayoumi and Melander,
2008; and Kashyap, Rajan, and Stein, 2008, in the context
of the United States).

Identifying Episodes of Financial Stress

• Episodes of financial turmoil characterized
by banking distress are more often associated
with severe and protracted downturns than
episodes of stress centered mainly in securities
or foreign exchange markets.
• The likelihood that financial stress will be
followed by a downturn appears to be associated with the extent to which house prices
and aggregate credit rise in the period before
the financial stress. Moreover, greater reliance on external financing by households and
nonfinancial firms is associated with sharper
downturns in the aftermath of financial stress.
• Countries with more-arm’s-length financial
systems appear to be vulnerable to sharper
contractions in economic activity in the wake
of banking stress, because leverage in the
banking system appears to be more procyclical in countries characterized by greater
financial innovation.
• The importance of core financial intermediaries in transmitting financial shocks to the
real economy suggests that policies that help
restore the capital base of these institutions
within a strong framework of financial stability
can help alleviate downturns.
• The patterns of asset prices and aggregate
credit in the United States during the current
episode of financial stress appear similar to
those of previous episodes that were followed by recessions. In particular, changes in
the pattern of household net borrowing—a
measure of reliance on external financing—
closely track the trajectory of past recessions.
Nonfinancial firms entered the turmoil from
a relatively strong position. Combined with
the large losses sustained by core banking
institutions, these factors suggest that the
United States continues to face considerable
recession risks, even though real interest rates
are low by the standards of financial-stressdriven recessions. In the euro area, households’ relatively strong balance sheets offer
some protection against a sharp downturn,
despite the sizable increases of asset prices
and credit ratios preceding the financial
turmoil.

The rest of the chapter is structured as follows. The next section elaborates the concept of
financial stress that is employed in this chapter,
and uses this concept to identify episodes of
financial turmoil during the past three decades.
The chapter then analyzes the behavior of
economic cycles following these financial stress
episodes. The section that follows discusses the
factors that differentiate episodes that were
associated with economic downturns from those
that were not. Following the macro-level analysis is a micro analysis, using bank-level data, of
the procyclicality of investment banks’ and commercial banks’ leverage in both arm’s-length
and relationship-based financial systems. The
chapter then focuses on six of the most wellknown episodes of banking-related financial
stress and places the current financial turmoil
in historical context. The concluding section
outlines some implications for policy.

Identifying Episodes of Financial Stress
Financial systems—both financial institutions and the channels of intermediation—have
historically been prone to periods of rapid
expansion followed by corrections. To better
understand the impact of financial cycles on
the economy, it is useful to look for previous
episodes of financial stress that share common
features with the current one.
The current episode began in early 2007 as
a generally orderly repricing of risk for assets
linked to U.S. subprime mortgages. By the
summer, it had rapidly escalated into a severe
liquidity squeeze in the banking systems in the
United States and western Europe and was causing serious dislocations in the interbank fund-

See

Kindleberger and Aliber (2005) for a history of
financial crises. A well-known exposition of this procyclical feature of financial systems is Minsky’s financial
instability hypothesis (Minsky, 1992), which posits that
financial markets encourage businesses and individuals to
take on too much risk, generating ruinous boom-and-bust
cycles.

Chapter 4   Financial Stress and Economic Downturns

ing market. The crisis mutated again more
recently, as heavy credit losses raised questions
about the capital strength of many banks. Moreover, the stress has spread across various market
segments in emerging as well as advanced
economies, with these segments marked by a
loss of liquidity, falling valuations, rising risk
aversion, and heightened volatility. Foreign
exchange markets have also been affected by
heightened uncertainty about the safety and
soundness of global financial assets and the
impact of financial stress on economic performance. Given these key features of the current
financial market turmoil, any characterization
of previous financial stress episodes should take
into account conditions in the banking sector,
the state of nonbank intermediation through
equities and bonds, and the behavior of foreign
exchange markets.
The academic literature on financial crises
has relied largely on historical narratives of
well-known systemic banking crises, when bank
capital was eroded, lending was disrupted,
and there was often the need for significant
public intervention (see, for example, Caprio
and Klingebiel, 2003). An extension of this
approach is to augment the narratives about
banking crises with narratives of currency
crises, when reserves were depleted and/or
there was a significant change in the exchange
rate mechanisms (see, for example, Kaminsky
and Reinhart, 1999; and Reinhart and Rogoff,
2008). Pure securities market stress episodes
have not been examined as comprehensively,
especially those involving multiple countries,

For

a detailed analysis of the interbank funding market in the context of the current turmoil, see Chapters 1
and 2 of the October 2008 Global Financial Stability Report
(IMF, 2008). The supply of liquid funds in the interbank
market dried up because many banks were in need of
such funds, and those with surplus funds refrained from
lending, owing to concerns about the creditworthiness of
their counterparts. This affected both commercial banks,
which rely largely on retail deposits to fund their lending
activities, and investment banks and broker-dealers, which
rely more on wholesale funding markets. Universal banks,
which combine features of both commercial and investment banks, faced similar constraints.

132

although studies for single countries are instructive (Shiller, 1999).
Although such narrative approaches to identifying financial crises provide a rich database of
episodes, they are less well suited to the purposes of this chapter for a number of reasons.
First, these are the episodes known to have
had large output consequences and/or to have
required significant public intervention. Less
attention has been given to “near misses”—episodes of financial stress with little macroeconomic impact—which could serve as useful
counterfactuals. Second, the episodes identified
are typically of considerable length and involve
stresses of varying intensity, making it difficult to identify both when the financial stress
peaked and whether there was any meaningful
causal relationship to an economic downturn.
Finally, even the most comprehensive databases
focus on banking crises and currency crises and
pay little attention to pure securities market
stresses or liquidity squeezes, such as the U.S.
stock market crash of 1987 and the collapse of
U.S. hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) in 1998. With leverage in banking systems linked to securitization, it would
seem important to simultaneously analyze the
banking and securities channels of intermediation to determine the degree of interaction
between the two.
To overcome these limitations, this chapter
identifies episodes of financial stress as extreme
values of a composite variable—the “Financial
Stress Index” (FSI)—which is built using marketbased indicators in real time and of high frequency. The FSI for each country is constructed
as an average of the following indicators:
• three banking-related variables: the “beta” of
banking sector stocks; the spread between

A

similar approach is used by Illing and Liu (2006).
beta of banking stocks is a measure of the correlation between the total returns to the banking sector stock
index and the overall stock market index. A beta greater
than 1—indicating that banking stocks move more than
proportionately against the overall stock market—suggests
that the banking sector is relatively risky. The FSI computes the betas as the coefficient on the rolling returns of
The

Identifying Episodes of Financial Stress

interbank rates and the yield on treasury
bills—the so-called TED spread, which measures the premium banks charge each other
over treasury bill rates; and the slope of the
yield curve;
• three securities-market-related variables:
corporate bond spreads, stock market returns,
and time-varying stock return volatility; and
• one foreign exchange variable: time-varying
effective exchange rate volatility.
The advantage of utilizing such an index is
the ability to more precisely date by quarter
the start, peak, and end of a financial stress
episode and thereby to calculate its duration.
Moreover, such an index facilitates the identification of four fundamental characteristics of
financial stress events: large shifts in asset prices
(stock and bond market returns); an abrupt
increase in risk/uncertainty (stock and foreign
exchange volatility); abrupt shifts in liquidity
(TED spreads); and the health of the banking
system (the beta of banking sector stocks and
the yield curve, which affects the profitability of
intermediating short-term liabilities into longterm assets). Looking at these subcomponents
can help identify which types of financial stress
episodes have been associated with larger output
consequences: banking-related, securities-market-related, currency-related, or a combination
of these.
This chapter uses financial market (assetprice-based) variables to identify periods when
the financial sector is under strain and its
ability to intermediate may be impaired. This
strategy has three major advantages over using
a quantity-based index (an approach that the
corporate finance literature might suggest).
each country’s banking sector subindex regressed on the
returns of the country’s overall stock market index. The
FSI considers the beta only during periods when returns
are negative to focus on adverse shocks to banks. Accordingly, in high-stress episodes, this indicator would reflect
an unusually large drop in banking stock prices relative
to overall market prices.
All variables are weighted by the inverse of their variance in order to reduce the impact on the overall index
of the more volatile variables. See Appendix 4.1 on the
construction of the index.

First, asset-price-based variables are easy to
monitor and compute on a comparable basis
across a large set of countries. Second, movements in broader financial asset prices can be
expected to have a greater impact on the ability
of financial firms to supply intermediation
services than on the ability of specific nonfinancial firms to fund new investment, which is
much more closely tied to developments in their
particular sector. Third, it is useful to initially
consider a broad range of financial stress events
using asset prices and then use quantity-based
variables to identify which of those financial
stress episodes are associated with a significant
economic downturn. The underlying hypothesis
is that only a subset of the universe of assetprice-based stress episodes reflects true underlying distress in the balance sheets of financial
intermediaries that have an impact on overall
economic activity by restricting the supply of
credit; others merely reflect normal market
corrections.
Using the seven variables described above,
the FSI is constructed for each of the 17 countries in the sample. Episodes of financial
stress are identified as those periods when the
index for a country is more than one standard
deviation above its trend (identified using
the Hodrick-Prescott filter), which signals
that one or more of the banking, securities,
and/or ­foreign exchange market variables
shifted abruptly.
Overall, 113 financial stress episodes during
the past 30 years were identified in the 17 countries considered in this chapter (Table 4.1). Of
these, 43 episodes were driven mainly by stress
in the banking sector (that is, the banking variables accounted for most of the FSI increase),
50 episodes reflected primarily turmoil in the
securities market, and 20 episodes reflected
primarily turmoil in the foreign exchange
market. In some cases, stresses in one segment
of the financial system eventually migrated into
the other segments. For example, in 17 of the
70 episodes that reflected stress primarily in
the securities or foreign exchange markets, the
banking variables accounted for at least one-

third of the spike in the FSI. This implies that
there are actually 60 episodes in the sample with
banking-related financial stress—episodes for
which banks were either the most or the second
most important factor, contributing at least onethird of the FSI spike.
Overall, the FSI appears to accurately capture
global financial episodes. The current financial crisis, which began in 2007, has a significant global dimension, affecting virtually all
countries in the sample (Figures 4.2 and 4.3).
Earlier episodes that simultaneously affected the
majority of countries in the sample include the
1987 stock market crash, the Nikkei/junk bond
collapse in the late 1980s, the Scandinavian
banking crises in 1990, the European exchange
rate mechanism crisis of 1992, and the collapse
of LTCM, but the current episode seems to have
the widest impact.
The FSI also accurately captures the fact
that, although the origins of the current episode were in the banking sector, by early 2008
the crisis had broadened significantly to affect

considered in this chapter show that the FSI
peaks, which correspond to periods of financial
stress, generally overlap accurately with wellknown financial stress episodes in these countries over the past three decades, including the
current episode (see Figure 4.2). Specifically,
the FSI captures over 90 percent of the banking
crises and over 80 percent of the currency crises
identified in the literature.
Given that spikes in the FSI are associated
with well-known events such as stock/bond market collapses or banking crises, could the index
simply mirror changes in other fundamentals
that can directly affect the economic cycle? Considering four types of such shocks—to oil prices,
labor productivity, fiscal policy, and monetary
policy—the evidence indicates that spikes in the
FSI are not correlated with oil, labor productivity, or macroeconomic policies (see Figure 4.3,
bottom three panels).10 There does appear to be
a greater correlation with monetary policy, but
this can be expected, given that monetary policy
(as measured by the term spread) is a subcomponent of the FSI itself, where it is included
because financial stress appears to be associated

Financial stress episodes tend to be synchronized around systemic events, as shown
by their clustering in a few peaks. Episodes of financial stress generally correspond
to cases of monetary policy shocks, but they don't correlate well with other shocks.

FSI captures 100 percent of all episodes identified
in the literature if the duration of episodes is interpreted
more broadly—that is, if the period around the peak of
financial stress is expanded by a few quarters.
10The definition of these shocks mirrors the definition
of financial stress episodes: (1) Shocks to oil prices or
labor productivity are defined as instances when changes
in these indicators are one standard deviation above
trend; (2) fiscal policy shocks, when the ratio of government net lending/borrowing to GDP is one standard
deviation above trend; and (3) monetary policy shocks,
when the inverse term spread is one standard deviation above trend. In all cases, the deviations from trend
are calculated using Hodrick-Prescott filters. Figure 4.3
reports the first principal components of these fiscal,
monetary, and labor productivity indicators across the set
of countries considered in the chapter.

Overall, the FSI appears to be a comprehensive indicator that successfully identifies the
main episodes of financial stress for the sample
of countries under consideration and provides a
sound basis for examining the macroeconomic
consequences of such stress.

Financial Stress, Economic Slowdown,
and Recession
How many of the financial stress episodes
identified using the FSI were followed by an
economic slowdown or an outright recession? How did episodes that were followed by
economic downturns differ from those that
were not?
• An episode of financial stress is followed by
an economic “slowdown” if the level of real
GDP falls below trend (identified using the
Hodrick-Prescott filter) within six quarters of
the onset of financial stress.
• An episode of financial stress is followed by
a “recession” if a peak-to-trough business
cycle, identified using the methodology
described in Harding and Pagan (2002) and
the April 2003 World ­Economic Outlook, begins
within six quarters of the onset of financial
stress.11
This chapter seeks to identify the main characteristics of financial stress episodes that were
eventually followed by economic downturns,
not to assess whether financial stress “causes”
economic downturns, in recognition of the
significant analytical and empirical challenges in
establishing causality.12 Nevertheless, the analysis
attempts to control, to some extent, for other
shocks—namely, monetary, fiscal, oil price, and

11For example, in the United States, the most recent
recession was in 2001, whereas the most recent slowdown
was when GDP fell below trend during 2007:Q4–2008:Q1.
12For example, many shocks affect both the financial
system and the economy, and although the financial
system may amplify the shocks, it would be hard to disentangle the direct effects of the shocks from the amplification effects.

labor productivity shocks—that may affect the
relationship between financial stress and economic cycles.
Based on the definitions above, of the 113
fi­nan­cial stress episodes identified here, 29 were
followed by slowdowns and 29 by recessions. The
remaining 55 episodes were not followed by an
economic downturn (Table 4.2).
The average lag between the onset of
­financial stress and the subsequent downturn
was about seven months. However, this average masks substantial variations: about half the
downturns occurred within a quarter of the
beginning of financial stress, but it took more
than a year for a downturn to materialize during one-fourth of the episodes (Figure 4.5).
Most important, the slowdowns and recessions that were preceded by financial stress
episodes were longer in duration and, partly as
a result, were more severe than those that were
not. Median cumulative output losses (relative
to trend or until recovery) were about 3 percent of GDP for slowdowns following financial
stress and about 4½ percent of GDP for recessions ­following financial stress, significantly
larger than for slowdowns and recessions that
were not preceded by financial stress (about
1½ percent and 2¼ percent, respectively) (see
Figure 4.1).

The occurrence of financial stress tends to
change the patterns of downturns (Figure 4.6),
as apparent by examining the dynamics of
selected macroeconomic variables at the beginning of the downturn.13 In particular, when
preceded by financial stress, economic slowdowns tend to be characterized by a flattening
in consumption growth, by investment that
follows a boom-and-bust cycle, by appreciable
turnarounds of current account balances, and
by falling inflation and real interest rates. The
pattern changes are more pronounced for
slowdowns and less pronounced for recessions,
perhaps suggesting that the latter may be triggered to a greater extent by the interaction of
financial stress with other shocks.

Why Are Some Financial Stress Episodes
Associated with Economic Downturns?
Only about half the episodes of financial
stress identified using the FSI were followed by
economic slowdowns or recessions. What deter-

13The charts use a window of 12 quarters and show
only “complete” episodes (episodes spanning at least 12
quarters from start to finish). Therefore, they include
only those downturns that started between 1983:Q1 and
2005:Q1.

start of a financial stress episode, but longer lags have been observed.

mines whether a financial stress episode will be
followed by a downturn? What characterizes the
stress episodes that precede the most severe and
prolonged downturns? To answer these questions, those financial stress episodes that were
followed by downturns are compared against
each other along two dimensions: (1) the characteristics of the financial stress episode itself
and, in particular, the nature of the financial
shock (whether related to the banking system,
securities market, or foreign exchange market)
and (2) the financial position of financial intermediaries, households, and firms at the beginning of the episode.

Banking system stress is associated with
larger output consequences than stress episodes related purely to the securities or foreign
exchange markets, in which the banking system
remains largely unaffected (Figure 4.7). About
60 percent of those financial stress episodes that
are followed by downturns are banking-related.
Moreover, slowdowns and recessions preceded
by banking-related stress tend to last longer and
be associated with larger average GDP losses
than those preceded by other types of financial stress or by no financial stress at all (see
Table 4.2).
Bank asset growth slows significantly when
banking-related financial stress episodes are
followed by recessions or slowdowns, compared
with financial stress episodes that are not followed by economic downturns (Figure 4.8,
top panel). In general, downturns tend to be
associated with a fall in the demand for credit,
but during slowdowns or recessions associated
with banking-related financial stress, the cost
of capital is significantly higher (Figure 4.8,
bottom panel).14 While the issue of reverse

14The

cost of capital is defined here as a weighted average of the real cost of equity, the real cost of debt, and
real lending rates, using as weights the relative shares of
equity, bonds, and loans in nonfinancial corporate liabilities. See Appendix 4.1 for details.

138

Financial Stress, Economic Slowdown, and Recession

causality between recessions and financial stress
is difficult to address empirically, suggesting
appropriate caution in interpreting these results,
these findings are consistent with the view that
a reduction in the supply of credit—the classic
credit crunch or credit squeeze—is a key factor
associating banking-related financial stress episodes with economic downturns.

Downturns with and without Financial Stress1

The occurrence of financial stress changes the patterns of economic downturns. In
particular, the shape of slowdowns seems to be affected.

Do Initial Conditions Matter?
Having examined the nature of the shocks, the
analysis now assesses whether the likelihood of
a downturn depends on initial conditions. The
evidence suggests that the credit and asset price
dynaamics and the financial position of financial
intermediaries, households, and firms preceding
the episode are important in determining the
economic impact of a financial shock.
• House prices and the credit-to-GDP ratio
both tend to rise significantly faster during
the upswing of the financial cycle in those
stress episodes that are followed by slowdowns
or recessions (Figure 4.9). Statistical tests
confirm that financial turmoil is more likely
to be followed by economic slowdown or
outright recession when it is preceded by a
more rapid buildup in house prices and credit
(Figure 4.10).
• Firms tend to be more heavily dependent
on external sources of funding—that is, with
higher net borrowing ratios—in the run-up
to financial stress episodes that are followed
by economic downturns (see Figures 4.9 and
4.10). A higher initial reliance on external
funding makes firms more vulnerable during the downswing of the financial cycle, and
may force them to adjust their spending plans
more drastically in the aftermath of financial
stress, setting the stage for a larger impact on
the real economy.
• Only financial stress episodes that are followed by recessions (not by slowdowns) seem
to be characterized by a “more exposed”
household sector in terms of reliance on
external financing (see Figure 4.9). Indeed,

(in deviation from trend) is significantly
higher at the outset of financial stress episodes that are followed by recessions than
during those that are followed by slowdowns
or by no decline in economic activity (see
Figure 4.10).
The analysis suggests that when the financial cycle turns, as signaled by the onset of
stress in financial markets, there is a greater
likelihood of a downturn in economic activity the larger the initial financial imbalances—when firms and households are more
exposed to a decline in credit and asset prices.
In particular, ­households’ exposure seems to
be associated with more severe contractions in
economic activity.
The degree to which initial financial imbalances and firms’ and households’ reliance on
external funding explain the severity of ensuing economic downturns can be investigated
more formally. The cumulative loss of output
in the aftermath of financial stress episodes is
regressed on (1) the run-up in credit and asset
prices before the onset of the financial stress,
(2) firms’ and households’ net borrowing ratios
at the start of the episodes, and (3) a proxy for
the severity of the financial shock, namely, the
duration of the stress episode.
The main results of the regressions are presented in Table 4.3:15
• Firms’ net borrowing ratio at the onset of the
financial stress episode enters significantly
in almost all specifications, confirming the
importance of the link between firms’ initial
reliance on external credit and the severity of
the decline in economic activity.
• Households’ net borrowing ratio at the onset
of the financial stress episode is statistically
significant when considered alone but loses
significance when firms’ net borrowing
position is added. It continues to affect the
severity of the output losses, however, when

15Slowdown severity is measured using the cumulative
output loss during the period during which output is
below trend; see Table 4.1 for further details. Recession
severity is measured by losses until recovery.

interacted with the duration of the financial
episode, suggesting that households’ position
matters especially when the economy is hit by
a sustained financial shock.
This chapter seeks to identify factors that
determine whether or not episodes of financial
stress are followed by economic downturns.
Therefore, a key challenge is to determine the
origins of the shocks that hit the economy and
set off the complex interactions between the
financial and real sectors. The fact that financial sector stress precedes an economic downturn does not mean that financial stress drives
subsequent real sector developments: because
financial market participants are forward-looking, financial stress may be merely a manifestation that they anticipate a fundamental
deterioration in the real sector. To address this
problem, the chapter considers four types of
shock that could be considered fundamental,
exogenous deteriorations in the real sector
environment: oil-price shock, monetary policy
shock, fiscal policy shock, and labor productivity shock. As shown in Figure 4.11, when one of
these shocks is combined with financial stress,
there is a more severe downturn than when
there is the shock alone. This suggests that
financial stress has a separately identifiable
impact.

Has Financial Innovation Affected the

Banks continue to be important in explaining why certain financial stress episodes are
associated with greater output consequences
(see Figure 4.7). Why do banks remain crucial
despite financial innovation and the emergence of nonbank sources of funding? Financial ­innovation would seem able to reduce the
pivotal role of banks by providing alternative
channels for firms and households to access
financing, channels that loosen collateral constraints for borrowers and soften the adverse
impact of financial stress on the cost of capital
for banks. However, even though the role of

banks has evolved over time, their symbiotic
relationship with securities markets remains
an essential feature of many financial systems,
especially those characterized by arm’s-length
financing (World Economic Outlook, September 2006).16 As a result, episodes of banking
distress continue to affect nonbank sources of
financing as well.
To explain the continuing importance of
banks, it is revealing to explore the procyclical behavior of bank leverage around financial
cycles. In particular, how banks manage their
leverage during upturns and downturns in the
cycle appears fundamental to explaining why
banking stress translates into a reduced credit
supply, a higher cost of capital, and a softening of economic activity. The hypothesis is as
follows: When banks overextend their balance
sheets during booms, on the back of higher
asset values and lower perceived risk, there is
a buildup of financial imbalances and a rapid
expansion in activity, which further boosts asset
values and reduces perceived risk, thereby fostering another round of lending and economic
expansion.17 Under such conditions, a financial
shock that either increases risk or reduces the
return on assets could prompt a cycle of severe
deleveraging, with banks sharply reducing their
lending (or their growth in lending) as bank
capital falls, prompting an economic slowdown
that feeds back into a further reduction in
credit supply.
The procyclicality of leverage is more pronounced when banks are more exposed to
fluctuations in the market value of assets—for
example, through their holdings of securities and

16Banks

increasingly depend on market-based funding
sources to finance their assets (such as through their
certificates of deposit and off-balance-sheet commercial
paper programs). Conversely, investment banks and
increasingly commercial banks also remain at the center
of the originate-to-distribute model of securitized financing, providing credit through repurchase facilities to
hedge funds and other leveraged intermediaries to invest
in securities markets.
17This is in line with Minsky’s financial instability
hypothesis (Minsky, 1992).

Has Financial Innovation Affected the Interplay between Financial Stress and Economic Cycles?

their repurchase facilities.18 Because this is typical
for nondepository financial intermediaries, especially investment banks, there should be evidence
of procyclical leverage among them (Shin, 2008).
On the other hand, commercial banks should be
less prone to procyclically adjusting their balance
sheets during asset price or liquidity booms and
busts, because they rely less on wholesale funding and more on retail deposits, and also because
they are less subject to mark-to-market changes in
the value of their assets.
Evidence confirms that investment banks’
leverage tends to be procyclical: they expand
their leverage when they are expanding their
assets (Figure 4.12, upper panel).19 The evidence is less uniform on the procyclicality
of commercial banks, which rely much more
on retail deposits and whose main activity is
making long-term, illiquid loans (Figure 4.12,
lower two panels). However, the evidence does
suggest that commercial banks tend to be more
procyclical when operating in more-arm’slength financial systems, where a greater share
of intermediation occurs through financial
markets rather than through traditional relationship-based (and bank-dominated) activities
(Figure 4.13). Thus, more-arm’s-length financial
systems are associated with overall more procyclical bank behavior, and as a result may be
more vulnerable to banking stress.20 Of note,
the proportion of banking-related financial
stress episodes occurring in more-arm’s-length
financial systems has remained about equal to
the proportion occurring in more-relationshipbased systems (see Table 4.1).
Indeed, slowdowns and recessions tend to be
deeper in economies with more-arm’s-length

to adjust their leverage simultaneously, because there
would be few buyers for these assets among other banks;
the only likely buyers would be cash-rich investors who do
not rely on bank leverage to fund their positions.

20This is consistent with the findings in Chapter 3 of
IMF (2008), showing that fair value accounting tends to
lead to more procyclical movements in financial intermediaries’ balance sheets.

Faster buildup in the credit ratio and house prices and higher nonfinancial corporate
borrowing are statistically significant indicators of the likelihood that financial stress
episodes will be followed by slowdowns or recessions. Household net borrowing is

downturns is broadly similar in both types of
systems (Figure 4.14), indicating that deleveraging matters and that its impact depends on the
degree of procyclicality in the banking system.21
This implies that more-arm’s-length systems are
vulnerable to sharper contractions in activity following banking stress. Consistent with this channel, the leverage of banks in more-arm’s-length
systems also tends to fall more sharply than that
of banks in other types of financial systems,
albeit from a lower starting level. This casts
doubt on the presumption that arm’s-length systems can better soften the blow from financialstress-driven economic downturns because of
21 Diverging experiences with economic cycles by
economies characterized by arm’s-length versus relationship-based financial systems may also reflect contrasts in
other areas, notably in the degree of flexibility in labor
and product markets and the types of social welfare systems (see World Economic Outlook, October 2006).

the availability of the twin engines for financial
intermediation (banks and markets).
Arm’s-length financial systems do offer several advantages over relationship-based systems
in terms of reallocating resources in response
to changing economic opportunities (see World
Economic Outlook, October 2006). However, as
the current crisis underscores, the trend toward
greater securitization in more-arm’s-length systems, while permitting portfolio diversification
to offset the costs of monitoring the idiosyncratic risks that are inherent in traditional relationship-based systems, does not eliminate the
need for banks and markets to independently
assess the risk of their exposures. Indeed, a
lack of information about the value and risk of
many securitized products, and about the losses
subsequently associated with these products,
appears to have played a significant role in
amplifying the current crisis.

The Current Financial Crisis in Historical Context

The Current Financial Crisis in Historical
Context
This section compares the current episode
of financial stress to six well-known episodes of
banking-related financial stress that occurred
in advanced economies during the 1990s. These
episodes affected Finland, Norway, Sweden, the
United Kingdom, and the United States in the
early 1990s and Japan throughout the 1990s.
Given the importance of banking distress in the
current financial turmoil, these episodes can
serve as a useful benchmark for analyzing the
current conjuncture and for gauging its potential macroeconomic impact.22
Examining the initial conditions before the
onset of these six episodes confirms the main
findings of the event analysis, namely, that
financial stress episodes are more likely to be
followed by severe economic downturns when
they occur in the context of a rapid buildup in
credit and house prices and a heavier reliance
on credit by firms and households. Broadly
speaking, the episodes characterized by the
largest asset price and credit booms were
in the Nordic countries in the early 1990s,
where increases in credit ratios, assets prices,
and bank assets were abnormally high (see
Table 4.4, top panel). At the same time, borrowing by households and firms was initially much
larger in Finland and Norway than in the other
countries. Japanese firms relied extensively on
external financing, but this was balanced at
least partially by the saving patterns of households. In contrast, before the crises in the
Anglophone countries, asset price imbalances
were moderate and balance sheets were not
under tremendous strain.
The countries with larger financial imbalances
and balance sheet vulnerabilities at the onset
of an episode experienced more severe output
contractions (see Table 4.4, lower panel). The
most dramatic collapses in asset prices, bank
asset growth, and credit occurred in the coun-

1 Oil prices are scaled by U.S. inflation (CPI). Oil-price shock is identified if oil price is
one standard deviation above Hodrick-Prescott (HP) trend.
2 Monetary policy is measured using the inverse term spread. Monetary policy shock is
identified if the inverse term spread is one standard deviation above HP trend.
3 Fiscal policy is measured using government net lending. Fiscal shock is identified if
government net lending is one standard deviation above HP trend.
4 Labor productivity of the total economy is measured as the ratio of real GDP and total
employment. Productivity shock is identified if labor productivity is one standard deviation
below HP trend. Data are not available for Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Spain, and

tries with the largest buildups of financial imbalances. These countries also suffered the deepest
and longest recessions.
Moreover, households and firms in these
countries also generally experienced a stronger
deleveraging process. Deleveraging to reduce
the stock of debt through higher savings and
consequently lower consumption and investment had direct implications for the dynamics
of growth. The degree of corporate deleveraging, in particular, corresponds remarkably well
with the length and depth of the recessions—
­underscored by the contrast between the Nordic
and Anglophone country groups.
These historical experiences underline the
key role of policy responses to financial stress.
Policies appropriate to restore sound financial
intermediation are discussed in Box 4.1, based
around four main principles. First, there must
be a sound framework in place for ensuring
financial stability, which encompasses a framework for intervention and appropriate legal,
institutional, and procedural mechanisms to
deal with distress. Second, policy responses must
be rapid and involve the early recognition of
losses, a quick assessment of the scale of the
problem, and timely measures to ensure that
financial institutions are adequately capitalized.
Third, the adverse impact of financial stress on
the real economy may need to be contained
directly, in order to preserve or restore the
health of households’ and firms’ balance sheets.
Finally, adequate safeguards must be in place
to limit the fiscal cost of support and prevent
the creation of inappropriate incentives for the
longer term that could lead to excessive reliance
on publicly financed bailouts.

Implications for the Current Crisis in the United
States and Euro Area

financial stress episodes that were followed by
recessions. The current imbalances and adjustments appear generally much smaller than those
for the six episodes examined here, except for
U.S. residential real estate investment and the
U.S. current account.23 The patterns of credit
and asset prices in the United States prior to
the current crisis are very similar to those for
the typical financial-stress-driven recession.
The deleveraging process by households in the
United States is proceeding faster than in the
typical recession, although deleveraging by firms
seems to be proceeding somewhat more slowly
and from a stronger initial position. Finally,
although bank assets remained robust during
the second half of 2007, partly reflecting the
reintermediation of off-balance-sheet commitments, the ratio of credit to GDP declined significantly in the first quarter of 2008, suggesting
that the pace of deleveraging may have picked
up (see also Chapter 1).
The current crisis is different for the United
States in important ways from previous episodes. Corporate balance sheets and firms’
reliance on external financing were on a more
solid footing entering the current crisis, which
should provide some resilience. However, the
sheer size of the U.S. mortgage market, which
is at the heart of the crisis, and the role of residential investment suggest that household saving and consumption behavior may play a much
larger role in the current downturn than in the
past. On a positive note, the policy stance in the
United States has been proactive, as exemplified
by the aggressive cuts in policy rates and the
measures taken to shore up liquidity in both
commercial banks and investment banks. Moreover, banks have raised substantial amounts of
capital, although continuing declines in the
mark-to-market value of assets suggest that
substantially more capital will be needed before
the financial system can resume significant
discretionary lending.

In the euro area, the adjustment of house
prices and credit has thus far been milder than
in the United States, but there is evidence that
the adjustment is gathering momentum. The
net borrowing pattern of firms in the euro area
is similar to that in the United States: starting
from a stronger base than typical for a financial-stress-driven recession but weakening. However, euro area households are in a considerably
stronger position, and this is a distinguishing
feature of financial stress episodes that are not
followed by recessions. The euro area’s vulnerability may also be somewhat reduced because
the financial systems in many countries tend to
be less arm’s-length than in the United States.
Within the euro area, there are important
intercountry differences. Credit growth is on a
more pronounced downward path in Ireland
and Spain than in other countries. A number
of countries have experienced unusually large
run-ups in house prices and residential investment (see Box 1.2 and Chapter 2), and activity in this sector is slowing markedly. Finally,
although Germany is experiencing large external surpluses, there are large current account
deficits in a number of countries, including
Greece, Portugal, Spain, and, to a lesser extent,
Ireland (see Box 2.1).
Overall, these results suggest that the economic impact of financial stress may be greater
in the United States than in the euro area.
The U.S. economic downturn may well become
more severe and could evolve into a recession.
The evidence for the euro area is more consistent with the pattern for a slowdown than a
recession, and the dynamics also appear to be
evolving with some lag.

Conclusions
This chapter uses the Financial Stress
Index to analyze episodes of stress in banking, securities, and foreign exchange markets
in 17 advanced economies during the past
30 years. The focus is on attempting to identify factors that determine the extent to which
financial stress affects economic activity.

The analysis finds that financial stress is
often, but not always, a precursor to economic
slowdown or recession. A rapid expansion of
credit, a run-up in house prices, and heavy
borrowing by households and firms all increase
the likelihood that stress in the financial
system will lead to a more severe economic
downturn. Banking stress, in particular, tends
to lead to greater effects on activity, despite
financial innovation that has increased the
role of securities markets in many countries.
This can be explained by the procyclicality of
leverage, especially for investment banks but
also for commercial banks in many countries.
Indeed, economies with financial systems
dominated by more-arm’s-length transactions,

as opposed to traditional relationship-based
intermediation, tend to exhibit higher procyclical leverage, indicating that the amplifying
role of financial systems in propagating shocks
is more pronounced. As a result, when shocks
affect core financial institutions, the subsequent
downturns tend to be deeper in more-arm’slength financial systems. Even so, arm’s-length
systems are not generally more prone to such
shocks, and such systems are better able to
reallocate resources across various sectors of
the economy in response to changing economic
opportunities.
Based on a comparison of the current episode of financial stress with previous episodes,
there remains a substantial likelihood of a

Box 4.1. Policies to Resolve Financial System Stress and Restore Sound Financial
Intermediation
How can policymakers respond to financial
stress, including the current global financial
turmoil, in a way that ensures that the financial
system is restored to health, while limiting the
fallout on the economy and avoiding longterm moral hazard? Well-timed interventions
aimed at financial institutions and borrowers
can help restore balance sheets and incentives,
mitigate the negative shock to the economy
of a financial system under stress, and help to
restart productive investment. But in undertaking these interventions, governments face the
key challenge of restoring financial intermediation while keeping the costs to taxpayers down,
avoiding misallocations of capital, and maintaining proper incentives.
General Principles of Intervention
The experience from past episodes of financial system distress suggests that the effectiveness and cost of policy responses depend on
four key elements:
• Having a sound framework for ensuring
financial sector stability helps prevent and
contain financial stress. Key elements of this
framework include (1) pre-crisis sanctions on
undercapitalized financial institutions that
pose systemic risks; (2) legal and institutional
mechanisms to deal swiftly with weak financial institutions, such as bank-specific bankruptcy regimes; (3) well-defined tools and
processes for closing and rapidly reopening
banks; and (4) an effective deposit insurance
system.
• Speed is of the essence to minimize the
impact on the real economy. Too often,
regulatory forbearance and liquidity support
have been used to help insolvent financial
institutions recover—only to have it become

clear later that delaying decisive intervention
increased the stress on the financial system
and the economy. To avoid this, policymakers
should force the early recognition of losses
and take steps to ensure that financial institutions are adequately capitalized.
• The adverse impact of financial system distress on the real economy may need to alleviated through measures that directly support
firms and households—for example, through
targeted debt relief programs to distressed
borrowers and corporate restructuring
programs.
• Steps should be taken to limit the costs
and moral hazard implications of these
policy responses. Shareholders must first
absorb losses by a write-down of their equity
capital. In the case of large losses, creditors
also need to contribute by reducing and
restructuring their claims. Borrowers must
absorb some of the costs, especially if they
have been imprudent. Mechanisms that link
government support (such as preferred stock
purchases) to privately raised capital can also
help identify those banks that are truly worth
saving and limit future distortions arising
from moral hazard.
Specific Policy Responses
Policymakers can employ a wide range of
specific emergency measures (aimed at containing the crisis) and restructuring tools (aimed at
restoring the normal functioning of the credit
system and rebuilding banks’ and borrowers’
balance sheets).
Emergency measures include (1) regulatory
capital forbearance, (2) emergency liquidity support, (3) government deposit guarantees, and (4) suspension of convertibility of
deposits. Each of these actions can have very

emergency measures have often included emergency
liquidity support and government deposit guarantees.

different consequences on the supply of credit
and thus on economic activity. The appropriate
policy measure depends on whether the trigger
for the crisis is a loss of depositor confidence,
the (regulatory) recognition of existing insolvency, or the knock-on effects of asset price
volatility, including exchange rate or house
price pressures. Even during the emergency
phase, however, longer-term implications must
be taken into account—the risk being that
restoring stability in the heat of the crisis may
lead central banks to extend loans to some
financial institutions that are almost certain to
prove insolvent.
Specific resolution policies include (1) recapitalizating financial institutions, (2) using asset
management companies (AMCs) to resolve
distressed loans, (3) offering debt forgiveness,
and (4) providing incentives for loan loss writeoffs. Countries typically apply a combination of
resolution strategies—with some directed more
toward financial institutions and others geared
more toward borrowers—and in the process the
government often incurs substantial fiscal costs.
Here are some experiences with these types of
resolution policies.
Recapitalization: Measures aimed at quickly
improving the capital bases of financial institutions do not directly improve debtor capacity,
but they make it easier for banks to recognize
losses and thereby facilitate corporate restructuring. Government-assisted recapitalizations
can, however, create moral hazard for shareholders, especially if government intervention

tial regulations and allowing technically insolvent
banks to continue operating—is also a rather common
response. By contrast, measures aimed at avoiding
bank runs through deposit freezes and bank holidays
are rarely used.
 Laeven and Valencia (forthcoming) show that
bank recapitalization occurred in three-quarters of the
crises they considered, with an average fiscal cost of
6 percent of GDP. AMCs were set up in slightly more
than half of the episodes in their database.
The average fiscal cost of government intervention
in the cases studied by Laeven and Valencia (forthcoming) is about 16 percent of GDP.

is small relative to the negative net worth of
recipient institutions. Looking at the recapitalization schemes adopted in the United
States (starting in 1933) and Japan (1998 and
1999) helps illustrate some key issues. In the
United States, the program mainly involved the
purchase of preferred stock to enhance bank
capital and included appropriate screening and
incentives for participants so that only banks
worth saving and those that managed their risk
and capital structure more prudently received
taxpayer funds. Moreover, banks receiving
assistance were monitored to ensure that they
made proper use of public aid. In Japan, the
first program (launched in 1998) involved only
small amounts, was mostly targeted to purchases
of subordinated debt and loans, and was broadly
spread across the banking system. A more successful recapitalization program was launched
in 1999, which involved much larger purchases
of preferred stocks, included more rigorous
benchmarks, and participation was more narrowly focused.
Asset management companies (AMCs): The main
objective of government-owned AMCs is to
accelerate financial restructuring by taking
over nonperforming assets from banks. Two
examples of successful AMCs are Securum and
Retrieva in Sweden, created in 1992 to manage
the problem loans of two major Swedish banks,
Nordbanken and Gota Bank. Both companies managed to recover much of their initial
investment by selling off their assets. Factors
that contributed to their success include an
efficient judicial system, which allowed them

The two Japanese programs together involved
public purchase of ¥10 trillion (2 percent of GDP) of
bank capital.
The specific form of bank recapitalization often
depends on the country’s insolvency regime for
financial institutions. In many countries today such
regimes do not allow for a speedy resolution of
crises but rather prolong them. Another lesson for
successful bank recapitalization is that bank capital
regulations must be enforced rigorously, which can
involve imposing limitations on the distribution of
dividends.

Conclusions

to force insolvent debtors into bankruptcy;
the real-estate-related nature of their assets,
which made it easier to restructure; and the
strong governance mechanisms and skilled
management teams in place at the companies.
However, other countries have found it harder
to realize these advantages, in part owing to
weak legal, regulatory, and political institutions—banks’ assets often are transferred to
the AMC at prices abovemarket value, resulting
in backdoor bank recapitalization and creating
moral hazard.
Debt forgiveness: Key advantages of this
measure are its simplicity and speed—debt
­forgiveness recognizes loan losses up front
and thus provides immediate relief to borrowers. At the same time, however, debt forgiveness poses incentive problems because it does
not impose losses on borrowers and bank
shareholders. It can also undermine trust in
monetary institutions and the rule of law, as
it can violate monetary standards and interfere in private contracting. Whether it works
ultimately depends on the frequency of its use
and the specific circumstances of financial

sharp downturn in the United States, given
the similarities between the current dynamics of asset prices, credit ratios, and household
financial positions and previous episodes that
were followed by recession. Mitigating factors
are the rapid monetary policy response and
a relatively low real interest rate. In the euro
area, by contrast, the relatively strong position
of households offers some protection against a
sharp downturn, despite the appreciable run-up
in asset prices and the credit ratio ahead of
the current financial turmoil. The euro area’s
vulnerability to a deeper downturn may also be
somewhat reduced because many of its financial
systems are less arm’s-length, as evidenced most
notably by the much smaller role for the originate-to-distribute mortgage banking business
model.

distress. Because of the risks of moral hazard,
however, debt forgiveness should be considered
only as a last resort.
Loan loss write-off programs: Loan loss write-off
programs are directed at supporting borrowers.
Although they can be implemented quickly,
loan loss write-offs may worsen incentives for
prudent behavior as they do not impose losses
on banks or their borrowers.
Overall, the mix of policy responses will
ultimately be crisis-specific and must reflect
a variety of factors, including the nature and
depth of the financial crisis and the specific
country circumstances. The four principles for
intervention outlined here have proven to have
general applicability and should be followed in
every crisis, including the current one.
 The U.S. experience in the 1930s, when gold payment clauses in debt contracts were abrogated, shows
that debt forgiveness can help solve coordination
problems in renegotiating debt. While few individual
creditors were willing to voluntarily remove these
clauses, when they were forced to do so collectively,
the improvement in aggregate economic circumstances left both creditors and debtors better off.

One factor that helps predict whether a
financial stress episode will lead to a downturn
is the buildup in balance sheet vulnerabilities
associated with rising asset prices and credit.
Policymakers therefore need to be alert to these
indicators during the upswing of the financial
cycle. Prudential measures and monetary policy
should be used to address buildups that may
leave the economy vulnerable to greater output
losses in the event of a severe shock.
Should significant financial stress affect the
core of the banking system, the early recognition of losses and measures to support the
speedy restoration of capital can help reduce
the output consequences. At the same time,
policymakers must seek to avoid longer-term
moral hazard implications of any strategy to
restore financial stability.

sample standard deviation. The index is then
rebased so that it ranges from 0 to 100. Finally,
it is converted into quarterly frequency by taking the average of the monthly data. The FSI is
available for 17 advanced economies starting in
1980.24
Episodes of financial stress are identified
when the index is one standard deviation above
its trend. Episodes that are only two quarters
apart are considered a single episode. To classify the cause of an episode of financial stress—
either banking-related, securities-related, or
foreign-exchange-related—we look at the
change between the FSI from the quarter prior
to the start of the episode and the maximum
value of the FSI within the episode. If most of
the increase stems from banking sector components, the FSI is classified as “banking.” The
same rule applies if the change results mainly
from the securities markets components or
the foreign exchange component. Moreover, if
banking contributes at least one-third of the
change in the FSI, the episode is also classified
as “banking-related.”

The Cost of Capital
“Cost of capital” is defined in this chapter
as a weighted average of the real cost of bank
loans, the real cost of debt, and the real cost
of equity, using as weights the relative shares
of equity, bonds, and loans in nonfinancial
corporate liabilities. The cost of capital is based
on the calculation outlined in Box 4 on p. 37
of the European Central Bank’s (ECB’s) March
2005 Monthly Bulletin. The real cost of bank
loans, real cost of debt, and real cost of equity
are derived as follows:
• Real cost of bank loans: bank lending rates
minus one-year-forward Consensus inflation
forecast. Sources: IFS, ECB, and Consensus
Economics.
24Data on long-term corporate bond yields for Greece,
Ireland, New Zealand, and Portugal were not available
and therefore were excluded from the sample.

• Real cost of debt: corporate bond yield minus
one-year-forward Consensus inflation forecast.
Sources: Thomson Datastream, Haver Analytics, and Consensus Economics.
• Real cost of equity: derived using a model
specified in Box 2 on p. 76 of the ECB’s
November 2004 Monthly Bulletin. Using available data for the other variables, the real cost
of equity, ht, can be calculated using the following equation:
Dt[(1 + g) + 8(gtIBES – g)]
Pt = ———————————,
ht – g
where
Pt = real stock price,
Dt = the current level of real dividends,
gtIBES = I/B/E/S long-term earnings-per-share
growth forecast minus Consensus longterm inflation forecast,
g = long-term growth rate of real corporate earnings, assumed constant at
2.5 percent.
The overall cost of capital is calculated as a
weighted average of these three components
with the weights defined, respectively, as loans,
debt, and equity as shares of nonfinancial corporate liabilities as reported in the OECD national
accounts data.

Bankscope Data
Two data sets were constructed using banklevel data obtained from the Bankscope
database.25 The first data set included only
investment banks as classified by the Bankscope
database (“Investment Bank/Securities House”).
The second data set, referenced in the chapter
as “commercial banks,” included banks with the
following Bankscope classifications: Commercial
Bank, Savings Bank, Cooperative Bank, Real
Estate/Mortgage Bank, and Medium & Long
Term Credit Bank.

Sample of Banks
Investment banks
The sample of banks contained banks that
were among the top 50 investment banks globally in terms of total assets in one or more years
from 1988 to 2007.

Commercial banks
The sample of banks consisted of banks that
were among the top 10 banks26 in terms of
total assets for each country in one or more
years from 1988 to 2007. Also included were
any banks that were acquired by or that merged
with a top-10 bank. (See below for an explanation of accounting for mergers and acquisition.)
The number of commercial banks in each
country used in the sample was chosen to provide a representative sample of banking activity within each country. Table 4.6 summarizes
the average yearly share of total bank assets
(as reported by the OECD) represented by the
banks in the sample.

In order to isolate as much as possible the
domestic activities of commercial banks, unconsolidated bank data were used for commercial
banks in the sample. If unconsolidated statements were unavailable, data from consolidated

addition, the data were cleaned (by country,
in the case of commercial banks) by excluding
observations in which the growth rate of total
assets was above the 95th percentile or below
the 5th percentile.

Mergers and Acquisitions
For consistency, banks that were acquired by
or merged with banks included in the original
sample set were also included in the data set.
For years prior to a merger or acquisition, the
banks involved were treated as separate banks;
for years subsequent to a merger or acquisition,
the bank resulting from the merger or acquisition was naturally a single bank in the database.
In order to calculate level changes or growth
rates of a bank in the year of a merger or acquisition, a data point was constructed for the year
prior to the merger or acquisition by summing
the data values of the banks involved in the
merger or acquisition.

Fiscal Policy as a Countercyclical Tool

This chapter investigates whether fiscal policy should
be used to combat business cycle fluctuations, especially
downturns. Can discretionary fiscal policy successfully
stimulate output? Or does it do more harm than good?
New evidence presented here, from emerging as well as
advanced economies, indicates that the effects of fiscal
stimulus can be positive, albeit modest. But policymakers must be very careful about how stimulus packages are implemented, ensuring that they are timely
and that they are not likely to become entrenched and
raise concerns about debt sustainability. The chapter
concludes with a discussion of how automatic stabilizers could be made more effective and how governance
improvements could reduce “debt bias” concerns related
to discretionary actions.

I

n recent months, as economies have been
buffeted by falling asset prices, rising costs
for raw materials and credit, and waning
confidence, there have been renewed calls
for governments to actively use fiscal policy to
support efforts taken by central banks to prevent
sharp declines in activity. Once again, there is a
lively debate about the appropriate role of fiscal
policy in managing the ­business cycle, especially
during a downturn: Are ­discretionary fiscal
actions helpful, or do they sometimes do more
harm than good? When is a discretionary package most effective? When is it better simply to
let automatic stabilizers do the job?
The debate over the appropriate role of fiscal policy in managing the business cycle has
persisted for many years. One school of thought
argues that taxes, transfers, and spending can
be used judiciously to lean against fluctuations
in economic activity, especially to the extent that

The main authors of this chapter are Alasdair Scott
(team leader), Steven Barnett, Mark De Broeck, Anna
Ivanova, Daehaeng Kim, Michael Kumhof, Douglas
Laxton, Daniel Leigh, Sven Jari Stehn, and Steven
Symansky, with support from Elaine Hensle, Annette
Kyobe, Susanna Mursula, and Ben Sutton.

economic fluctuations are mainly due to markets falling out of equilibrium instead of reacting to changes in fundamental factors such as
productivity. Others contend that fiscal policy
actions are generally either ineffective or make
things worse, because the actions are ill timed
or they create damaging distortions. This latter
point of view has dominated the debate over the
past two decades; consequently, fiscal policy has
taken a backseat to monetary policy. But there
also has been a recognition that there are times
when monetary policy needs the ­support of fiscal stimulus, such as when nominal interest rates
approach zero or the channels of monetary
policy transmission are in some way impeded.
Against this background, this chapter takes
a fresh look at the role of fiscal policy during
economic downturns. The main objectives are
to (1) analyze how fiscal policy has typically
responded during downturns; (2) examine the
effects on economic activity of fiscal stimulus
during downturns; (3) identify the main factors that affect the outcomes of fiscal policy
­interventions; and (4) offer policy suggestions,
in light of both empirical evidence and insights
from theoretical work, on (a) whether and when
to use discretionary fiscal policy, (b) the implications of using various fiscal policy ­instruments,
and (c) the appropriate balance between automatic stabilizers and discretionary actions.
This chapter seeks to contribute to the considerable literature on fiscal policy as a countercyclical tool in three ways. First, it specifically
evaluates whether discretionary fiscal policy
responses to downturns have been timely and
temporary. Second, whereas most previous
studies have focused on the effects of policy in
advanced economies, this chapter also looks

fiscal instruments and the characteristics of the
economy.
The policy record shows that discretionary
fiscal policy has been more timely than some
critiques suggest. But there are valid concerns
about whether fiscal stimulus packages will be
temporary and the implications for the path
of government debt. Empirical evidence suggests that discretionary fiscal stimulus has a
moderately positive effect on output growth
in advanced economies. However, the effects
appear to be constrained in emerging economies. This might be because of credibility
issues, especially debt concerns. Simulation
experiments show that fiscal multipliers can
vary considerably, depending on the instrument
used, the degree of monetary policy accommodation, and the type of economy. Consistent
with the empirical evidence, increases in interest
rate risk premiums as a result of debt concerns
can render fiscal multipliers negative, suggesting
that discretionary fiscal stimulus may do more
harm than good.
Does this mean there is no role for countercyclical fiscal policy? In practice, the extent of
automatic stabilizers has been related to the size
of government, but more extensive government
is generally associated with lower growth. Given
this dichotomy, it is worth investigating further
whether countercyclical fiscal rules and the fiscal
policy framework can be designed to increase
the ability of fiscal policy to smooth fluctuations in output and income over the course of
business cycles—without increasing the size of
government or placing debt stability at risk.
The chapter is organized as follows. The next
section provides a brief review of the empirical
and theoretical literature on the role of fiscal
policy in stabilizing output. The following two
sections present, first, the results of new empirical work that characterizes how fiscal policy
has been used in both advanced and emerging
economies and then an analysis of its effects.
The subsequent section uses formal simulation-based analysis to examine the effectiveness
of various stimulus options and the effects of
various macroeconomic factors when the policy

160

is implemented. The concluding section offers
some policy suggestions.

Understanding the Fiscal Policy Debate
Fiscal policy can work in two general ways to
stabilize the business cycle. One way is through
automatic stabilizers, which arise from parts of
the fiscal system that naturally vary with changes
in economic activity—for example, as output
falls, tax revenues also fall and unemployment
payments rise. Discretionary fiscal policy, on the
other hand, involves active changes in policies
that affect government expenditures, taxes, and
transfers and are often undertaken for reasons
other than stabilization.
By their nature, automatic stabilizers play an
immediate role during downturns. But they are
usually by-products of other fiscal policy objectives. As such, the size of automatic stabilizers
tends to be associated with the size of government (see, for example, Fatás and Mihov, 2001),
suggesting that an increase in the size of government can help dampen output volatility (see
Galí, 1994). However, many argue that a larger
government acts as a drag on growth over the
longer term. Hence, there is a potential conflict between increasing stability and increasing
economic efficiency. Moreover, the effectiveness
of automatic stabilizers may be more a matter of
proper design than size.
Because automatic stabilizers are often limited
in scope—Box 5.1 reviews the extent of automatic stabilizers across economies—the active
use of discretionary fiscal measures is often
promoted as a countercyclical tool. Skeptics,
however, question governments’ ability to deliver
well-timed measures as well as the macroeconomic effects of discretionary fiscal measures
and the longer-term implications for fiscal
sustainability.

Hence,

the strength of automatic stabilizers depends
on the size of transfers (such as the scope of unemployment insurance), the progressivity of the tax system, and
the effects of taxes and transfers on labor participation
and demand for workers and capital.

How important are automatic stabilizers?
This box looks at their quantitative impact
on the fiscal balance, especially in comparison with discretionary fiscal policy. First, the
impact of automatic stabilizers on the primary
balance varies across countries. The volatility in the primary balance is more a result of
changes in discretionary policy than of automatic stabilizers. However, for many countries,
changes in discretionary policy are not well
synchronized with the business cycle, suggesting that automatic stabilizers are often a more
important source of systematic countercyclical
policy actions.
Automatic stabilizers are measured using
the change in the cyclical balances estimated
in the event analysis in the main text of this
chapter. The impact of automatic stabilizers on fiscal outcomes varies across countries
and is positively related to both government
size and output volatility. Government size is a
good proxy for the size of automatic stabilizers,
and provides the horizontal axis in the first
figure. Realized volatility in the cyclical balance—­measured as the standard deviation of
the change in the cyclical balance—is roughly
equal to government size times the volatility in the output gap. The first figure shows
that even though emerging economies have
smaller governments, they tend to experience
higher volatility in the cyclical balance than
advanced ­economies. This is largely because
emerging economies have more volatile output
gaps. However, looking separately at emerging
economies and advanced economies (to control
for the higher output volatility in emerging
economies), there is a positive relationship
between government size and cyclical balance volatility—that is, countries with larger

automatic stabilizers have more variation in the
cyclical balance.
Changes in discretionary fiscal policy,
however, account for more of the volatility of
primary balances than automatic stabilizers. On
average, the volatility of the cyclically adjusted
balance is about three times greater than that
of the cyclical balance. This is true for advanced
economies and for emerging economies. But
the extent to which these policy changes play a
countercyclical role depends on how well they
are synchronized with the business cycle. To
examine this empirically, a measure of the cyclicality of fiscal policy discretion is compared with
Government size, however, is often found to
be negatively correlated with output volatility (for
example, Andrés, Doménech, and Fatás, 2008), which
would dampen the otherwise mechanical positive
relationship between government size and cyclical
balance volatility.

the size of automatic stabilizers. The second figure shows that discretionary fiscal policy tends
to be more countercyclical in advanced economies (when the countercyclicality of discretion
is greater than zero), but is often procyclical in
emerging economies (below zero). The units
on the two axes are comparable and indicate
the percentage point change in the respective
balance (after dividing by 100) for a 1 percentage point increase in the output gap. If a country lies above the 45-degree line, it indicates that
discretionary policy makes overall fiscal policy
more countercyclical than automatic stabilizers
Cyclicality of fiscal policy is measured by a regression, run in first differences, with the cyclically
adjusted primary balance as the dependent variable
and the output gap as the explanatory one. A positive
coefficient indicates a more countercyclical policy.
This regression, however, is potentially problematic in
that it ignores the relationship (endogeneity) between
fiscal policy and the output gap.

do. As can be seen, this happens in only a few
cases, including some of the Anglophone countries with smaller governments, as well as some
of the Nordic ones with larger governments.
However, there is little systematic evidence that
countries with smaller governments compensate
for weaker automatic stabilizers by using more
discretion.
Together, these findings would suggest that
(1) automatic stabilizers have, in general,
played a more consistently countercyclical role
than discretionary fiscal policy, and (2) changes
in discretionary fiscal policy are either poorly
timed or related to factors other than output
stabilization. A caveat, however, is that fiscal
policy discretion is measured by the cyclically
adjusted balance, which, as discussed in the
main text, is an imperfect proxy, because it may
also capture factors unrelated to discretionary
changes, notably asset price fluctuations.
Asset price movements directly affect
financial transaction and capital gains taxes,
but they also have broader, indirect revenue
implications, notably through a wealth effect
on consumption. To the extent that these
movements do not fully track the business
cycle (for example, amplified fluctuations relative to those of the output gap), the revenue
effects will not be captured by conventional
tax revenue elasticities and will be part of the
cyclically adjusted component of revenue. In
an unpublished study, the IMF staff prepared
econometric estimates of the short-run sensitivity of cyclically adjusted tax revenue to
house and equity price fluctuations in the G7
countries. The cyclically adjusted revenue data
are computed using the conventional adjustment methods, ensuring consistency of the
results. The estimates suggest that a 1 percent
decline in both house and equity prices could
reduce total tax revenue by up to almost 1
percent, with the house price decline accounting for most of the drop. The estimates also
indicate that Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States are more sensitive
to house and equity price fluctuations than
the continental European G7.

Understanding the Fiscal Policy Debate

These skeptics argue that discretionary fiscal
measures cannot be delivered quickly enough
by legislatures, especially compared with the
speed with which a central bank can change
its policy rate. Hence, there is a risk that fiscal
stimulus will arrive just as the economy recovers
from a downturn. Moreover, argue the critics,
fiscal stimulus measures are not likely to be well
targeted, but are likely instead to be directed
to wasteful and distortionary public spending
and revenue measures more responsive to the
pressures of interest groups than the needs of
the economy. Furthermore, they are not likely
to be withdrawn sufficiently quickly to preserve fiscal sustainability. For instance, there is
widespread evidence that fiscal policy in emerging and less developed economies is procyclical
rather than countercyclical, in part because of
political incentives to run larger deficits in good
times, when financing is available (Talvi and
Végh, 2000).
Even if fiscal stimulus can be delivered
quickly, does that justify the use of discretionary
fiscal policy? There is still considerable debate
and little theoretical consensus. A textbook
Keynesian position is that private consumption
and investment are driven by current income,
with the implication that output is highly
responsive to changes in fiscal policy. But fiscal
policy can be much less effective in an open
economy, depending on the degree of capital
mobility and the exchange rate regime, because
fiscal stimulus might simply “leak out.” In addition to the standard crowding-out arguments,
many neoclassical theorists emphasize the role
of expectations about future income and taxes,
arguing that fiscal multipliers are likely to be
small because forward-looking households will
figure out that temporary fiscal stimulus matters little to their lifetime income; multipliers
may even be negative, if increased government
expenditures lead to offsetting reductions in
private consumption and investment. By conFor

example, the well-known Ricardian equivalence
critique of Barro (1974) argues that households and
firms understand that deficits accompanied by future tax

trast, recent work using so-called New Keynesian
models argues that an increase in government
consumption still can have positive consumption and real wage effects, if there are nominal
and real rigidities and liquidity constraints (see,
for example, Galí, 2006). These models also
suggest that not all temporary fiscal measures
are ineffective: policies that affect the incentive
to switch the timing of consumption—such as
changes in consumption taxes—are likely to be
most effective when they are understood to be
temporary rather than permanent.
In recent years, four factors may have become
increasingly relevant:
• The extent of market rigidities: Rigidities in goods
and labor markets may have decreased over
time, as a result of microeconomic reforms,
and access to credit may have become more
widely available, reducing fiscal multipliers.
• The monetary policy framework: The impact of
fiscal policy can be expected to increase if it
is accommodated by monetary policy, thus
alleviating the crowding-out effect.
• Globalization and openness: To the extent that
economies are more integrated—that is, an
increasing share of domestic demand falls on
imported goods—discretionary fiscal policy
will be less effective today than previously.
• Financial innovation: Deregulation of financial markets and increased access to global
capital may have eased credit constraints on
households and firms, with the implication
that consumption and investment are less constrained by current income and less responsive to discretionary fiscal policy measures.
However, cross-border financial integration
can also reduce the sensitivity of interest rates
to government borrowing and ease crowdingout effects.
Unfortunately, empirical work has not settled
the theoretical debates. Estimates of fiscal multirises leave them no better off in net present value terms,
and therefore they save rather than spend temporary
(lump-sum) tax cuts. Neoclassical models often exhibit
negative wealth effects following increases in government spending that are strong enough to reduce private
consumption and investment.

Chapter 5   Fiscal Policy as a Countercyclical Tool

Box 5.2. Why Is It So Hard to Determine the Effects of Fiscal Stimulus?
Perhaps surprisingly, the empirical literature
on the effects of fiscal policy does not provide a
clear answer to the simple question of whether
discretionary fiscal policy can successfully
stimulate the economy during downturns. Estimates of the effects of fiscal policy on many key
macroeconomic variables can differ not merely
in degree but in sign. This box aims to show
why demonstrating conclusively what happens as
a result of discretionary fiscal policy is, in fact,
extremely difficult.
Any empirical work on this issue faces the
following problems: (1) Every assessment of
the impact of a policy change must take into
account the economic circumstances when the
policy was implemented. (2) A fiscal stimulus
can be achieved by many different combinations of taxes, transfers, and spending, each of
which can have different effects. (3) There will
sometimes be a difference between the date on
which a change in fiscal policy is measured from
the data and the date on which the policy was
common knowledge to households and firms.
(4) Policy measures and economic activity are
both endogenous—they depend on each other
at the same time—and so it is not immediately
clear what determines what just by looking
at simple correlations. This last problem is
arguably the most difficult to overcome. The
researcher must somehow strip out those parts
of changes in taxes, transfers, and spending that
occur passively (such as from automatic stabilizers) from those that represent the true policy
initiative, and use that measure of fiscal impulse
to determine the effects on economic activity.
To illustrate, suppose overall fiscal policy, g,

evolves according to
g = (a + b)y + h,

164

y = dg + ε,

(2)

where δ is the fiscal multiplier and ε represents shocks independent of policy. There are
two significant problems presented by this
system. First, we have a classic simultaneity
problem—attempting to assess the effects of
fiscal policy on output by estimating (1) will
result in biased estimates. The second problem is a ­measurement problem—the difficulty
of distinguishing systematic discretionary
policy changes from automatic stabilizers. The
elasticity-based fiscal impulse measure can be
thought of as using OECD estimates of α and
constructing

~
f = f – ay.
Estimating the cyclicality of this measure is
equivalent to estimating the parameter b.,
When examining the effectiveness of fiscal
policy in the regression framework, a fiscal
impulse measure that mistakenly includes cyclical changes generated by automatic stabilizers
will lead to invalid inferences about the effects
of discretionary fiscal policy. The second fiscal
impulse measure therefore focuses entirely
on η, the effects of unexpected fiscal policy
shocks.
Other approaches in the literature attempt
to address the same issues. Structural vector
autoregressions (SVARs) use statistical criteria
to estimate shocks to fiscal policy and measure

can think of g as representing only government

emerging economies, it is necessary to make the
“zero-one” assumption of income elasticities of expenditures and revenues, which is a cruder approach to
measuring α but conceptually the same.

how well those shocks can explain movements
in output that are not accounted for by other
economic shocks. Three problems are potentially relevant. As with reduced-form regressions,
statistical assumptions need to be made to identify the fiscal shocks. Second, most VARs ignore
the importance of debt dynamics in conditioning responses (whether or not a temporary rise
in debt causes households and firms to expect
future higher taxes is a key distinction between
Keynesian and classical views on the effectiveness of discretionary fiscal policy). Finally, as
with reduced-form regressions, VARs might not
reliably be able to resolve the timing issue.
By contrast, “narrative” approaches estimate
policy-driven changes in fiscal stimulus by looking directly at the historical record of legislation and public statements. The advantage of
this approach is that careful attention can be
directed to picking the timing of the shocks by
examining carefully when policy decisions were
made and announced. But such studies are very
resource intensive, making their application
across countries almost impossible. Further,
they are subjective, just as VARs and reducedform analysis rely on identifying assumptions. In
practice, analysis has centered around a small
number of extraordinary episodes of military
buildups, and there are questions as to how
much can be learned from such episodes about
discretionary fiscal policy during downturns.
A final approach examines specific “natural
experiments,” such as the effects of tax rebates.
See Chung and Leeper (2007). Favero and Giavazzi
(2007) do include debt stock.

The advantage of this approach is that it can
be directed at specific episodes for which it is
relatively easy to identify the policy change and
its intent. The corresponding disadvantage is
that, by examining a specific case, it can be hard
to draw broader lessons for policy.
This empirical work provides a mixed
picture of the ability of government spending to ­stimulate private demand.  (There is
less evidence about revenue-based measures.)
­Moreover, there appears to be a pattern
between the method used and the qualitative
results obtained. The table summarizes the
results of a selection of prominent papers in
the literature in terms of the signs of responses
of key variables to discretionary increases in
government spending.
In particular, SVAR-based studies in which
fiscal interventions are identified by assuming that government spending is predetermined within the quarter (see Blanchard and
Perotti, 2002) tend to find relatively strong
­positive effects, whereas narrative studies that rely on the reactions to episodes of
extraordinary spending have tended to find
much weaker, and even negative, relationships between episodes of fiscal stimulus and

Results

from case studies usually find positive
effects, but the effects are generally not as strong as
those generated by VAR studies. Studies of the 1975
tax rebates generally conclude that the effects were
positive but modest (that is, short-run multipliers of
about 0.2–0.5); see Modigliani and Steindel (1977)
and Blinder (1981). Studies of the 2001 tax rebates
have generated similar results; see Shapiro and
­Slemrod (2002).

Box 5.2 (concluded)
consumption. Ramey (2008) suggests that this
difference relates to the way that VARs treat
timing—if discretionary fiscal policy measures
are pre-announced, and households decrease
their spending right away (as predicted by neoclassical theory), VARs that measure the effect
based on actual changes to fiscal balances or
components might record a rise in the growth
rate of consumption on that date. This would
support a Keynesian view of fiscal policy, but
in fact the growth in consumption is driven

of tax changes find very large multipliers—see Romer
and Romer (2007).

pliers cover a wide range, from positive through
insignificant to negative. One reason is that
taking account of all the appropriate conditioning factors can be very difficult. Another reason
is methodological. Put simply, separating out
changes in discretionary fiscal policy from automatic stabilizers and evaluating their effects is
very difficult—in particular, fiscal policy simultaneously both responds to and causes changes
in economic activity. This “endogeneity problem” poses a major challenge for estimating the
effects of fiscal policy, as discussed in Box 5.2.

How Has Discretionary Fiscal Policy
Typically Responded?
The previous section identified two types of
critique of fiscal policy: skepticism that discretionary fiscal policy can be delivered efficiently,
owing to political constraints, and doubts that
it can be effective, for economic reasons. These
critiques frame the empirical analysis in this

from 0.5 (for example, Mountford and Uhlig, 2002) to

by recovery from the previous fall. Narrative approaches, on the other hand, take into
account the moment discretionary measures
are announced. Compared with these studies,
the reduced-form approach employed in this
chapter is conceptually closest to the SVAR
approach of Blanchard and Perotti (2002); to
the extent that the timing criticism applies to
this paper and those like it, it also applies to
our methodology. However, a comparative narrative study of all 41 economies in this study is
beyond the scope of this chapter.

section, which examines how fiscal policy has
typically responded to downturns.
Defining economic downturns and measuring fiscal stimulus are inevitably somewhat
subjective exercises. In the analysis that follows,
downturns are defined as periods during which
either the growth rate is negative or the output
gap is unusually negative, the precise threshold depending on whether quarterly or annual
data are used. This definition is arguably more
sensible than defining a downturn simply in
terms of negative growth, because that would
miss periods during which output is significantly
below potential but still rising.
The measures of fiscal stimulus used in this
chapter all start with the primary fiscal balance,
the difference between total general government revenues and expenditure net of interest
payments on consolidated general government
liabilities. Changes in the primary balance can
arise passively, as revenues and expenditures rise
and fall with economic activity, or actively, as
governments make choices about tax, transfer,
and spending policies. What is needed, therefore, is a measure of the cyclically adjusted primary balance, the intuition being that changes
in the cyclically adjusted primary balance should
reflect changes in policy. The first part of this

How Has Discretionary Fiscal Policy Typically Responded?

section looks at the responses of fiscal policy
to changes in economic activity, ­identifying
automatic stabilizers with changes in the cyclical component of the primary balance and
discretionary fiscal policy with changes in the
cyclically adjusted primary ­balance. Constructing this measure requires two slightly different
approaches, depending on the information
available for the economies being analyzed.

Figure 5.1. How Often and Quickly Has Fiscal Stimulus
Been Used in G7 Economies?1
Discretionary fiscal policy has been used less frequently than monetary policy and
automatic stabilizers during downturns, and has taken longer to arrive.

Evidence on the Responsiveness of Fiscal Policy
The empirical investigation begins with
analysis of advanced economies, for which long
spans of fiscal data are available on a quarterly
basis. Discretionary fiscal actions are those that
change the cyclically adjusted budget balance,
using estimates of the output gap together with
estimates of income elasticities of revenues and
expenditures to extract the cyclical component
from the budget. Figure 5.1 presents a summary of policy responses in G7 economies over
the past four decades. The numbers indicate
that discretionary fiscal stimulus has been delivered in downturns, but it has been used much
less frequently than automatic stabilizers and
monetary policy. Discretionary fiscal stimulus
has been used in about 23 percent of all downturn quarters—less than half as frequently as
interest-rate easing—whereas automatic stabilizers are observed in well over 95 percent of
downturns (upper panel). Discretionary policy

As

defined in Box 5.1 and the event analysis, the
cyclically adjusted balance is a residual and embodies all
changes in the primary balance not removed by cyclical
adjustment. This includes many factors not necessarily related to output stabilization, such as the impact of
structural reform, one-off items, and other economic
events (including asset price changes that are not cyclical
in nature and could therefore be identified as “automatic” changes in the fiscal balance—see Jaeger and
Schuknecht, 2007).
For further details about the following analysis, see
Leigh and Stehn (forthcoming).
These elasticities are taken from the OECD Economic
Outlook; see Appendix 5.1 for details.

ease in all downturns, because the applied definition of

also arrives later, on average about two and a
half quarters after the onset of a downturn, and
about one and a half quarters after interest-rate
easing (lower panel). Capital spending is particularly slow, with an arrival lag of almost four
quarters. By contrast, automatic fiscal easing,
proxied by a fall in the cyclical primary balance,
occurred in almost all downturns in the quarter
of the downturn itself.
The size of discretionary fiscal easing is also
much smaller on average than that of automatic
stabilizers. Figure 5.2 shows average impulse
responses of discretionary fiscal measures,
automatic stabilizers, and interest rates for the
G7 economies, drawing from vector autoregressions (VARs) estimated for two samples, an
“early” sample covering 1980:Q1–1991:Q4 and
a “late” sample covering 1992:Q1–2007:Q4. In
both samples, the discretionary fiscal easing is
much smaller than the automatic stabilizers and
is slower to arrive than both changes in interest
rates and automatic stabilizers. However, a comparison of the two panels also suggests that the
countercyclical response of discretionary fiscal
policy has strengthened since the early 1990s.
The responses of spending and revenue components in the early sample reflect a combination
of mildly procyclical revenue increases, small
countercyclical current spending increases, and
large procyclical capital spending cuts. The
greater degree of fiscal policy countercyclicality observed since the early 1990s is the result
of cuts in revenues, larger increases in current
spending, and smaller procyclical cuts in capital
spending. The response of automatic stabilizSee Appendix 5.1 for more details. Note that, unlike
much of the VAR literature, the analysis presented here
does not evaluate the response of growth to fiscal policy
shocks. Rather, the focus is on the response of fiscal
policy variables to changes in growth.
In the early sample, discretionary fiscal policy is procyclical on impact and provides a cumulative procyclical
contraction of around 0.1 percentage point of potential
GDP over four quarters. In the later sample, even though
discretionary policy still produces no stimulus on impact,
it leads to a cumulative stimulus of 0.2 percentage point
over four quarters. This finding is consistent with, for
example, Galí and Perotti (2003) and World Economic
Outlook (September 2003).

ers remained unchanged in the second sample,
while that of monetary policy strengthened.
Figure 5.3 shows that there are noticeable
­cross‑country differences across advanced economies. Discretionary fiscal policy and monetary
policy have been more timely and more countercyclical in the United States, Canada, and the
United Kingdom (the G7’s three Anglophone
countries) than in the rest of the G7. The
other Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD) member countries
display even weaker countercyclicality than the
United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom
in both monetary and discretionary fiscal policy.

Data Uncertainties and the Risk of Debt Bias
A concern that often arises regarding countercyclical fiscal activism is that policymakers
may respond in an asymmetric manner, easing
in downturns and not tightening sufficiently in
upturns, implying a permanent increase in the
public-debt-to-GDP ratio with potentially adverse
consequences for long-run growth. To investigate whether fiscal policy in G7 countries has
displayed such an asymmetric tendency, the VAR
framework is adapted to allow for an asymmetric
response to upturns and downturns (see Appendix 5.1). The results suggest that both fiscal
policy and monetary policy are subject to an easing bias; that is, more easing during downturns
than tightening during upturns (Figure 5.4). In
contrast, automatic stabilizers respond in a symmetric way, with the easing observed in downturns almost exactly offset by tightening during
upturns.
Hence, although discretionary fiscal policy
has been actively used, there are valid concerns
about debt bias. For illustration, a case study
of tax-based stimulus legislation in the United
States is provided in Box 5.3. The study finds
that, although reasonably timely, 38 percent of
cyclically motivated tax cuts were permanent.
An additional concern in the analysis of
countercyclical fiscal activism is that policymakers face substantial uncertainties regarding the
cyclical position and run the risk of destabilizing

the economy by responding to erroneously perceived downturns. This appears to be a serious
problem, based on an assessment of the reliability of preliminary GDP estimates produced by
national authorities.10 There is a strong negative
relationship between preliminary growth estimates and subsequent revisions. Forty percent
of preliminary estimates indicating negative
quarter-over-quarter growth were subsequently
revised to positive growth.11 Forecast efficiency
tests find strong evidence of a bias toward pessimism in preliminary growth estimates.12
To investigate how fiscal policy in G7 countries has been affected by errors in growth
estimates, the VAR framework is augmented
with growth-estimation errors (see Appendix
5.1). The results reported in Figure 5.5 confirm
that both fiscal and interest rate policy have
been affected by errors in preliminary growth
estimates, with a 1 percentage point fall in
­perceived growth relative to final revised growth
associated with an easing in interest rates and
the discretionary fiscal-balance-to-potential GDP
ratio by about 0.2 percentage point. This finding
suggests that concern over policy errors is well
founded, especially as fiscal policy ­decisions
appear to be less easily reversed than monetary
policy decisions, and fiscal policy errors bear
potentially long-lived consequences for debt.

Are Fiscal Policy Reactions Different in
Emerging and Advanced Economies?
Some of the reservations about the application of discretionary fiscal policy may apply
even more strongly in less advanced economies.
Unfortunately, although the data in the previous
section were available at quarterly frequency,
consistent data for a broader set of econo-

-0.6
10See Appendix 5.1. See also Cimadomo (2008) for
further analysis of fiscal policy using real-time data.
11At the same time, 30 percent of quarters that, according to the final data actually had negative growth, showed
positive growth in preliminary estimates.
12While remaining statistically significant, this bias
appears to have declined in recent years, possibly reflecting the more stable and predictable growth environment.

Are fiscal policy reactions different in emerging and advanced economies?

mies are available only at annual frequency.
In what follows, the analysis uses a sample of
21 advanced economies and 20 emerging economies, covering the period from 1970 to 2007.13
The definition of “downturn” is conceptually
the same as used previously with the quarterly
data, but “unusually negative” is now defined
as below –0.5 standard deviation of the output
gap, on account of the use of annual data.14
For advanced economies, OECD estimates of
income elasticities of revenues and expenditures are used to calculate the cyclical balance.
However, such estimates are not available for
emerging economies, and so it is assumed
that revenues move one-for-one with the business cycle, but expenditures do not—that is,
the income elasticity of revenues is 1 and the
income elasticity of expenditures is zero (see
Appendix 5.1 for details). A fiscal expansion is
then defined as a negative change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance of more than
0.25 percentage point and a fiscal contraction
as a positive change of more than 0.25 percentage point. When the change in the cyclically
adjusted primary balance is less than 0.25 percentage point (either positive or negative), fiscal
policy is considered neutral. Hence, we have
three states for the fiscal stance: stimulus (397
episodes), neutral (155 episodes), and tightening (437 episodes).
In addition to the assumptions necessarily
imposed when choosing data sets and definitions, a number of caveats apply to analysis using
these measures. In particular, the use of annual
data limits the ability to accurately characterize
fiscal interventions that begin and end within
a year. Second, what is relevant is policymakers’ perceptions of the state of the economy in
real time, which might differ substantially from
inferences made using revised data, but, in the
13See

Appendix 5.1 for a list of economies and episodes
of downturns.
14Correspondingly, upturns are defined as episodes
during which the output gap is above 0.5 standard deviation. Potential output is measured using the HodrickPrescott filter, with λ set to 6.25, the value recommended
in Ravn and Uhlig (2002).

Chapter 5   Fiscal Policy as a Countercyclical Tool

Box 5.3. Have U.S. Tax Cuts Been “TTT”?
This box takes a closer look at whether fiscal
interventions in the United States have been
timely, temporary, and targeted (TTT). A
recent data set compiled by Romer and Romer
(2007) of all significant tax changes signed
into law since 1945 permits a detailed analysis
of this issue. By consulting official documents,
Romer and Romer distinguish tax changes
that were explicitly motivated by cyclical
considerations from those motivated by other
factors, including long-run growth support,
debt reduction, and the financing of additional
expenditures. Of all the 50 significant federal
tax actions identified, 7 were assessed as cyclical, and, of these, 5 were tax cuts designed to
stimulate short-run growth.
This box focuses on these five tax cuts,
implemented between 1970 and 2002, as well
as the Economic Stimulus Act, signed into law
in February 2008. The box assesses how quickly
after the onset of a downturn the tax cuts were

legislated and implemented, how temporary
they were, and how well targeted they were. In
assessing how close to a downturn the tax cuts
arrived, the analysis defines a downturn as in
the main text. Growth data to assess the 2008:
Q2 stimulus are not yet available.
The main results are as follows:
• Timeliness: Four out of the five cyclically motivated tax cuts occurred within one quarter of
a downturn (see table). In the case of 2002,
the stimulus arrived three quarters after the
downturn. The average implementation lag of
tax cuts; that is, the delay between the signing
of the legislation into law and its impact on
revenue, was one quarter.
• Temporariness: Although only one of the six
cyclically motivated tax cuts was permanent,
the remainder contained a permanent
component (see table). In particular, about
79 percent of the tax cuts were designed to be
temporary, with an average planned duration of two quarters. Some of the tax cuts
were subsequently extended, so that a smaller
proportion—62 percent—actually ended up

being temporary, and 38 percent became
permanent.
• Targeting: The targeting efficiency of each
tax cut package is assessed using the costeffectiveness classification scheme of the
Congressional Budget Office (CBO, 2008),
which indicates the likely bang-for-the-buck
impact on aggregate demand of a range of
possible fiscal stimulus tools. Based on this
classification scheme, three out of the six
cyclically motivated tax cuts are classified as
cost-effective. More than half of the content
of these three tax packages consisted of per-

absence of consistent real-time vintages of data,
it is difficult to adjust for this difference.
Bearing these caveats in mind, the analysis
identified the following stylized facts:
• Emerging economies respond during downturns with fiscal stimulus only half as frequently as advanced economies: 22 percent
versus 41 percent (Figure 5.6, top panel).
When emerging economies do implement fiscal stimulus, the response is slightly higher, as
measured by changes in the cyclically adjusted
primary balance as a percent of potential
GDP (Figure 5.6, middle panel, first and third
bars). But this is because downturns are larger
(Figure 5.6, middle panel, second and fourth
bars).
• In just over one-third of episodes, fiscal stimulus involved a mixture of revenue and expenditure changes. Of those that relied mainly on
one kind of stimulus, expenditure measures
dominate for both advanced and emerging
economies (Figure 5.6, bottom panel).
• In emerging economies, changes in the overall primary balance are usually procyclical,
despite countercyclical effects from automatic
stabilizers (Figure 5.7, top panel).15 And they
are more procyclical in downturns when
15This finding is consistent with Kaminsky, Reinhart,
and Végh (2004) and a number of other studies. It holds

sonal direct transfers and personal lump-sum
rebates—two fiscal tools assessed as being
the most cost-effective by the CBO. The most
recent, 2008, stimulus scored highest on this
account, followed by 1975 and 2001. The
least cost-effective stimulus measures were
the 1970 and 2002 tax reductions, the bulk
of which consisted of corporate lump-sum
rebates and personal and corporate tax-rate
reductions.
Hence, for the most part, fiscal interventions
in the United States have been timely, but not
always temporary or well targeted.

advanced economies are simultaneously experiencing downturns, consistent with rises in
external financing premiums (Figure 5.7, bottom panel). In advanced economies, changes
in the primary fiscal balance are, on average,
countercyclical, mostly because of automatic
stabilizers, as measured by changes in the
cyclical balance.

The Macroeconomic Effects of
Discretionary Fiscal Policy
Having defined downturns and episodes of
fiscal stimulus, this section turns to the central
question: What are the macroeconomic effects
of discretionary fiscal policy, especially during
downturns? An event analysis identifies some
of the basic patterns, using the same elasticitybased fiscal impulse measure as in the previous
section, and then regressions provide a more
systematic assessment of cause and effect.

An Event Analysis of Episodes of Downturns and
Fiscal Stimulus
The event analysis shows the dynamics of key
macroeconomic variables—real GDP growth, the
across both fixed and floating exchange rate regimes at
the time of the episode.

debt-to-GDP ratio, inflation, exchange rates, the
current account, and money growth—around
episodes of downturns. Table 5.1 and Figure 5.8
show how macroeconomic variables move
together with fiscal stimulus before, during, and
after downturns. As expected, the debt-to-GDP
ratio increases following a fiscal stimulus and
improves when it tightens, while current account
balances improve in the downturn year when
there is tightening and deteriorate when there is
stimulus. But for other variables, the results are
generally ambiguous. In particular, growth rates
are larger in episodes without fiscal stimulus, but
the change in growth rates from the downturn
year to the first year after the downturn is somewhat larger when there is fiscal stimulus. These
observations are common across advanced and
emerging economies.
Table 5.2 shows median values of real GDP
growth across all economies during episodes
of downturns and fiscal stimulus for a number of variables that theory suggests could
have important effects: public debt, current
account balances, trade openness, and the
exchange rate regime.16 Figure 5.9 shows the
difference between growth rates in the year of
the downturn and the year following. Looking
across these conditioning factors, there is little
discernible difference in the impact of fiscal
policy from variations in the current account
balance, openness to trade, and the exchange
rate regime, despite what theory suggests. However, the level of public debt does appear to be
associated with consistent differences in growth
outcomes—economies that implement fiscal
stimulus and have high public debt going into
a downturn typically experience lower growth
rates before and after the downturn year and
16For the first three of these variables, the results are
divided into “high” and “low” cases, based on the average
for that variable three years before the recession episode.
The thresholds for high and low are the median values of
the overall sample, except debt, for which the threshold
for high debt is 75 percent for advanced economies
and 25 percent for emerging economies. Exchange
rate regimes are categorized according to whether the
exchange rate was fixed or floating in the first year of the
downturn.

The Macroeconomic Effects of Discretionary Fiscal Policy

less of a pickup in growth in the year following
fiscal stimulus, whereas high-debt economies
that implement fiscal tightening experience
stronger gains in growth.
Turning to the ways fiscal policy was implemented, economies that employed a combination of revenue and expenditure stimulus
experienced less-severe downturns compared
with those that relied on revenue or expenditure
measures alone, although revenue-based policies
were associated with faster recoveries and higher
growth in the years following (Table 5.3).17 Conversely, expenditure-based fiscal tightening was
associated with higher growth in years following
the downturn.
In summary, the event analysis indicates that
taking into account debt and the composition
of fiscal stimulus could be important to understanding the effects of fiscal policy. Conversely,
it is difficult to see clear patterns with other variables that theory indicates could be important.

Note: For each variable, the median is recorded for the three categories of fiscal stance during the first year of the downturn: stimulus, neutral
policy, and tightening. In each case, values are recorded for the average of the median three years before the downturn, one year before the
downturn, the first year of the downturn itself, one year after the whole downturn episode, and the average for the four years after the downturn
episode. Note that some downturns last for more than one year. In a multiyear downturn, the year after the downturn is the first year after the
last downturn year.

stimulus, and taking into account factors that
might affect the transmission of fiscal stimulus.
The main regressor of interest is the fiscal
impulse measure.19 Ideally, the fiscal impulse
measure would pick up all discretionary changes
in fiscal stance, whether from systematic reactions to the state of the economy or nonsystematic (that is, unexpected) discretionary actions.
The systematic component of the fiscal impulse
measure is, however, endogenous, which leads
to problems with statistical inference. Moreover,
as discussed in Box 5.2, it is very difficult to
distinguish systematic changes in fiscal policy
from automatic stabilizers. In principle, the
elasticity-based fiscal impulse measure used in
the previous section should achieve this, but
19Note that all the variables are now continuous and no
longer use the categories of the event analysis.

176

unless the elasticities are perfectly accurate for
each period—and potential output is measured
correctly—this type of fiscal impulse measure
will likely suffer from additional, measurementerror-related endogeneity, undermining the
validity of the regressions.
To reduce these endogeneity problems and
check for robustness, a second fiscal impulse
measure is used that focuses exclusively on
the nonsystematic component of discretionary fiscal policy (as is also the case in the fiscal
literature that uses structural vector autoregression (SVAR) and “narrative” approaches; see
Box 5.2). This measure aims to identify unexpected changes in fiscal stance, based for each
country on separate regressions of revenues
and expenditures on output growth and a time
trend—see Appendix 5.1 for details. (In what
follows, this measure will be referred to as the

The Macroeconomic Effects of Discretionary Fiscal Policy

regression-based fiscal impulse measure, to distinguish it from the elasticity-based measure.)
Other regressors include two lags of real GDP
growth, to control for endogenous inertia in the
economy; real money growth (contemporaneous
and two lags), as a measure of monetary policy;
changes in foreign demand (contemporaneous
and two lags); and government size. These were
found to be significant at the 10 percent level
and were retained in all regression specifications
that follow.
Table 5.4 presents the key results in terms
of responses of real GDP to a 1 percent fiscal
impulse, using both the elasticity-based and
regression-based fiscal impulse measures.20 The
values show the output effects in the year of the
fiscal intervention and three years later, with a
positive number indicating that positive fiscal
stimulus raises output.21 The results for the baseline specification are presented in the first row.
For both fiscal impulse measures, the estimated
effect of fiscal stimulus on output growth in the
baseline specification is weak—closer to zero
than the Keynesian assumption of 1 or more—
and turns negative after three years. However, as
can be seen in the second and third rows of the
table, this conceals important differences across
countries. In advanced economies, the multipliers are statistically significant and moderately
positive—a 1 percentage point fiscal stimulus
leads to an increase in real GDP growth of about
0.1 percent on impact, and up to 0.5 percent
above its level in year 0 after three years. This is
broadly comparable with the effects found from
previous SVAR studies and case studies. By contrast, although emerging economies see impact
effects similar to those of advanced economies,
the effects on output in the medium term are
consistently negative across both fiscal impulse
measures—for these economies, discretionary

1Fiscal impulse is identified during the first year of a downturn as a decline in the cyclically adjusted primary-balance-to-GDP ratio below 0.25
percentage point of GDP.
2Initial conditions for variables are defined as a three-year average before the year of a downturn.
3The threshold for high debt is 75 percent for advanced economies and 25 percent for emerging economies. All other variable thresholds are
the median of the variable across the sample.
4A positive value for the current account balance indicates a surplus; a negative value indicates a deficit.

fiscal policy does indeed appear to do more
harm than good.
The output responses shown in the next six
rows of the table indicate that, overall, revenue-based stimulus measures seem to be more
effective in boosting real GDP than expenditure-based measures, particularly in the medium
term and in advanced economies. Expenditurebased impulses are found to have consistently
negative effects in emerging economies after
three years, perhaps reflecting concerns that,
once implemented, increased expenditures are
difficult to remove.
A key question is whether discretionary fiscal
policy can successfully stimulate the economy
during downturns. This is addressed in the final
four rows of the table. When controlling for
downturns, the general effects of fiscal interventions appear to be positive and, if anything, show
slightly stronger effects than the baseline specification. However, it is possible that the results for
these multipliers are driven by strong negative
effects from fiscal tightening and do not reflect
significantly positive effects from fiscal stimulus.
When controlling specifically for the effects of
fiscal stimulus, the effects are in fact consistently
negative across the two fiscal impulse measures
(although there is some improvement in output

178

growth in the years that follow, such that the
level of output is less negative than initially).
What could be driving such a different result?
One concern is that the fiscal impulse measures
are not adequately dealing with the endogeneity
problem, especially the elasticity-based measure,
which could lead to biased results.22 If it is not a
measurement problem, the effects could depend
on private sector expectations of the debt
implications of the fiscal stimulus. The final two
rows show how the effects depend on the level
of public debt at the time of the intervention. In
low-debt economies, the initial effect of a fiscal
stimulus is negative, but there is a positive effect
on growth in the years that follow, such that the
net effect after three years is relatively negative when using the elasticity-based measure,
and positive when using the regression-based
measure. By contrast, in high-debt economies
22For example, during downturns both fiscal revenues
and output fall. To the extent that the regressions do
not correct for the response of automatic stabilizers,
an automatic response might be picked up as a fiscal
­stimulus, which, unsurprisingly, is identified as “ineffective” in the regressions. This is more likely in the
elasticity-based approach—the assumption of unit-revenue elasticities for emerging economies, for example,
may well be too low. This would tend to bias results,
especially for the short run.

A Simulation-Based Perspective on Fiscal Stimulus

the effect is consistently large and persistently
negative. This suggests that concerns about fiscal
sustainability may be dominating spending decisions, even if current fiscal policy would traditionally be thought of as stimulatory.23
Additional regressions were run that included
interaction terms of the fiscal impulse measure
and dummies indicating (1) high or low openness to trade; (2) high or low levels of financial
development, as a measure of liquidity constraints; (3) fixed versus floating exchange rate
regimes; and (4) high or low current account
surpluses, as a measure of external sustainability. Higher levels of trade openness and financial development yield higher multipliers, and
multipliers are higher under floating exchange
rate regimes. These results run contrary to
economic theory, suggesting that debt concerns
might dominate the effectiveness of fiscal policy.
Indeed, higher-than-average current account
balances (generally surpluses) tend to be associated with larger multipliers.24 Finally, running
the baseline regression using two different time
subsamples yields a cautionary note: multipliers
have apparently been weaker in recent years.25
The evidence from this analysis indicates that
discretionary fiscal policy can successfully stimulate output growth, especially if it is ­revenuebased. But there are reasons for caution in
employing stimulus packages during downturns,
with evidence suggesting that, if it is to work at
all, it will do so only when underlying fiscal positions are sound. This indicates that governments
need to improve balances during upturns and
make credible commitments that stimulus packages will not threaten debt sustainability.

Policies under Various Initial Conditions

24In the medium term, the multipliers are positive
when using the regression-based fiscal impulse measure
but still negative when using the elasticity-based fiscal
impulse measure.
25This is particularly true for advanced economies. One
potential explanation, consistent with both the empirical evidence and the simulations presented later, is that
monetary policy has become less accommodative in those
economies.

A Simulation-Based Perspective on
Fiscal Stimulus
The previous section finds some evidence
for moderately positive multipliers, but with
important caveats about the type of economy,
the composition of the fiscal impulse, and the
level of debt. Clearly, there is a large number
of potentially important factors that policymakers need to take into account when designing a
discretionary fiscal policy action. The objective
of this section is to examine, in a controlled
setting, how the effects of fiscal stimulus depend
on the structure of the economy in question.
The model used is an annual version of the
Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal Model
(GIMF). GIMF is a multicountry dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model that includes
a number of useful features relative to existing
monetary business cycle models (such as both
myopic and liquidity-constrained consumers
and potential long-term productivity benefits
from government investment) and a wide range
of fiscal instruments affecting household and
business intertemporal choices (government
investment, labor taxes, consumption taxes, and
transfers to households).26
26The country blocs are the United States, the euro
area, Japan, emerging Asia, and the remaining economies. For a more detailed description of the model, see
Kumhof and Laxton (2008).

180

The first exercise compares outcomes for key
macroeconomic variables using various fiscal
policy instruments for a large economy, calibrated to match the United States. The results
are presented in Figure 5.10. The shock is a
temporary fiscal expansion, calibrated to deliver
a primary deficit that is 1 percent above baseline
in year 1 and 0.5 percent above baseline in year
2. Thereafter, a fiscal reaction function ensures
that debt is brought back to its initial level by
raising lump-sum taxes. The fiscal stimulus is
completely unanticipated in the first year, but
its time profile, including the further stimulus
in year 2 and the longer-term implications for
taxes, is fully understood once initiated. Each
row of Figure 5.10 shows the reactions of, from
left to right, GDP (in percentage deviations
from the baseline), inflation and nominal interest rates (in percentage point deviations from
baseline), and real interest rates (in percentage
point deviations from baseline). Going down
the figure, successive rows show the impact of
various fiscal instruments: government investment, consumption taxes, labor income taxes,
and transfers to households. In each panel, two
responses are shown: one in which nominal
interest rates are assumed to react to expected
deviations of inflation from target, and one in
which nominal interest rates are held constant
for the initial two years, thereby accommodating
the fiscal stimulus.

In each case, there are no long-run changes
in potential output; eventually, each of the
variables will return to zero.27 Hence, the experiment focuses on the differences in the short-run
impact of the policy measures. The results show
the following:
• For the same increase in deficit, there are
large differences in the size of short-run multipliers across instruments. On the assumption that it can be implemented immediately
and efficiently, government investment has
a larger effect than other measures.28 This
is because it has a direct effect on aggregate
demand, whereas the effects of taxes and
transfers depend on propensities to consume.
Investment also has the largest effect on inflation and real interest rates.

27This

Year three

is also true for government investment, but in
this case the effect on output is much more long lived,
because government infrastructure capital has productive
benefits that depreciate only slowly over time.
28This is in contrast to the empirical results, which
showed more positive effects from revenue-based stimulus. In these simulations, private agents understand that
debt will be maintained at initial levels. In practice, it
could be that expenditure-based packages are more likely
to be made permanent and therefore raise concerns
about debt sustainability.

• The monetary policy regime plays a key role
in the effectiveness of fiscal stimulus—with
accommodation, the output multipliers
are up to twice as large, and the effects are
more persistent.29 Concomitantly, inflation
is higher. The difference is least for labor
taxes, because lowering labor taxes increases
­incentives for work as well as consumption. As
a result, a supply response mutes the inflationary impact. It can also be shown that without
monetary accommodation, multipliers are
smaller when prices are more flexible.30 This
is because inflation increases more strongly
following the stimulus, thereby necessitating
a more aggressive hike in interest rates that
reduces the output response. With monetary
accommodation, greater price flexibility has
the opposite effect, because higher inflation
implies a larger drop in real interest rates.
• Cuts in the consumption tax and temporarily higher household transfers have a clear
29This is consistent with the view that fiscal policy could
be most effective when monetary policy is least effective,
such as when nominal interest rates are close to zero or
the monetary harmonization mechanism is imparied.
30Simulations for different degrees of price flexibility
are not shown in Figure 5.7.

A Simulation-Based Perspective on Fiscal Stimulus

“tilting” effect on output (output is above,
then below baseline), because they provide
incentives to bring forward consumption and
investment.31 Cuts in labor taxes, on the other
hand, generate a more consistently positive
supply response.
If policy measures are made permanent and
financed by an increase in debt, then long-run
supply and debt effects become much more
important. For all fiscal instruments, higher debt
tends to crowd out private output because it
leads to higher real interest rates.32 When there
is a permanent increase in transfers, regardless
of short-run monetary accommodation, the real
interest rate rises in the long run, which reduces
output or, at best, leaves it unchanged. Lower
tax rates, on the other hand, reduce supply
distortions, and therefore generate permanent
increases in output, more so when labor taxes
are lowered than when consumption taxes are
lowered. Making lower tax rates permanent
could raise the short-term impact, depending
on the balance between the positive supply-side
effect and negative interest rate effects. The
effects from permanently higher government
investment depend on whether the spending
can generate a higher rate of return than if the
resources were available to private investors.
How do the multipliers differ according to
the characteristics of the economy? Additional
simulations show the following:
• For any given size of fiscal stimulus, multipliers are lower in smaller and more open
economies—see Figure 5.11—although those
for labor taxes fall by less.33

31This

is an example of a temporary fiscal policy
change that is effective because of forward-looking expectations, showing that the “permanent income” criticism of
temporary policy measures does not always hold.
32In small countries—that is, small enough that interest rates are exogenous—this is still likely to happen.
The degree depends on changes in interest rate risk
premiums.
33The empirical results in the previous section point to
the opposite result: multipliers are higher in smaller and
more open economies. This suggests that the measure
of openness used in the regressions is picking up other
effects not accounted for in these simulations.

• A higher share of liquidity-constrained consumers, as might be expected in most emerging economies, results in significantly larger
multipliers.
• At the same time, fiscal stimulus may lead, in
high-debt emerging economies, to an increase
in real interest rates as market participants
demand a higher interest rate risk premium.
This reduces output multipliers, especially
for revenue-based measures, as shown in
Figure 5.12. If the increase in interest rate
risk premiums is large enough, the multipliers are negative. It is possible that this is the
mechanism driving the negative results of
fiscal stimulus seen from the empirical work
in Table 5.4.
These results indicate that the effects of fiscal
stimulus are likely to vary considerably, depending on how the stimulus is implemented and on
the type of economy. The results support the
idea that the degree of monetary policy accommodation is important, which may have played
a role in the smaller estimates of fiscal multipliers in recent years. This is not to say that fiscal
policy cannot work; rather, it is likely to be most
effective when monetary policy is constrained
and ineffective (see also Blinder, 2006). The
results also illustrate a potentially important
mechanism by which concerns about public
debt sustainability could lower fiscal multipliers
to a point at which discretionary fiscal policy
would do more harm than good.

Conclusions and Policy Considerations
This chapter addresses a simple question:
What are the effects of fiscal policy during
downturns? The analysis indicates that the
answer is complicated and highly dependent on
an economy’s characteristics.
One obvious appeal of discretionary fiscal
policy is that governments can potentially have
a quick effect on spending power, whereas the
effects of monetary policy are subject to long
and sometimes uncertain lags. And in practice,
the policy record in advanced economies shows
that discretionary fiscal policy has been used

Chapter 5   Fiscal Policy as a Countercyclical Tool

actively, although not nearly as much as automatic stabilizers or monetary policy. However,
discretionary measures have typically been
implemented later than automatic stabilizers
and changes in monetary stance; they are more
often a response to downturns than upturns,
sometimes more than necessary; and stimulus
measures have often been made permanent,
which has had adverse implications for fiscal
sustainability.
An examination of the average effects of
discretionary fiscal policy across a combined
sample of advanced and emerging economies
does not provide strong evidence of countercyclical effects on activity. However, a closer
analysis suggests that the effects are moderately
­countercyclical in advanced economies. By
contrast, there is only weak evidence for countercylical effects in emerging economies, and
only initially, with indications that effects turn
negative in subsequent years. Revenue-based
stimulus measures seem to be more effective
at boosting output than expenditure-based
measures, especially in emerging economies,
perhaps reflecting concerns that, once implemented, increased expenditures are difficult
to remove.
These empirical findings are broadly consistent with simulations from a multiperiod
general equilibrium model. The simulations
show how the fiscal multiplier can vary from
­Keynesian (1 or greater) to negative, depending on the instrument used and the type of
economy. In particular, the multiplier is lower
when monetary reaction does not accommodate
the fiscal stimulus and when there is a strong
increase in risk premiums following fiscal stimulus (such as when concerns about servicing
debt obligations are high). Increased government spending can be the most direct means
of increasing output, if it can be implemented
quickly. On the other hand, it is the most
inflationary. Tax changes that provide greater
rewards for work effort or incentives for bringing consumption forward might be nearly as
effective in supporting economic activity, with
less risk of inflation.

186

Given both the interest in fiscal policy as a
countercyclical tool and the evidence that discretionary fiscal stimulus can have adverse effects,
should governments rely more on automatic
stabilizers? Or is it possible to design alternative
countercyclical fiscal policy mechanisms that
would respond symmetrically and more quickly
to changes in the state of economy?34
There are two broad possibilities, each with its
advantages and disadvantages.
Increasing the responsiveness of automatic stabilizers: The extent of passive automatic stabilizers
could be augmented, for example, by increasing the progressivity of the revenue system.
Such mechanisms would work automatically
and would not necessarily increase the size
of government. A related approach would be
to change certain tax, transfer, or spending
programs to introduce links to the state of
the economy following simple rules, akin to
the ­Taylor rule for setting interest rates. This
could be done by implementing pre-approved
temporary spending programs or raising
unemployment insurance benefits once the
unemployment rate reaches a certain threshold.
An advantage of such an approach would be its
transparency.
However, such schemes could also bring
unintended consequences that would need
to be weighed against possible stabilization
benefits. A system of temporary consumption
tax changes could lead to self-fulfilling falls in
current consumption if tax cuts were anticipated. Proposals that call for automatic triggers
in response to cyclical developments are also
problematic because there are no completely
reliable real-time measures of the state of the
economy. Responses based on previous periods’
outcomes—such as an automatic tax rebate—
could be more accurate and less distortionary
but might not be as well targeted as those that
34This idea goes back at least to Musgrave (1959, p.
512), who coined the phrase “formula flexibility” to
describe a system in which changes in taxes and/or
expenditures would be legislated in advance to respond
to changes in income. More recently, versions have been
advocated in Seidman (2003).

Appendix 5.1. Data and Empirical Methods

are based on current income. It might also be
difficult to develop predetermined state-contingent spending programs that are a well-targeted
and efficient use of public money (Solow, 2005).
Furthermore, all of the above could introduce
distortions: schemes to increase tax progressivity or tie unemployment insurance generosity to
the state of the economy would likely alter work
incentives, and might prove politically difficult
to adhere to during upturns. Thus, they would
have to flanked with measures to improve the
targeting of support during downturns. Better
targeting, however, is likely to pose administrative challenges that could prove expensive to
address.
Changes in fiscal policy governance: Broader
reforms could bolster the credibility of discretionary policy actions, in particular, to reduce
the risk of debt bias. This might involve establishing an independent, nonpartisan government agency, such as already exist in many
countries—a sort of “fiscal watchdog”—charged
with identifying changes in the cyclical state of
the economy, assessing the extent to which fiscal
policy is consistent with medium-term objectives,
and providing advice on various policy measures.35 This would minimize partisan judgment
in the evaluation of economic information and
would avoid relying solely on statistical measures of the state of the economy, which can be
imprecise. In addition, this arrangement could
increase the timeliness and temporariness of
the fiscal impulse. Such agencies could also be
entrusted with giving advice on which tax and
expenditure parameters to vary, as they indeed
already do in a number of countries.36
35For example, the objective of the Swedish Fiscal
Policy Council is to provide an independent evaluation of
the Swedish government’s fiscal policy, including whether
fiscal policy is consistent with the state of the economy in
the business cycle.
36 Some have even proposed that governments delegate limited fiscal responsibility to these nonpartisan
agencies, for exclusive use in macroeconomic stabilization (see Ball, 1997, and Calmfors, 2003). Under existing proposals, such agencies could vary certain tax or
expenditure parameters, within certain limits set out by
the legislative branch and on the basis of a narrow stabi-

Clearly, a careful examination of the potential costs and risks of such systems would
be required before implementing any such
approaches. In addition to the choice of fiscal
instruments and the administrative complexities
of changing tax rates or expenditure plans, the
system would have to be coordinated with monetary policy goals (see Taylor, 2000). Nonetheless,
given the limitations of automatic stabilizers as
currently implemented and the risks associated
with discretionary fiscal policy, the idea deserves
further examination.

Appendix 5.1. Data and Empirical
Methods
Evidence on the Responsiveness of Fiscal Policy
Quarterly data on the output gap and real
GDP growth are taken from the OECD Economic
Outlook, and are seasonally adjusted. Downturns
are defined as quarters in which growth is either
negative or below potential, with the output gap
more than one standard deviation below zero.
Changes in monetary policy are proxied by the
quarterly change in the nominal short-term
interest rate taken from the IMF’s International
Financial Statistics database. All changes are
quarter-over-quarter and unannualized. The
analysis focuses on “large” changes in discretionary fiscal variables, defined as those that exceed
0.25 percent of GDP a quarter. Similarly, discretionary changes in nominal short-term interest
rates are defined as those that exceed 0.25 percent in one quarter.
The vector autoregression (VAR) is estimated
for each country using quarterly data. The variables included in the VARs, and their ordering,
are as follows: actual real GDP growth minus
potential real GDP growth, inflation (based

lization mandate supplemented by strict accountability
requirements. A weakness of such proposals is they present a challenge regarding the role of government and
they make it dificult to establish a dividing line between
the agency and government in terms of countercyclical
fiscal policy (see Debrun, Hauner, and Kumar, 2008, for
a detailed survey).

187

Chapter 5   Fiscal Policy as a Countercyclical Tool

on the GDP deflator), changes in the nominal
interest rate, changes in the primary cyclically
adjusted fiscal balance, and changes in the
automatic (cyclical) fiscal balance. This ordering implies that although policy variables can
respond to growth and inflation shocks within
one quarter, the transmission lag from policy
variables to growth and inflation is at least one
quarter. Two lags of each variable are included
in the VAR.

Data Uncertainties and the Risk of Debt Bias
For the purposes of testing for asymmetric
responses, each VAR now includes the following variables: growth when the economy is in a
downturn and zero otherwise; growth when the
economy is in an upturn and zero otherwise;
and the previously included variables, that is,
inflation, changes in nominal interest rates, and
changes in fiscal balances. As before, downturns
are defined as quarters in which growth is either
negative or below potential, with the output gap
more than one standard deviation below zero.
The results are robust to changing the ordering of the two halves of growth (downturns and
upturns) in the VAR, to alternative ordering
for the fiscal and monetary policy variables,
and to including a time trend in each equation.
Because the VAR is specified in first differences,
any trend in fiscal balances over the sample
period affects the constant term in the fiscal balance equation.
For the purposes of testing the reliability of
preliminary GDP estimates, the analysis updates
the estimates of Faust, Rogers, and Wright
(2005), which used data ending in 1997. Revisions are defined as the difference between the
data as they stood in the most recent OECD
Monthly Economic Indicators (June 2008) and
the data when they were first published in the
Monthly Economic Indicators. For the United
States, the United Kingdom, and Canada,
preliminary data are available beginning
in 1965:Q1. For Japan, the starting date is 1970:
Q1; for Italy and Germany, 1979:Q4; and for
France, 1987:Q4.

188

For the purposes of evaluating the effect
of growth estimation errors, each VAR now
includes the preliminary estimation errors in
addition to the previously included variables.
The estimation errors are ordered in the
VARs after growth and inflation but before the
policy variables. The results are robust to alternative ordering among the errors and policy
variables.

Policy Reactions in Emerging and Advanced
Economies
The analysis uses a sample of 21 advanced
economies and 20 emerging economies from
the IMF’s World Economic Outlook (WEO)
database, covering the period from 1970
to 2007. 37 The sample includes annual data for
general government revenues and expenditures
(net of interest payments). Other macroeconomic data (for example, for external balances
and inflation) are sourced from the World
Bank’s World Development Indicators database,
the WEO database, and other public sources.
The list of economies and episodes of downturn is in Table 5.5 (with years of fiscal stimulus in bold).
In addition to the WEO data, an examination was made using the IMF’s Government
Finance Statistics Manual (GFS) data. One
advantage of this data set is that it offers
greater disaggregation—revenues can be broken down into personal, corporate, consumption, and trade. Taxes and expenditures can be
broken down into household, nonprofit institution, and corporate transfers (subsidies); interest; government employee wages; and other
expenditures as well as capital spending. Moredisaggregated data potentially allow for finer
distinctions regarding the income elasticities
of taxes and spending and therefore a more
accurate measure of automatic versus cyclical
adjustments in revenues and expenditures.
Extensive comparisons were made between

the sample used for regressions.

downturn, with fiscal stimulus defined as a decline in the cyclically
adjusted primary balance to GDP below 0.25 percentage point of
GDP.

WEO and GFS data for the same selection of
countries. Two major problems arose. First, to
create a sufficiently long time series, various
GFS vintages needed to be spliced together,
leading to situations in which the components
listed above jumped at the splice points, apparently simply because of reclassifications. This
led to spurious measures of fiscal impulses,
taking away the theoretical advantage of using
these data. Second, long time series of GFS
data are available only for central government. This can present a deceptive picture of
changes in fiscal policy. For example, estimates
of fiscal impulses at the central level of government were found to be countercyclical (with
the output cycle) for all countries. This finding
deserves more investigation, but is outside the
scope of this study.

Fiscal Impulse Measures
The elasticity-based fiscal impulse measure
used for the stylized facts, event analysis, and
regressions is a cyclically adjusted primary balance, calculated as
Ytreal
capbt = r t – etP ————,
Yttr–real
where r t is the revenue-to-GDP ratio in period t,
etP is the primary expenditure-to-GDP ratio in
period t, and Ytreal/Yttr–real is real output divided
by potential (trend) output in period t. These
estimates of the cyclically adjusted balance
rely on output gap estimates derived using a
time-series filter, which may not work well when
supply shocks are frequent and large, as for
many emerging economies. Applying the same
elasticities across economies (as assumed for
emerging economies), where one has a low elasticity of taxes to output and another has a high
elasticity of taxes to output could lead to results
implying that the former uses discretionary
fiscal policy more actively than the latter,
whereas in fact the cause is stronger automatic
stabilizers.
The regression-based fiscal impulse measure
used for the regressions is constructed as the

189

Chapter 5   Fiscal Policy as a Countercyclical Tool

difference between a hypothetical primary
deficit in period t assuming no changes in the
economic environment and the actual primary
deficit in period t–1. As a first step, note that
the actual primary balance in period t can be
expressed as a function of the discretionary
policies, Pt, and the economic environment
prevailing in that period, Et:
Bt = B(Pt,Et).
The change in the primary balance with respect
to the previous year can then be decomposed as
follows:
DBt = B(Pt, Et) – B(Pt–1, Et–1)
= [B(Pt, Et) – B(Pt, Et–1)] + [B(Pt, Et–1)
   – B(Pt–1, Et–1)]
= DBtE + DBtP.
The term B(Pt , Et–1) captures what the primary
balance would have been under the period
t policies, assuming the economic environment was the same as in period t–1. It is then
possible to break the change in the balance
into two elements. The first element, DBt E ,
represents the fiscal effects of changes in the
economic ­environment from Et–1 to Et . The
second ­element, DBtP, captures the change in
the balance as a result of changes in discretionary policies.
In practice, the initial step for calculating the
regression-based measure of fiscal impulse is to
estimate the following equations, assuming real
GDP growth is a good proxy for the economic
environment:
Rt = aR + bR · growtht + gR · trendt + ut
Gt = aE + bE · growtht + gE · trendt + et,
where R is general government revenue in percent of GDP, G is general government primary
expenditure in percent of GDP, growth is real
GDP growth, trend is a time trend, and u and
e are residuals. The growth-adjusted revenue,
which indicates what the revenue would have
been in period t if the growth rate remained
unchanged from the previous period, is computed as Rt(growtht–1) = âR + b̂R · growtht–1 +
190

ĝR · trendt + ût. The growth-adjusted primary
expenditure is computed in the same way, as
Gt (growtht–1) = âE + b̂E · growtht–1 + ĝE · trendt + êt.
The measure for the primary balance that would
have prevailed in period t if the growth rate had
been equal to that in period t – 1, B(Pt, Et–1),
can then be calculated as ­Rt(growtht‑‑1) –
Et(growtht–1). The actual primary balance in the
previous period, B(Pt–1, Et–1), is simply Rt–1 – Gt–1.
The final step in the construction of the fiscal impulse measure is to take the difference
between the growth-adjusted measure for the
primary balance in period t and the primary balance in the previous period:
Fiscal impulset = [Rt(growtht–1) – Gt(growtht–1)]
   – [Rt–1 – Gt–1]
= (ĝR – ĝE) + (ût – ût–1)
   – (eˆt – eˆt–1).
Note that although ût and ê t can be expected
to be uncorrelated with yt, ût–1 and eˆt–1 are correlated with yt .

Regression Analysis
Dynamic panel regressions were run using the
Arellano-Bond estimator.38
The multipliers presented in Table 5.4
are derived from regression results shown
in Table 5.6 (using the elasticity-based fiscal
impulse measure) and Table 5.7 (using the
regression-based fiscal impulse measure). Note
that, because it is based on the primary balance,
a negative change in the regression-based measure represents fiscal stimulus, so that a negative
coefficient indicates that fiscal stimulus typically
has a positive effect on real GDP growth. A positive coefficient on the expenditures-only fiscal
impulse or a negative coefficient on the revenue-only fiscal impulse indicate positive effects
on growth.
38Experiments were also run with single-equation
regressions for individual economies. In most cases,
the results were insignificant, indicating that there
was insufficient variation in the short time samples to
adequately differentiate the effects of fiscal stimulus on
output growth.

Divergence of Current Account Balances
across Emerging Economies

This chapter seeks to explain the divergence in current
account behavior between emerging Asia and emerging Europe. It identifies financial liberalization and
EU integration as the main drivers of the large and
persistent deficits in emerging Europe but also raises
concerns about risks of abrupt endings. In contrast,
less open capital accounts and financial sectors
contributed to surpluses in emerging Asia. To a large
extent, however, these surpluses remain unexplained,
raising questions about the role of exchange rates and
the desire of some countries to build high levels of
reserves after the Asian crisis.

T

he pattern of current account balances
across emerging economies has become
much more diverse in recent years than
during the early 1990s, particularly
between emerging Asia and Europe. Most of
emerging Asia (especially after the 1997–98
crisis), the Middle East, and some members of
the Commonwealth of Independent States have
reported large current account surpluses, while
large current account deficits are observed
mainly in emerging Europe and other countries
such as Jordan, Pakistan, South Africa, Turkey,
Vietnam, and a number of countries in Central America and the Caribbean. The current
account deficits in Latin America and Africa
remained on average at modest levels. Notably,
The main authors of this chapter are Stephan Danninger and Florence Jaumotte. Joshua Aizenman and
Christopher Meissner provided consultancy support, and
Stephanie Denis and Patrick Hettinger provided research
assistance. Jonathan Ostry supervised the chapter.
Emerging Asia is defined to include the newly industrialized Asian economies, or NIEs (Korea, Hong Kong
SAR, Singapore, and Taiwan POC), the Asian Tigers
(Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand),
China, and other Asia (India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and
Vietnam). Emerging Europe includes central Europe
(Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovak Republic,
and Slovenia), southeastern Europe (Albania, Bulgaria,
Croatia, Macedonia, FYR, and Romania), and the Baltics
(Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania).

virtually all of these emerging economies have
achieved high growth during the past decade,
irrespective of their current account positions.
The divergent current account patterns in
emerging Asia and Europe have revived the
long-standing debate over the connection
between economic development and capital flows—the Lucas paradox (Lucas, 1990).
Theory predicts that growth should lead to
current account deficits for two reasons. On one
hand, high growth and the resulting profitable investment opportunities should make the
country attractive to foreign capital. On the
other hand, if individuals want to smooth their
consumption over time, prospects of continued
high growth should lead to higher consumption
today because income and consumption can
be expected to rise further in the future. The
traditional view that capital flows downhill to
high-growth countries seems to hold for emerging Europe, whereas the opposite appears to be
the case for emerging Asia after 1997–98.
The two patterns may also have different
implications for macroeconomic stability. The
path of the Asian countries, which combine
rapid growth with current account surpluses,
may seem safer, at least from the point of view
of external vulnerability. However, there may
be limits to how long export-led growth can be
sustained, particularly if it is associated with a
low exchange rate, because of the risks of capital misallocation, overheating, and rising inflation. In contrast, although sustained current
account deficits could fuel overconsumption
and be vulnerable to “sudden stops” in financial
flows, they need not end abruptly if they reflect
consumption smoothing or the financing of
productive investment during episodes of high
The large current account surpluses may, however,
entail a growth and/or welfare cost, but this issue is not

growth, as theory would predict (see, for example, Ghosh and Ostry, 1995, and Ostry, 1997).
Against this background, the chapter looks
more closely at factors underlying the recent
divergence in current account balances across
emerging economies and attempts to assess
their sustainability. The analysis focuses in particular on explaining the divergence between
emerging Asia and emerging Europe and
attempts to answer the following questions:
• What components of the current and financial accounts have driven the recent trends
in the various emerging regions? How have
saving and investment evolved? How does
this experience compare to previous episodes
of growth spurts, including those of currently advanced economies when they were
emerging?
• How can the different growth-current
account configurations in emerging economies be explained? Do they reflect temporary
economic shocks, macroeconomic policies,
or structural factors? For instance, what are
the roles of financial liberalization, barriers
to access to foreign capital, and the exchange
rate?
• Are the current large imbalances atypically
persistent relative to previous spells of current account surpluses and deficits? How long
will they be sustained? Do particular factors
or policies (such as export growth or the
exchange rate regime) contribute to whether
they resolve smoothly or abruptly?
The chapter finds that much of the regional
differences can be explained by structural
factors, while also providing some support for
the traditional view that high growth prospects
attract foreign capital and lower the current
account balance. In emerging Europe, the liberalization of the financial sector and the process
of integration into the EU are the main drivers
of the large current account deficits. In emerg-

ing Asia, structural factors also matter. Low net
capital inflows are linked to the more limited
openness of the capital accounts and financial
sectors, to demographics (younger populations), and to differences in political structures.
However, these factors only partially account for
these economies’ surpluses. The residual current account surpluses are strongly associated
with low exchange rates and large accumulations of reserves. However, it is difficult to establish whether these variables reflect deliberate
policy action or other unidentified fundamental
factors that both raised the current account and
lowered the exchange rate since the Asian crisis
in 1997–98.
The deficits in emerging Europe appear
especially large and persistent relative to
historical episodes, and the protracted surpluses in emerging Asia, such as those in
China and Malaysia, are equally uncommon
among emerging economies. Based on past
experience, the very lengthy deficit episodes
in emerging Europe can be partly explained
by high growth prospects, highly open capital
accounts, financial liberalization, and high
initial net foreign asset positions. In general,
however, the duration of these episodes is
already reaching the upper end of expectations,
raising questions about their sustainability. The
chapter finds that the factors that may cause an
abrupt end to these deficits include the region’s
fixed exchange rate regimes and open capital
accounts.
This chapter is organized as follows. The
next section examines current account patterns
in emerging economies by reviewing developments in the current account, financial account,
and saving-investment balance. The following
section uses empirical evidence to identify the
main economic factors driving these current
account imbalances, again focusing on emerging Europe and emerging Asia. The next section puts the duration of present imbalances in
historical perspective and examines the determinants of the length of imbalance episodes.
The concluding section offers some policy
suggestions.

Recent Current Account Patterns in Emerging Economies

Recent Current Account Patterns in
Emerging Economies
In the mid-1990s the main emerging regions
all ran moderate current account deficits, but
there is now an increasing divergence in current
account balances across emerging regions (Figure 6.1). In particular, emerging Asia is accumulating large and increasing current account
surpluses, on the order of 5 percent of GDP in
2007, whereas emerging Europe is running large
and growing current account deficits reaching
on average 10 percent of GDP in 2007. Most
other country groups (Latin America and a
group consisting of other emerging economies)
are experiencing moderate current account
deficits or small surpluses. Oil exporters are also
running large current account surpluses, but
these are driven by the particular circumstances
of countries that rely on a depletable resource
and are analyzed separately in Box 6.1. Because
their current account positions respond differently to economic determinants, and their
saving and investment behavior is driven by
different considerations (such as the size of
reserves), these countries were omitted from the
empirical analysis below.
Within emerging Asia the pattern is also heterogeneous, with some persistent large surpluses
and a few substantial deficits. The aggregate
surpluses for the region reflect different contributors at different times. In the aftermath of
the Asian crisis, the crisis countries (Korea and
the Asian Tigers) accumulated large surpluses
following the loss of access to international
capital flows and in an effort to rebuild reserves.
More recently (starting around 2002–03), current account surpluses in several of the crisis
countries have come down, with the marked
exception of Malaysia, while China started accumulating large current account surpluses. China
and Malaysia are the only two cases of persistent
large surpluses (see below). By contrast, lowincome countries, such as India, Pakistan, Sri
Lanka, and Vietnam, have mostly been running
deficits, importing capital in accordance with
theory. The three small NIEs (Hong Kong SAR,

The increasing divergence of current account imbalances in emerging economies
is the result of a homogenous shift to longer deficits in emerging Europe and a
more varied transition to surpluses in Asia following the Asian crisis, with initially
large improvements by the Asian Tigers and Korea and more recently large surpluses
in Malaysia and China.

Chapter 6   Divergence of Current Account Balances across Emerging Economies

Box 6.1. Current Account Determinants for Oil-Exporting Countries
The current account surpluses of oil-exporting countries have widened significantly in the
past few years, as oil prices soared. The average
current account of oil exporters increased from
less than 4 percent of GDP to more than 13
percent between 2002 and 2007 (first figure).
During the same period, the sum of the current accounts of those countries increased
from less than $90 billion (0.3 percent of world
GDP) to almost $500 billion (0.9 percent of
world GDP). These surpluses are projected to
increase further in 2008 as a result of the sharp
increase in oil prices.
This box explores the medium-run determinants of the current account balance for oil
exporters and their differences and similarities
to determinants in other countries. It draws
on the so-called macroeconomic balance (MB)
approach, which is based on the equilibrium
relationship between current account balances
and a set of fundamentals (measured, when

relevant, as differences from trading partners’
averages). These fundamentals include variables such as the fiscal balance, demographics,
the oil balance, and economic growth, which
are all robust determinants of the current
account balance (Lee and others, 2008).
Before turning to the regression analysis, it
is useful to highlight three macroeconomic
dimensions along which oil exporters are substantially different from the rest of the world:
• Oil-exporting countries are exposed to
wide fluctuations in their external accounts,
because their exports, by definition, are
relatively undiversified and oil prices fluctuate widely. Such volatility is directly reflected
in the higher volatility of their terms of trade
and current accounts as a percent of GDP
(second figure).
• The fiscal balance in oil-exporting countries
is typically dominated by swings in fiscal
revenues related to oil exports and is hence

very strongly correlated with the current
account as well as being more volatile than
for non-oil-exporters.
• Because oil revenues accrue from the sale of
an exhaustible resource, transfers from one
generation to another play an important
role in ensuring intergenerational equity. 
To avoid sharp decreases in absorption once
oil exports decline, countries aim to accumulate foreign assets and use income from
such assets to offset the decreasing income
from oil. Such transfers are more important
for countries that expect to deplete their
exhaustible resource endowment within a
few decades.
To assess the current account determinants
for exporters of exhaustible resources more
formally, MB-type regressions are estimated
building on the work presented in Lee and
others (2008). Oil exporters are incorporated
in the framework by allowing for (1) the
non-oil fiscal balance as the relevant fiscal
variable, in order to separate the effects of
oil revenues and the non-oil fiscal balance
on the current account; (2) a specific oil-balance coefficient for oil exporters, as well as for
those exporters with more limited reserves,
to capture intergenerational transfers and
the delayed response of consumption and
investment to changes in oil income; and (3)
a specific lagged current account coefficient
for oil exporters, to capture differences in
persistence. The analysis also included tests
for differences in the other coefficients.
There are two important caveats to the
results. First, the quality of historical data
for several oil exporters is problematic—in
particular, the measurement of the non-oil fiscal balance is fraught with difficulties because
the definition of the “oil sector” can differ
across countries. Second, the non-oil sector in
oil exporters may include oil-related activities
(such as petrochemicals and fertilizers). This
may imply a stronger link between the curSee Bems and de Carvalho Filho (forthcoming),
and Thomas, Kim, and Aslam (2008).

tion of Norway, based on a sample spanning
1970–2004, with each observation corresponding to a four-year average. The second and
third columns present results for the entire
sample of countries (with the third column
adding 2005–06 as an additional observation). Estimated coefficients are, in general,
statistically and economically significant and
have expected signs and plausible magnitudes.
Furthermore, the fit of the regression is very
good, especially in light of the fact that fixed
country effects are not included.
Focusing first on those variables that
have similar effects on the current account
balance in both groups of countries, the
estimates imply that the effects of the dependency ratio (ratio of population above age 65
to population between ages 30 and 64), population growth and per capita GDP growth are
statistically and economically indistinguishable across oil exporters and importers. A
higher dependency ratio reduces the current account balance, a 1 percentage point
increase in the population growth rate relative to trading partners lowers the current
account by about 0.7–1.0 percent of GDP, and
a 1 percentage point increase in per capita
GDP growth relative to trading partners lowers the current account by about 0.2 percent
of GDP.
As for the impact of other variables on the
current account, there are statistically and
economically significant differences between
oil exporters and other countries:
• A 1 percentage point improvement in the
(non-oil) fiscal balance leads to a 0.4–0.5 percentage point increase in the current account
balance in percent of GDP for oil exporters,
and to an increase of about 0.15 percentage
point for other countries. This result is consistent with evidence that, in less financially
developed countries, the relationship between
fiscal balance and the current account balance is stronger.
• The current account balance responds
more strongly to the oil balance in oil
exporters than in oil importers. This result

202

is consistent with the notion that, because
oil is an exhaustible resource, the propensity
to save out of an oil price windfall is higher.
Also, oil typically plays a more central
economic role in oil exporters than in oil
importers—as a result, the same oil price
shock implies a larger change in income
for oil exporters. With adjustment costs to
consumption and investment, the response
of the current account to an oil price shock
is likely to be larger for oil exporters, at least
in the short run.
• Among oil exporters, the response of the
current account to the oil balance is stronger
in countries with lower oil and gas reserves
(such as Algeria and Norway), consistent
with the fact that their oil revenues are more
temporary than for other exporters.
• An increase in relative income raises the
current account balance significantly more
in oil-exporting countries than in other
countries—an oil-exporting country with
income half the level in the United States
will have, on average, a current account balance that is 3–4 percentage points of GDP
smaller than that of a country with income
equal to the U.S. level (the difference
is ½–1 percentage point for other countries). A possible interpretation is that, in
countries with volatile relative income and
exhaustible resources, like oil exporters, a
higher fraction of income would be saved in
“good times” (and dissaved in “bad times”)
because shocks to income are more likely to
be temporary.
In conclusion, this preliminary evidence
is broadly consistent with theoretical predictions. Oil-exporting countries are likely to
have large external surpluses, particularly
at times of peaks in production and high oil
prices. This is consistent with the need to
smooth consumption over time and between
generations, in light of the exhaustibleresource nature of oil, as well as with the
partly transitory nature of oil revenue booms
and the presence of adjustment costs to consumption and investment.

Recent Current Account Patterns in Emerging Economies

Singapore, and Taiwan POC) have been running very large current account surpluses, well
above 10 percent of GDP, but they are very much
special cases: all three have high income levels,
and Singapore and Hong Kong SAR are financial centers, pointing to different determinants
for their international capital flows. For the most
part, these economies are omitted from the rest
of the chapter.
In contrast to the Asian experience, the
current account patterns in emerging Europe
are more homogenous and include many large,
persistent imbalances. Deficits are very large
and growing in the Baltics and southeastern
Europe, averaging 18 percent and 11 percent of
GDP in 2007, respectively. The deficits in central Europe have stabilized at more moderate
levels, around 5 percent of GDP on average.
Developments in the current account are
mostly driven by the trade balance (Figure 6.2).
In emerging Asia, the trade surplus accounts for
most of the rise in the current account surplus,
although an increase in net private transfers has
added an extra percentage point to the current account balance since 1997 (mostly in the
Philippines, Vietnam, and Pakistan). Similarly
in emerging Europe, the trade deficit explains
most of the increase in the current account
deficit, with an additional 1½ percentage points
of deficit coming from a recent decline in net
investment income. However, in recent years,
the Czech Republic and Hungary have been
running trade surpluses, with their current
account deficits mostly driven by negative
income balances.
Turning to financial flows, the large surpluses
in emerging Asia have been associated with
large outflows of non-foreign-direct-investment
(non-FDI) capital and an unprecedented accumulation of reserves. Reserves have now reached
39 percent of GDP and cover 9.2 months of
imports. A by-product of the large accumulation of reserves in emerging Asia and the
oil-producing countries has been the creation
of large sovereign wealth funds (SWFs), which
has potentially important implications for global
capital flows and asset prices (Box 6.2). Emerg-

Developments in the current account are mostly driven by the trade balance.
In emerging Asia the current transfer balance also improved after 1997,

deterioration of the net income balance.

Chapter 6   Divergence of Current Account Balances across Emerging Economies

Box 6.2. Sovereign Wealth Funds: Implications for Global Financial Markets
This box discusses how large, persistent current account surpluses in several, mostly emerging, economies have resulted in sovereign wealth
funds (SWFs) becoming key players in the global
financial landscape (first figure). It also examines the possible impact of the growing role of
SWFs on global capital flows, key asset prices,
and financial markets more broadly.
Although many SWFs have been around for
many years, if not decades, there has been a
sharp increase since 2000 in the number of SWFs
and in the assets estimated to be under their
management. The growing presence of SWFs is
a result of sustained large current account surpluses in several Asian economies and oil-exporting countries. These surpluses—reflecting high
commodity prices and favorable trade balances—
have translated into a rapid accumulation of
foreign reserves by central banks. Reserves have
reached a level that many countries have come
to believe provides a sufficient cushion against
financial or economic shocks. Although many of
these countries still have enormous development
needs, their absorptive capacity is limited. Therefore, quickly spending the oil- or export-related
revenues may be inappropriate or unfeasible.
Moreover, there is a growing sense that turning
“resources in the ground” into financial assets
is an important channel for transferring wealth
across generations.
As a result, many countries are seeking to
enhance the returns on these large pools of
funds. Rather than continuing to invest conservatively through sustained reserve accumulation, they are transferring these assets to SWFs
with broader and more aggressive investment
mandates. Estimates by market participants
suggest that assets under management of SWFs
range from $2 to $3 trillion—exceeding assets
managed by hedge funds ($1.9 trillion)—and
account for about one-fourth to one-third of
foreign assets held by sovereigns. Although
SWF assets remain small relative to total global

financial assets (about $190 trillion), they are
large relative to mature market stock capitalization and the size of debt and capital markets
in emerging economies. That said, part of
SWFs’ portfolios is often invested in nonfinancial assets, such as real estate. SWF assets are
projected to surpass the stock of global foreign
exchange reserves in the not-so-distant future
and to top $7 to $11 trillion by 2013. Thus it is
clear that SWFs will play an increasingly prominent role in global finance.
Against this background, a key concern is the
impact of the growing presence of SWFs on the
pattern of global capital flows, asset prices, and
financial stability more generally. SWFs typically
have medium- to long-term investment horizons, suggesting that they are less likely to make
abrupt portfolio shifts that could affect market
stability. Indeed, during the current financial
market turmoil, SWFs have made large capital
injections into systemically important financial
institutions, suggesting that SWFs can play a
stabilizing role in global financial markets. Yet

Recent Current Account Patterns in Emerging Economies

even a gradual shift toward greater portfolio
diversification of reserve assets by sovereigns,
including through SWFs, could have implications for the flow of funds between countries,
the absolute and relative price of assets, and the
evolution of global imbalances.
Analyzing the potential impact of a diversification of sovereign reserves through SWFs
is challenging because of the lack of reliable
information for several large SWFs, notably concerning their asset allocations. To examine the
possible implications of the growing presence
of SWFs, illustrative scenarios of asset allocation
were constructed for countries that are in the
process of shifting away from holding reserves
and toward diversifying their assets through
SWFs., Two stylized, diversified portfolios—one
replicating that of Norway’s Government Pension Fund (GPF-Global) and the other representative of well‑established SWFs—are calibrated
and compared with a stylized portfolio of

Foreign

official investors are estimated to have kept
10-year U.S. Treasury nominal yields 100 basis points
lower than otherwise (Warnock and Warnock, 2006).
The analysis assumes that countries that have
recently established SWFs or have announced their
intention to do so will channel a portion of their prospective foreign exchange inflows to their respective
SWFs. Countries that have recently established or are
in the process of establishing SWFs or SWF-type investment funds include Brazil, China, Korea, Russia, and
Saudi Arabia; those that are considering the establishment of SWFs (according to market reports) include
India, Japan, and Thailand.
The new flows are calculated as the sum of each
country’s current account balance and net private
capital flows, based on World Economic Outlook projections for 2008–13. The analysis provides for a lower
bound—which assumes that countries with recently
established SWFs will invest 50 percent of newly available foreign currency inflows in their SWFs; and an
upper bound—which assumes that in addition, countries that are considering establishing SWFs (based on
market reports) invest 50 percent of newly available
foreign currency inflows in their SWFs. The upper
bound also assumes that 10 percent of the stock of
existing reserves of the top 10 emerging economy
reserve holders is shifted from reserves to SWF holdings during 2008–13. It is assumed that all new flows
into SWFs are invested abroad.

foreign exchange reserve assets, with a view to
assessing likely changes in the pattern of global
capital flows and the impact on asset prices
(second figure). To complement this scenario
analysis, the exercise also estimates the impact
of a modest shift away from dollar assets in
the current stock of reserves for the 10 largest emerging economy reserve holders. A note
of caution is warranted. As in many modeling
exercises, the results are highly sensitive to
the underlying assumptions. For instance, by
assuming no portfolio shifts for long-established
SWFs, the exercise provides only a partial picture of the possible magnitude of the impact on
capital flows and asset prices arising from possible diversification strategies. Moreover, other
sovereigns may choose to diversify their existing
stock of reserve assets (and not just the top 10
emerging market reserve holders as assumed in
the exercise). Finally, while the two stylized portfolios aim to capture possible asset-allocation
strategies, it must be recognized that in practice,
SWFs are a diverse group with differing mandates, transparency, and governance structures.
Even so, this limited exercise provides a sense
of the direction and magnitude of the possible
impact on markets.
The analysis suggests that the pattern of
global capital flows would change significantly,
with advanced economies facing lower capital
inflows and emerging economies attracting
substantially larger inflows (third figure). Relative to reserve assets, which are predominantly
dollar-denominated and generally held in the
form of U.S. Treasury bills or agency securities,
the stylized SWF portfolios are more diversified

stylized portfolio of a representative diversified SWF is based on market reports concerning
asset allocation and currency composition. Currency

(COFER) is an IMF database that records end-ofperiod quarterly data on the currency composition of
official foreign exchange reserves. Aggregate COFER
data are used to derive a stylized reserves portfolio,
assuming that assets are allocated exclusively toward
government bonds, according to the COFER currency

across both asset classes and currency exposure.
This suggests reduced inflows into government
bond markets, with attendant implications for
interest rates. The shift away from reserve assets
could have the most significant effect on markets in the United States, if countries diversify
away from dollar holdings.
• Estimates show that inflows into the United
States could decline by ½–1 percent of U.S.
GDP a year on average, depending on the number of countries in the sample and the assumption made regarding the currency composition
of reserves for the 10 largest emerging economy
reserve holders. The results also hinge on the
asset-allocation strategy that is used to model
investments by the prospective SWFs.
• Portfolios that are more weighted to emerging economies—such as the stylized diversified portfolio—would result in lower flows
into both dollar and euro assets, whereas
flows to emerging economies would tend to
increase substantially. By contrast, a portfolio
similar to Norway’s SWF—which is heavily
weighted toward investments in Europe—
would suggest somewhat lower investment in
dollar assets and a less sizable, but still positive, inflow to emerging markets.
• To quantify the implications of the potential
changes in the pattern of capital flows on
interest rates and exchange rates relative to
the baseline, simulations were undertaken
using the IMF’s GIMF5 model. The results

ing Asia remains a net importer of FDI, but net
FDI inflows (in percent of GDP) are small compared with inflows to emerging economies in
other regions, and they have not changed much
since the beginning of the 1990s. In emerging
Europe, the increasing current account deficits are covered to a large extent by net FDI, a
relatively stable source of financing, although

focus on the effects for the United States.
They point to a 10–25 basis point increase
in U.S. real interest rates and a 2–4 percent
depreciation of the U.S. dollar in the long
run. The model does predict a sharper
depreciation of the dollar in the short run,
of some 6–10 percent. The U.S. current
account deficit could improve by ½–1 percentage point of U.S. GDP, a consequence
of a higher country risk premium driven by
lower demand for U.S. assets. In the rest of
the world, higher capital inflows would lead
to lower real interest rates (and thus a larger
interest rate differential with the United
States) and more appreciated currencies (in
real effective terms), and domestic demand
would be boosted.
The model estimates do not suggest a disorderly depreciation of the U.S. dollar, nor a
disorderly unwinding of global imbalances. In
fact, they suggest that the effect of gradual portfolio shifts would be modest in the long run.
However, the model estimates do not take into
account possible second-round effects, as other
investors react to the change in the behavior
of SWFs. Overall, the results suggest that lower
demand for U.S. assets would help lower the
U.S. current account deficit and lower the value
of the dollar.

Laxton (2007).

increases in deficits have outpaced net FDI during the past few years. Emerging Europe is also
a large importer of non-FDI capital, including
both bond-related and equity inflows. Overall
reserves have accumulated at a rate of 2–3 percent of GDP a year.
Another way to understand changes in the
current account balance is to look at develop-

In Asia saving and investment declined after 1997, the latter abruptly in the Tigers.
Although investment remained below pre-crisis levels, saving and investment were
driven up recently by increases in China, India, and others. In contrast, investment
grew rapidly in emerging Europe, especially in the lower-income countries, and
was coupled with modest gains in saving.

ments in saving and investment (Figures 6.3 and
6.4). In emerging Asia, the 1997–98 crisis led to
a drastic drop in (mostly) private investment in
Korea and the Asian Tigers. Saving also declined,
especially public saving, but the decline was
much smaller. In contrast, the rising surplus in
China during the latter period (2003–06) was
driven by a large rebound in private (mostly
corporate) saving and a continued increase in
public saving. Private and public investment
also increased, although by smaller amounts. In
emerging Europe, the current account deficits
reflected a surge in private investment (mirroring a rise in FDI) and, to a lesser extent,
in public investment, especially in the Baltics
and southeastern Europe. Public saving also
increased modestly in these countries (with the
exception of central Europe), whereas private
saving was relatively flat. As in emerging Asia,
household dissaving has been offset by increased
corporate saving, although in recent years, there
has been some private dissaving on net.
Compared with other episodes of growth
takeoffs, recent current account deficits in
emerging Europe are quite large (Figure 6.5).
Economies that experienced a growth takeoff at
some point during the past 35 years had current
account deficits of about 3 percent of GDP on
average during the first eight years following the
growth takeoff, compared with deficits averaging
6–7 percent of GDP in emerging Europe over
the equivalent period. A similar pattern, albeit
with a smaller difference, was also observed during the growth takeoffs of a number of countries
The

current account balance is the difference between
national savings and gross investment.
An argument that has been advanced to explain
China’s surplus is a high household saving rate, reflecting
the lack of social safety nets or habit-based consumption.
However, the recent rise in China’s current account was
associated with an increase in the corporate saving rate
and not the household saving rate. Aziz and Cui (2007)
argue that a declining labor income share—rather than
an increasing household saving rate—has been the main
factor behind the declining consumption share of GDP
in China.
Appendix 6.1 presents in more detail the criteria used
to identify growth takeoffs and the countries and years
during which these occurred.

Recent Current Account Patterns in Emerging Economies

in emerging Asia, with the exception of China.
In general, across growth takeoffs, the deepening of the current account deficit was associated
with a surge in investment and a small offsetting
increase in saving. By comparison, the takeoff in
emerging Europe brought a larger acceleration
in investment, an experience matched previously only by the takeoffs in the Asian Tigers
during the early 1970s. Where emerging Europe
stands out from the typical growth takeoff is with
respect to the larger net inflows of FDI and the
longer duration of deficit episodes.
Interestingly, the growth takeoffs identified
here include a number of western European
countries with earlier EU entry. These also experienced substantial current account deficits and
net inflows of FDI, but on a much smaller scale
than emerging Europe. This could partly reflect
the fact that their capital accounts were only
fully opened in the early 1990s, in most cases
after their growth takeoffs.
The current account reversals in emerging
Asia during the 1997–98 crisis also stand out
relative to experiences in other crisis episodes.
Compared with currency and banking crises that
occurred since 1980, emerging Asian economies
started from bigger deficits on average, and the
adjustments in their current accounts and investment levels were much larger and much more
abrupt (Figure 6.6). Part of these large reversals
were subsequently undone. However, five years
after the crisis, surpluses remained higher than
in the aftermath of other crisis episodes.
One common characteristic of both emerging Asian and emerging European economies
is their high growth rates. Figure 6.7 suggests,
consistent with theory, that among high-growth
countries (that is, with growth in per capita
GDP above 2 percent a year), those countries
with higher growth rates tend to have lower
current account balances. This negative correlation holds true across all economies, but also

Outlook.

Figure 6.4. Saving and Investment by Components1

The emergence of a large current account surplus in China in recent years is the
result of a sharp increase in corporate saving. Household saving declined in both
regions throughout the past decade and is especially low in emerging Europe.

within each emerging region (China is again a
clear exception). The available evidence about
current account developments in the advanced
economies when they were emerging in the late
19th and early 20th centuries indicates that capital flowed to high-growth countries (Box 6.3).

What Factors Have Contributed to Recent
Current Account Patterns?
The current account balances of emerging
economies are affected by multiple factors.10
This section looks closely at cross-country data
relating the level of the current account balance
to a broad set of variables that may be important
in determining the current account balances
of emerging Europe and emerging Asia. The
empirical analysis first attempts to explain the
current account developments solely based on
standard factors that have been highlighted
in the literature as important determinants of
current account balances. These determinants
include the government balance, youth and
old-age dependency ratios, the net foreign asset
position, and growth opportunities proxied by
the initial income level and lagged growth.11
This

finding holds also if all emerging economies are
included rather than only high-growth emerging economies. Excluding China, capital was flowing in aggregate
to emerging economies. This evidence contrasts with the
recent literature, which has found a positive correlation between growth and the current account (see, for
instance, Prasad, Rajan, and Subramanian, 2007; and
Gourinchas and Jeanne, 2007). One possible explanation
is that many of these studies do not include countries of
emerging Europe and include a large number of African
countries, for which most capital inflows are official aid
inflows and not private capital inflows driven by market
considerations. Recent research suggests that aid inflows
can have an ambiguous or even negative impact on
growth by raising the exchange rate and curbing growth
prospects for the tradables sector (see, for example,
Rajan and Subramanian, 2005).
10See for instance, Aristovnik (2006), Chinn and Ito
(2006), Gruber and Kamin (2007, 2008), and Herrmann
and Jochem (2005).
11See Lee and others (2008). Growth opportunities are
expected to lower the current account through higher
investment and lower saving. Similarly, high dependency
ratios will lower the current account by lowering saving.
In contrast, a government surplus will raise the current

What Factors Have Contributed to Recent Current Account Patterns?

These variables explain a large share of current
account patterns worldwide, but they are not
able to account for the large surpluses in emerging Asia and the large deficits in emerging
Europe. The empirical analysis then augments
these standard factors with a set of additional
variables that characterize financial sector developments that may have played a key role driving
current account patterns during recent years.
Over the past 10 years, economies in emerging Europe have very rapidly liberalized their
domestic financial systems and opened up their
capital accounts (Figure 6.8).12 The combination of these two liberalizations was reflected in
a surge in the number of foreign banks in these
countries.13 Although emerging Asia also made
some progress toward domestic financial liberalization, the financial systems of these economies
remain much less liberal, with the exception
of the NIEs. During the Asian crisis, the Asian
Tigers and the NIEs also introduced restrictions on capital account transactions. More than
10 years later, capital accounts remain generally
account if it is not fully offset by a decrease in private
saving and/or a rise in private investment. Finally, higher
net foreign assets are expected to raise the current
account by increasing net investment income. The analysis also includes a dummy variable for financial centers
as these typically export capital, the oil balance, and time
effects to capture developments that affect similarly all
countries in a given time period.
12This chapter uses an index of domestic financial
liberalization that combines information on interest rate
controls, credit controls, competition restrictions, state
ownership, quality of the banking supervision and regulation, policies to encourage the development of bond and
equity markets, and policies to permit access by foreigners to the domestic stock market (Abiad, Detragiache,
and Tressel, forthcoming). The capital account openness
index is from Chinn and Ito (2006). These two indices
are highly correlated, in part because domestic financial
liberalization includes a measure of entry barriers to foreign investors. The significance of these variables is thus
tested jointly in the regressions.
13Another reason for the increase in foreign bank
ownership is comparatively better growth opportunities
for parent banks, which face tighter income conditions in
their home markets. Ayden (forthcoming) finds that tight
spreads—the difference between lending and deposit
rates—for parent banks in their home markets are associated with an increase of lending by their subsidiaries
operating in central and eastern Europe.

very closed in these economies, with the exception of the NIEs.
Theory does not provide clear guidance on
the sign of the net effect of financial sector
liberalization and capital account openness
on the current account. A more open capital
account and a more developed financial system
are likely to improve access to foreign capital
for financing domestic investment, thereby
lowering the current account.14 However, a
more liberalized domestic financial system with
greater intermediation opportunities may also
encourage domestic saving, with an opposite
effect on the current account. On the other
hand, domestic financial liberalization can also
imply better access to credit and new financial
products, which tends to reduce both domestic
saving and the current account. Hence, the net
effect of financial sector liberalization and capital account openness on the current account is
uncertain and remains an empirical question.
Another financial factor that may affect the
current account is the financial depth of the
economy, measured by the share of credit to
the private sector and stock market capitalization in GDP.15 Greater financial depth could be
a sign of a developed financial system, which
would raise the current account if it stimulated
domestic saving but could lower the current
account if it attracts more foreign savings and
thereby fuels domestic investment. Financial
depth appears much greater in emerging Asia
than in emerging Europe, although it has been
increasing in both regions (with the exception
of the Asian Tigers).
A factor that has received a lot of attention
in the context of the Asian current account
surpluses is exchange rate policy and preferences for accumulating reserves. However, it
is difficult to find an exogenous measure of
these policies, because the exchange rate and
14In case of a crisis or if the country is not well managed, a more open capital account could also be associated with more capital outflows.
15See Chinn and Prasad (2003), Gruber and Kamin
(2007, 2008), and Chinn and Ito (2006) for analyses that
include this measure (and capital account openness).

212

What Factors Have Contributed to Recent Current Account Patterns?

reserves are simultaneously determined with the
current account balance. Hence, these factors
are not part of this formal analysis, although
some evidence is provided about their potential
role in determining the size of emerging Asia’s
surpluses. Finally, the exchange rate regime
itself (fixed versus flexible) could also affect the
current account balance, with fixed exchange
rate regimes potentially leading to (temporarily) larger imbalances in response to economic
shocks. However, the direction of the effect is
unclear, depending on the nature of the initial
shock to the current account balance.

Empirical Analysis
The empirical analysis focuses on determinants of the medium-run current account
balance (averaging data over four-year periods)
and covers a panel of 58 (non-oil-exporting)
advanced and emerging economies during
1983–2006, including emerging Europe for the
subperiod 1995–2006 (for data quality reasons;
see Appendix 6.2 for more details).16 It starts
by estimating a standard model of the current
account and then augments it with a set of
financial variables and a measure of political
structure.17 Finally, special factors that have
affected emerging Europe are introduced to
reflect their specific circumstances.18

16The

panel is unbalanced as the variables were not
always available for all subperiods for all countries.
17The political structure index is the “Polity2” variable
from the Polity IV Project (Marshall, Jaggers, and Gurr,
2004). It covers a number of dimensions, including the
presence of institutions and procedures through which
citizens can express effective preferences about alternative
policies and leaders and the existence of institutionalized
constraints on the exercise of power by the executive.
18First, since the collapse of the Council for Mutual
Economic Assistance (COMECON), most of these countries embarked on a process of EU integration involving
greater macroeconomic stability and improved policies.
Hence, progress toward EU integration may have given
these countries privileged access to foreign capital.
Second, investment needs in emerging Europe may have
been especially large as the collapse of the COMECON
led to a substantial depreciation of capital stocks while
the labor force is well educated.

Figure 6.8. Patterns of Financial Development1
In emerging Europe domestic financial market liberalization proceeded faster than in
emerging Asia (except for the newly industrialized Asian economies (NIEs), which
were already at a more advanced stage). The opening up of capital accounts was
associated with a rapid influx of foreign banks.

Ratio of British capital inflows to
GDP in receiving country2

The global economy experienced a golden
age of integration from the middle of the 19th
century until World War I. Numerous factors
underpinned the changes: better communications due to the diffusion of the telegraph and
the railroad, massive declines in shipping costs,
unparalleled mass migrations, the spread of the
gold standard, the consolidation of the British Empire, and increasing sophistication of
London’s financial markets. The largest supplier
of funds was Great Britain, which accounted for
well over 50 percent of all capital outflows from
the surplus countries. Other capital exporters
were France, Germany, and the Netherlands.
Controls on inflows had yet to be established.
And investors were largely left alone to decide
where to send their capital, although in some
cases political aims in the surplus countries
determined the direction of capital flows. The
panels of the figure show the current account
for surplus countries (or gross capital outflows)
between 1870 and 1913 and for the principal
capital importers: Argentina, Australia, Canada,
and the United States (see Stone, 1999).
Capital inflows were often very persistent. Many
of the important capital-importing countries
sustained current account deficits for a decade or
longer. Other countries that were on more fragile
financial footing experienced more short-lived
deficits. Meissner and Taylor (2006) estimate that
extensive capital importers, such as Argentina,
Australia, Canada, and the United States, sustained
deficits for long periods, with half-lives for current
account deficits of about three years compared
with half-lives of roughly three-fourths of a year in

Determinants of Capital Flows

Sustainability of Capital Flows and Financial Crises

Argentina, Australia, Canada, and the United
States were the main recipients of British capital
flows. Capital from France and Germany went
primarily to Russia, Turkey, and other European countries. Recent research by Clemens
and Williamson (2004) on the motivations for
British capital outflows finds that long-term
growth prospects mattered most to investors.
Capital was most likely to flow toward areas with
high population growth rates and high rates of
net immigration, areas that focused on exports
of commodities based on significant natural
resource endowments, and where the population was better educated (see bottom figure
panels). Imperial relations, default history, and
monetary stability were additional factors that
accounted for a small fraction of the observed
inflows. Similar economic motivations also
played a dominant role for other capital exporters, such as Germany (Esteves, 2008).
In the major recipients such as Canada,
Argentina, and Australia, inflows supplemented
low rates of domestic saving. Investment was
predominantly directed toward key infrastructure projects (railroads, harbors, municipal
services) and helped raise productive capacity. Countries with smaller inflows tended to
use foreign capital for consumption purposes
and to supplement or smooth low government
revenues. Many of these countries also had

Some of these large capital inflows ended
abruptly with financial crises that temporarily brought growth below long-run trend rates
(Catão, 2007). Bordo, Cavallo, and Meissner
(2007) show that sudden stops or turnarounds
in capital flows are associated with previously
high levels of capital inflows and foreign currency exposure. By contrast, strong reserve positions, high export growth, and close political
ties with the lender lower the likelihood of a
sudden stop in capital inflows in any given year.
In particular, larger borrowers with financial
credibility or ties to the British Empire (such
as Canada) were able to sustain capital inflows
even at times of low international liquidity.
Experiences after a crisis differ significantly,
but were more severe in less open economies
and in countries with underdeveloped financial
sectors. The experiences of Argentina and Australia in the early 1890s exemplify this. Argentina had a major banking, currency, and debt
crisis in 1890 known as the Baring crisis. Default
settlement was not concluded for several years,
and a weak financial system and low credibility
with international investors suppressed foreign
investment for another decade. Around the
same time, Australia also had a major banking
crisis that lasted for several years. Nevertheless,
the component colonies never defaulted on
their external obligations, and their credibility as
borrowers helped them avoid a currency crisis.

This finding challenges a long-held conviction that
French and German capital flows were significantly
determined by the political exigencies of Paris or
Berlin.
Investors in the first wave of globalization used
many public sources to gain information about the
quality of their investments. The Fenn on the Funds
investors’ manual provided short excerpts from past
bond prospectuses for each and every sovereign
borrower on the London market. Examples of such
excerpts from countries that borrowed to plug revenue gaps or to fund costly wars included Russia (an
issue to strengthen the special reserve fund), Japan
(to pay charges on pensions), Egypt (Pasha loan for

repayment of existing debt), and Austria (an issue in
1851 to improve the value of the paper florin).
The crisis started because of overly optimistic
investment by the Baring Brothers Bank based in
London, but it also witnessed an early credit boom
generated by a small and poorly regulated domestic
banking sector. It ended with a major banking crisis, a
currency crash, and a debt default.
The crisis in Australia was triggered by a drought,
coupled with an earlier credit boom.
Australia did not issue its own currency at that
time, but private bank notes were allowed to become

Box 6.3 (concluded)
Although the Australian economy recovered
only slowly, a rise in domestic saving was able to
repay previous debts and stimulate investment.
Conclusions
The period between 1870 and 1913 witnessed
historically unprecedented levels of international capital flows. These flows were often

legal tender during the crisis.

The standard model fits the data well overall
but explains only a small part of the pattern
of current account balances in emerging Asia
and emerging Europe (Table 6.1, column a).19
In emerging Asia for the subperiod 2003–06, it
would predict a current account balance below
the sample average by 1.4 percentage points of
GDP, whereas the current account balance was
actually above the sample average by 3.3 percentage points.20 Similarly, in emerging Europe,
the model would predict a current account balance only moderately below the sample average,
by 1.8 percentage points of GDP, whereas the
actual current account balance over the subperiod 2003–06 was 7.4 percentage points of GDP
below the sample average.
The preferred model, including the financial
factors and special effects for emerging Europe,
has a much better fit, especially for emerging
Europe.21 Based on the preferred model (shown
in column e of Table 6.1), the main contributing
factors to the large deficits in emerging Europe
have been the financial variables, accounting
19The dummy variables for post-crisis emerging Asia and
emerging Europe remain large and highly significant.
20This calculation is based on the final model reported
in column e of Table 6.1 and sums the contributions of
the standard structural factors.

dummy variable for emerging Asia in the aftermath of
the 1997–98 crisis.

long-lasting and financed key infrastructure
projects in many large and credible borrowing
countries. They were for the most part driven
by the desire of investors in industrial countries
to invest in fast-growing countries with strong
growth prospects, and there were no examples
of capital flowing uphill. There were several
episodes of disastrous financial crises, in the
wake of sudden stops of capital, especially when
financial development was weak and countries
were less open to trade.

for 4.6 percentage points (about 60 percent)
of the 7.4 percentage point deficit (deviation
from sample average) (Figure 6.9). Among these
variables, domestic financial liberalization is the
factor with the largest impact by far.22 Growth
opportunities—defined as the scope for convergence through a low initial per capita income
level and a high recent growth performance—
contributed a further percentage point to the
deficit. Other minor factors included low net
foreign assets, the fiscal balance, and a negative
oil balance. After allowing for special European
effects (described below), the unexplained
residual for the region as a whole is less than
half a percentage point.
In emerging Asia, structural factors are found
to have helped raise the current account, but
the impact is offset by other factors (in particular high growth opportunities). Thus, about
75 percent of the current account surplus
remains unexplained. Structural factors that
have contributed to the current account surplus
include the lack of financial liberalization,
younger populations, and lower values for the
22The

effect of domestic financial liberalization also
captures the removal of entry barriers to foreign capital.
The high openness of the capital account also lowers
the current account, as does the relatively low level of
financial development in emerging Europe (presumably
by depressing saving). However, the magnitudes of these
two other effects are very small.

political structure index, with respective contributions at 1.6, 0.9, and 0.6 points. These factors
were partly offset by high growth opportunities,
which contributed to lower the current account
balance by 1.8 points, and a negative oil balance
(as well as a number of other minor factors).
The decomposition of the change in current
accounts over time reveals a similar picture:
financial liberalization and growth opportunities
largely explain the widening of current account
deficits in emerging Europe, but the increase in
the current account surplus in emerging Asia
remains largely unexplained. For both regions,
developments in the rest of the world contributed to raise the current account balance.

The current account deficits of emerging Europe are mainly explained by financial
factors, whereas a large portion of the surpluses in Asia remains unexplained by

What are the special factors at work in emerging Europe? To explore this, the preferred
model allows for separate regression coefficients
for emerging Europe, thereby reducing the
emerging Europe dummy to zero (see Table 6.1,
column c). The main differentiated effects stem
from the fiscal balance and financial liberalization. First, financial liberalization is found to
have a more pronounced impact on current
account balances in emerging Europe than in
the rest of the sample. Therefore, the large
contribution of financial liberalization to the
current account deficits in emerging Europe
reflects both a higher level of financial liberalization and a more pronounced impact on the
current account of a given degree of financial
liberalization. Second, although a government
surplus raises the current account for the sample as a whole (although not very significantly in
a statistical sense), it lowers the current account
in emerging Europe.
One possible explanation for these differentiated effects is the process of EU integration that most countries in emerging Europe
undertook after the collapse of their trade ties
with the former Soviet Union.23 EU integration
23See Herrmann and Winkler (2008) for a discussion
of the role of European economic integration in current

218

What Factors Have Contributed to Recent Current Account Patterns?

was a major factor behind financial liberalization, as reflected in the large and rising western
European ownership of banks in the region.
Progress toward EU integration also involved
greater fiscal discipline—one of the Maastricht
criteria—which may have given these countries
privileged access to foreign capital by signaling
greater macroeconomic stability and improved
policies. In order to test this hypothesis, a measure of the degree of European integration is
built as a score for achieving different stages of
the formal integration process, namely EU membership application, initiation of negotiation for
EU membership, EU accession, entry into ERM
II, and euro adoption.
Interacting the government balance variable with this measure of progress toward EU
integration supports this interpretation: the
negative impact of a fiscal surplus on the current account is stronger the closer the country
is to EU accession (it makes the interaction
with the simple dummy variable for emerging
Europe insignificant) (see Table 6.1, column d).
A smaller government deficit provides confidence to foreign investors of progress toward
EU accession and lowers the risk premium as
the integration process advances.24 The divergent fiscal performance between the Baltics and
southeastern Europe, which have improved their
fiscal position, and central Europe, where the
fiscal position has deteriorated, explains much
of the current account variation within emerging Europe (Figure 6.10).25
In contrast, the differentiated effect of financial liberalization on the current account balance of emerging Europe is not directly related
to the institutional measure of European inteaccount deficits in emerging Europe. As in this analysis,
they identify region-specific effects that have led to the
emergence of what they refer to as “convergence clubs.”
24Another possible explanation is a procyclical response
of the fiscal balance to the economic boom fueled by
foreign capital inflows, which may be especially large in
emerging Europe.
25Because opposite fiscal developments occurred in
the various subregions of emerging Europe, this factor is
however not a main contributor to the aggregate deficit
position of emerging Europe.

Results by Subregion1

gration. However, there is some evidence that
the broad entry of foreign banks, which characterized the process of financial liberalization
in these countries, may account for the more
pronounced impact on the current account,
because foreign banks may have drawn more
foreign capital with them and, more generally,
may have facilitated better access to foreign
capital (see Appendix 6.2).26

Explaining the Residual Current Account Surplus
in Emerging Asia
Although the model achieves some success
in explaining the current account deficits of
emerging Europe with structural factors, in
particular domestic financial liberalization, the
surpluses in post-crisis emerging Asia remain
largely unexplained, even after augmenting
standard structural factors by financial variables.27 Within emerging Asia, most of the
structural factors, including growth opportunities, financial liberalization, political structure,
and demography, had a similar impact on the
current account balances of the various subregions, though they had a somewhat larger
impact on China’s current account balance
(see Figure 6.10). However, a large fraction of

26Abiad, Leigh, and Mody (2007) find that financial
integration played an important role in explaining the
current account deficits in emerging Europe. Herrmann
and Winkler (2008) also find evidence that the presence
of foreign banks was an important contributor in explaining the difference between the current account balances
of emerging Asia and emerging Europe. Mihaljek (2007)
finds that foreign banks played an important role in the
rising credit growth in central and eastern European
economies by introducing new products, improving financial sector efficiency, and strengthening risk management.
27Additional variables were tested but were not statistically significant. These included the share of employment
in agriculture and the productivity differential between
agriculture and the rest of the economy (to capture the
large pool of underemployed labor in emerging Asia),
the share of subsidies and social transfers in GDP (as a
proxy for social safety nets), an index of terms of trade
and the standard deviation of this index (as a motive for
precautionary saving), a measure of trade openness, the
exchange rate regime, and a variable indicating the start
of banking crises.

220

the current account surplus in the Asian Tigers
(including Korea) and, to a lesser extent, in
China is left unexplained by the structural factors. One factor often mentioned to explain the
large surpluses in emerging Asia is the valuation
of exchange rates. A measure of the deviation of
the real effective exchange rate from its predicted level suggests that, since the Asian crisis,
the Asian Tigers and China have had declining
or low exchange rates relative to the predicted
levels, although some correction has taken place
since 2003 (Figure 6.11).28 Low-income Asian
countries, on the other hand, have had low but
appreciating exchange rates during most of
the period. Various reasons for the low and/or
declining exchange rates have been advanced,
such as a desire to accumulate large reserves for
precautionary motives, which may have been
relevant for the crisis countries for some time
following the Asian crisis, and a growth model
based on exports (Aizenman, 2006, 2007; Becker
and others, 2007; Cheung and Qian, 2007; and
Jeanne, 2007).29
There is a clear negative correlation between
the unexplained component of the current
28The

real effective exchange rate deviation is based on
the equilibrium real exchange rate approach developed
as part of the IMF Consultative Group on Exchange
Rate Issues (CGER) assessment and is calculated as the
residual from a regression of the consumer price index
(CPI)-based real effective exchange rate on the productivity differential between tradables and nontradables
(to capture the Balassa-Samuelson effect), other factors
affecting relative prices (government consumption, trade
restriction index, price controls, and commodity terms of
trade), and net foreign assets (see Lee and others, 2008).
The advantage of using the residual from the equilibrium
real exchange rate approach is that, unlike a quantitybased measure of deviation from equilibrium, it does not
use information about the size of the current account.
29Cheung and Qian (2007) find evidence of competitive hoarding of reserves in emerging Asia aimed at
preventing a real exchange rate appreciation and hence
a loss in competitiveness. Controlling for conventional
variables, they estimate that a $1 increase in international reserves by one country has been associated with
an increase of about $0.6 by the other countries in the
region. Zhang (forthcoming) argues that the increase
in the Chinese current account and, in particular, in
corporate saving partly reflects disguised capital inflows
(through over-invoicing for exports) in anticipation of an
appreciation of the currency.

account balance—after structural factors have
been taken into account—and the deviation
of the exchange rate from its predicted level,
suggesting that a low exchange rate is associated with a higher current account balance
(Figure 6.12).30 There is also a positive but
weaker correlation between the stock of reserves
(a proxy of preferences for reserve accumulation) and the current account balance. A simple
regression (not shown) confirms that the deviation of the exchange rate from its predicted
level and (to a lesser extent) the high stock of
reserves cut the unexplained current account
surplus in emerging Asia in half, to about 1
percentage point of GDP.
However, such simple regressions do not give
reliable results on causality because the deviation of the exchange rate from its predicted
value is not truly exogenous, but is rather jointly
determined with the current account. Therefore, it is hard to discern whether the low and/
or declining exchange rates in emerging Asia
were the result of deliberate policy action or the
endogenous outcome of unidentified fundamental factors which are omitted from the current
account model and which impacted both the
current account and the exchange rate. An
exogenous measure of exchange rate policy is
difficult to obtain.

Exchange Rates1

Relative to predicted levels, exchange rates in emerging Asia were undervalued
in recent years, while they were overvalued in emerging Europe. More recently,
exchange rates returned to equilibrium levels in central Europe, while the
deviation from predicted levels increased in the Baltics.

Sustainability of Current Account
Imbalances
The large and long-lasting current account
imbalances in emerging Europe and emerging
Asia prompt two questions: How long can these
imbalances be sustained? And are they likely to
end abruptly or be resolved smoothly? The current account deficits of emerging Europe can
largely be explained by structural and financial
variables, but this does not mean that the defi-

30The semi-elasticity of the current-account-to-GDP

trade openness (Lee and others, 2008). Therefore, the
measure of exchange rate deviation was interacted with
the ratio of the sum of exports and imports (adjusted for

cits are sustainable indefinitely. The rapid opening of the financial sector in emerging Europe
has not only accelerated access to capital, it has
also facilitated a credit boom, with the attendant risk that funds are being channeled to less
productive uses (Duenwald, Gueorguiev, and
Schaechter, 2005; and Rioja and Valev, 2004).
The chapter identifies and analyzes a number of
historical episodes of large, persistent surpluses
and deficits in order to draw lessons as to the
likely persistence of the current imbalances in
emerging Europe and emerging Asia.31
Large, persistent current account imbalances are defined as current account deficits or
surpluses that exceed 3 percent of GDP for at
least three years, provided that no large reversal
occurs during that period.32 Using this criterion,
there were 69 deficit episodes and 15 surplus
episodes during 1960–2007, with a higher
incidence during 1990–2005 (Figure 6.13; see
Appendix 6.2 for a list of all episodes). Interestingly, while the vast majority of current account
deficits in emerging Europe qualify as large and
persistent imbalances, only Malaysia and China
meet the criteria for a large and persistent surplus in the aftermath of the Asian crisis.33 Deficit episodes are further separated according to
whether or not they were resolved abruptly, with
abrupt endings characterized by an improvement of the current account of 4 percentage
points of GDP in the year following the end of

31There are few empirical studies of the persistence of
current account imbalance episodes in emerging economies. Edwards (2007) reports that large current account
surpluses exhibit little persistence. Aizenman and Sun
(2008) find that the length of current account deficits is
negatively related to the relative size of the deficit.
32See Appendix 6.2 for a detailed description of the
methodology, which is based on the adjustment algorithm
developed in Chapter 3 of the April 2007 World Economic
Outlook. The criteria are similar to the ones used to define
large reversals in the literature (see, for example, Freund
and Warnock, 2005).
33Large, persistent surpluses are also identified for
some of the NIEs. However, these are no longer considered emerging economies, and Singapore and Hong
Kong SAR differ because they are financial centers.

Sustainability of Current Account Imbalances

the episode.34 About one-third of the completed
deficit episodes ended abruptly.
The surplus episodes in China and Malaysia
are historically atypical. There have been few
large, persistent current account surpluses––they
account for only one-quarter of all persistent
imbalance episodes––and they occurred primarily in advanced economies. Earlier studies also
find abrupt adjustments of surplus episodes to
be rare (Edwards, 2007).35 The remainder of
this section therefore focuses on deficit episodes, which are by far the most common type
of large, persistent imbalances, especially in
emerging economies.36
The ongoing deficits in emerging Europe
stand out, because of both their length and
their magnitude (Figure 6.14). On average, current account deficits in emerging Europe have
lasted 9½ years, about 3 years longer than in
other emerging economies, and most of these
episodes are still ongoing. Interestingly, the
historical evidence shows that longer deficits are
not necessarily more shallow than shorter ones
(with the ongoing episodes in emerging European countries clearly fitting this pattern); they
also are no more likely to end abruptly.37 This
may reflect the fact that persistent deficits can
also be a sign of economic strength, reflecting
an abundance of investment opportunities or
a catch-up in productivity, which attract larger
inflows of foreign capital and lead ultimately to
a smooth resolution.38

and Surplus Episodes, 1960–2007 1

3 of the April 2007 World Economic Outlook
finds that surplus reversals in advanced and emerging
economies were associated with accelerations in GDP
growth and with real exchange rate appreciations.
36This pattern is consistent with the notion of capital
flowing downhill to countries with greater growth opportunities and with recent findings in the literature (see
World Economic Outlook, April 2007, and Edwards, 2007).
37The finding is robust to variations in the size of the
adjustment, using either 2 or 3 percent of GDP as a
threshold for identifying an abrupt adjustment.
38Another potential reason for a positive correlation
between the length and depth of episodes is that longer
periods of foreign borrowing tend to weaken net foreign
asset positions, which in turn weigh negatively on the net

224

The regional variations in the length of
imbalances comes out clearly in survival functions from duration analysis (Figure 6.15), which
report the estimated likelihood that a large
deficit will continue at a given duration, based
on a statistical analysis of observations following
the Kaplan-Meier estimation for survival curves.
The flatter curve for emerging Europe (top left
panel) indicates higher likelihoods of remaining in a large deficit and hence implies longer
durations than for other regions.39 A comparison of survival functions by different subgroups
and characteristics shows that deficits last longer
when the economy has a high initial net foreign
asset position, a more open capital account,
lower real per capita income, and higher GDP
growth. There appears to be little direct evidence that the type of exchange rate regime
influences the length of deficit episodes.
A more formal analysis of the duration of
imbalances suggests that growth opportunities,
the opening of the capital account, liberalization
of the financial system, and initially high net
foreign assets are important in explaining the
length of deficit episodes in emerging Europe
(Table 6.2; see Appendix 6.2 for more details).40
These are broadly the same factors that explain
the greater magnitude of these economies’
deficits (see Figures 6.9 and 6.10). Higher
growth opportunities, measured by a low initial
level of income per capita and high growth
observed during deficit episodes, offer more

income component of the current account. See also Lane
and Milesi-Feretti (2007).
39Berg, Ostry, and Zettelmeyer (2008) use a similar
empirical approach, but analyze the duration and survival
rates of growth upbreaks.
40The model does a good job at predicting that episodes will be longer in emerging Europe, on average two
to three years longer than for other emerging economies,
which is in line with current observations. Moreover, once
structural factors are taken into account, regional factors
are no longer significant (see Table 6.2, columns a and
e). The regression analysis confirms that the depth of the
current account deficit during the episode does not influence its length. Other factors that increase the length
of deficits include slow activity in advanced economies,
which frees capital to flow to emerging economies, and a
higher score on the political structure index.

Sustainability of Current Account Imbalances

productive investment opportunities and hence
tend to prolong the economy’s access to foreign
capital. The openness of the capital account
eases access to foreign capital, and financial
liberalization may improve the intermediation of
funds and hence make the deficit more sustainable.41 The empirical analysis also indicates that
a weak contribution of net exports to real GDP
growth tends to reduce the length of imbalance
episodes.42
The estimated model and observed fundamentals can be used to predict the length of deficit episodes in emerging Europe. The forecasts
suggest that most of these deficits have persisted
longer than expected (Figure 6.16).43 Because
most deficit episodes in emerging Europe are
still ongoing, the specification used for predicting the duration is based on parameters excluding these countries (see Table 6.2, column f);
this also ensures that their specific characteristics do not determine the results. The longest
spells are predicted for Estonia, Romania, and
Slovak Republic, with an average duration of
8.9 years. The deficits in the remaining two Baltic countries (Latvia and Lithuania) are forecast
to last 7.8 years, whereas significantly shorter
spells (4.2 years) are predicted for Bulgaria and
Hungary.44

Figure 6.15. Survival Functions of Deficit Episodes1
(Number of years on x-axis, percent on y-axis)
The main factors associated with prolonged foreign borrowing (that is, high survival
rates) are high initial net foreign asset positions, capital account openness, and

noteworthy factors do not empirically correlate
with the duration of large deficits: (1) the depth of the
current account deficits during the episode, although
lower payment obligations on foreign liabilities—measured by the average net income balance—improve
the ability to continue foreign borrowing; (2) the type
of capital inflows, in particular, the average size of FDI
inflows; and (3) the type of exchange rate regime (fixed
versus flexible), although the latter does help explain
how the imbalance episodes are resolved (see further
below). See Appendix 6.2 for details on results related to
domestic financial liberalization.
42Data limitations made it difficult to build a large
enough sample to test directly for the impact of deviations of the real exchange rate from its predicted value.
The results over a small sample suggest that an exchange
rate overvaluation tends to shorten deficit episodes, but
the coefficient was not statistically significant.
43Financial globalization, through its positive effect on
the availability of external financing, could also explain
the longer-than-expected borrowing episodes.

Economies in emerging Europe have been
able to attract foreign capital for sustained
periods in part because of favorable initial
conditions (for example, high net foreign assets
compared to other persistent deficit episodes)
and, in most countries, a rapid opening of
capital accounts. However, the average growth

226

contribution from net exports has been low
compared to sustained borrowing episodes in
other emerging economies. This is likely related
to strong exchange rates in several of these
countries and may also reflect low productivity
growth in the tradables sector, as a large share
of investment has been going into the nontrad-

Sustainability of Current Account Imbalances

ables sector (see Figure 6.11).45 There are some
warning signs in the Baltics and Bulgaria that
productivity growth has slowed (albeit from high
levels) and has been especially low in industry
since 2003 (Figure 6.17).
An extension of the empirical model examining how imbalance episodes have been resolved
in the past suggests that the Baltics and Bulgaria
are at a higher risk of an abrupt ending of their
deficits because of the very high openness of
their capital accounts and their fixed exchange
rate regimes.46 This vulnerability is heightened
by their strong exchange rates, especially for
the Baltics. In general, a more open capital
account has been associated with prolonged
deficit episodes that tend to end abruptly. Fixed
exchange rate regimes are also associated with
abrupt endings, but these episodes tend to be
shorter (see Appendix 6.2 for details).47 Among
the countries that had very open capital accounts
and experienced an abrupt ending of their
deficit is Malaysia (1995), whereas Thailand
(1982) experienced an abrupt ending under a
fixed exchange rate regime. On the other hand,
a higher value on the political structure index is
associated with longer-lasting and more smoothly
ending episodes.
45While

it is true that improvements in transportation,
financial services, and utility sectors enhance productivity, a significant amount of investment is taking place in
real estate and retail trade, with less clear productivityenhancing benefits (Rahman, 2008). See also Bems and
Schellekens (2007).
46Determinants and implications of current account
reversals were discussed in Chapter 3 of the April 2007
World Economic Outlook. This analysis finds that current
account reversals were preceded by a positive output gap
and had varied implications for output growth: contractionary reversals were associated with low openness to
trade and large initial deficits. In contrast, expansionary
reversals were associated with larger-than-average total
real depreciations and increases in savings rates (mainly
public), which allowed investment rates to be sustained.
47This finding complements recent empirical findings
on the persistence of current account imbalances under
different exchange rate regimes. Chinn and Wei (2008)
find no direct link between exchange rate regimes and
current account persistence. This result is qualified by
Ghosh, Terrones, and Zettelmeyer (2008), who report
that large reversals appear correlated with fixed exchange
rate regimes.

The growing divergence of current account
imbalances in emerging economies has led to
much discussion about the underlying causes
and the implications for growth and sustainability. Some suggest that large surpluses in emerging Asia could imply that income convergence
can be achieved without a need to borrow large
amounts of foreign capital and therefore without the associated vulnerabilities to external
stability. By contrast, emerging Europe’s ability
to borrow foreign capital for long periods
suggests that the standard growth model, with
capital flowing downhill, remains relevant. This
chapter explores the reasons for these diverging trends and assesses the sustainability of the
growing current account imbalances.
The empirical analysis suggests that structural
changes have been a main factor explaining the
different regional trends. In emerging Europe,
the large current account deficits are related to
a rapid liberalization of domestic financial markets and open capital accounts, which attracted
large capital inflows and prompted a rapid rise
of foreign bank ownership. The process of integration into the EU also enhanced foreign capital inflows by improving prospects for economic
and policy stability.
Economies in emerging Asia typically have
less open capital accounts, and liberalization of
domestic financial markets lags other regions.
Several countries in emerging Asia also have
different political structures and younger populations. These factors, and in particular the lack
of financial liberalization, explain a substantial part of the current account surpluses in
the region. As these countries move toward
more financial liberalization in the future, this
may help lower the surpluses by both raising
consumption and increasing foreign financing of investment. However, a large fraction
of the persistent current account surpluses in
these economies remains unexplained. One
candidate explanation is the undervaluation of
their exchange rates. However, it is difficult to
establish definitively whether the low exchange

Appendix 6.1. Variable Definitions and Data Source

rate levels reflect deliberate policy action—for
example, an attempt by some countries to build
high levels of international reserves after the
Asian crisis—or other unidentified factors that
moved current accounts decisively into surplus
after 1997–98.
As current account imbalances have
increased, the duration of imbalance episodes
has also lengthened, raising concerns about
their sustainability. Indeed, the number of large,
persistent current account deficits has risen rapidly since the 1990s, with many of these located
in emerging Europe. The main economic factors that explain prolonged deficits are favorable
initial net foreign asset positions, growth opportunities, and open capital accounts. By contrast,
prolonged surpluses are rare among emerging
economies.
Based on an analysis of historical patterns,
ongoing deficits in emerging Europe are
expected to last longer than in other regions,
although most are already at or beyond the
upper end of their expected duration. The basic
characteristics of emerging European economies
explain the prolonged length of their deficits,
but this is no safeguard against hard landings. Risk factors for abrupt endings to deficits
identified in the empirical analysis include
fixed exchange rate regimes and open capital
accounts, which are characteristic of many of
these economies. These countries’ choice of a
fixed exchange rate regime may be motivated by
many factors, in particular, the desire to enter
the euro area, but having made this choice,
these countries need to protect themselves
against external vulnerabilities by ensuring that
product and labor markets are flexible, that
strong financial regulatory and supervisory
frameworks are in place, and that macroeconomic policies are consistent with domestic and
external balance (see IMF, 2007).
The large surpluses in emerging Asia may be
safer from the point of view of external vulnerability. However, they may also entail lower-thandesirable consumption over the near term and
a less efficient allocation of capital, given that
saving and investment choices are made within

financial and corporate governance systems that
need to be more responsive to market forces.48
A gradual return to equilibrium exchange rate
levels would help address these concerns and
help forestall the type of negative effects on
productivity and growth that have been experienced in other countries that have grown
rapidly over extended periods with high rates of
investment. At the same time, as emphasized in
the IMF-led Multilateral Consultation on Global
Imbalances, a broader set of policies would help
smooth the adjustment process, including rebalancing the components of aggregate demand
and further financial liberalization to improve
both access to credit and the quality of financial
intermediation.

Appendix 6.1. Variable Definitions and
Data Source
The main authors of this appendix are Stephan Danninger
and Florence Jaumotte.

This appendix provides further details on the
construction of the variables used in Chapter
6 and the sources of the data. The analysis is
based on annual data from 1980 until most current. It covers countries with a 2006 level of real
GDP per capita above $2,000 and a population
of at least 2 million and excludes oil exporters
(according to the IMF World Economic Outlook
definition).

Balance of Payments Data
The main source for balance of payments data
is the IMF Balance of Payments Statistics, complemented by data from the IMF World Economic
Outlook (WEO) database and the External
Wealth of Nations Mark II database created by
Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2006) (for stock data
on foreign assets and liabilities).

Saving and Investment
Saving and investment data are taken from
the IMF WEO database. The breakdown of
saving and investment into their public and
private components is from the United Nations
National Accounts Statistics database and IMF
WEO database. Private saving is further disaggregated into corporate and household savings rates using the United Nations National
Accounts Statistics database and, where necessary, the CEIC Asia database. Post-2003 data for
China’s corporate and household saving rates
are based on staff estimates.

liberalization is an index combining information on interest rate controls, credit controls,
competition restrictions, state ownership,
quality of the banking supervision and regulation, policies to encourage the development of
bond and equity markets, and policies to permit
access by foreigners to the domestic stock market. The index is from Abiad, Detragiache, and
Tressel (forthcoming). Finally, the fraction of
foreign banks is taken from Claessens and others (2008). A bank is considered foreign-owned
if at least 50 percent of its shares are held by
foreign nationals in a given year (only direct
ownership is considered).

Standard Determinants

Exchange rate

The general government balance, the oil
balance (defined as the difference between
oil exports and imports), and real GDP per
capita growth are from the IMF WEO database, whereas output per capita in constant
­purchasing-power-parity (PPP) terms is taken
from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators. The latter is divided by the level in the
United States to generate relative income per
capita. Finally, population growth and the oldage dependency ratio are from the World Bank’s
World Development Indicators.

The deviation of the real effective exchange
rate from its predicted value is based on the
equilibrium real exchange rate approach developed as part of the IMF CGER assessment and
is calculated as the residual from a regression
of the CPI-based real effective exchange rate on
the productivity differential between tradables
and nontradables (the so-called Balassa-Samuelson effect), other factors affecting relative prices
(government consumption, trade restriction
index, price controls, and commodity terms of
trade), and net foreign assets (see Lee and others, 2008). Exchange rate deviation measures for
the Baltics not available through the IMF CGER
assessment are staff estimates based on a similar
methodology. The classification of exchange rate
regimes into fixed, intermediate, and flexible
is a “de facto” IMF exchange rate regime index
kindly provided by IMF staff member Harald
Anderson.

Additional Factors
Financial factors
Financial depth is measured by the sum of
credit to the private sector by deposit money
banks and other financial institutions and
stock market capitalization, divided by GDP.
The source is a 2007 update of the Financial Structure Database prepared by Beck,
­Demirgüç-Kunt, and Levine (2000). Data for
China are based on IMF staff calculations. The
capital account openness index is taken from
an update of Chinn and Ito (2006) and is based
on principal components extracted from disaggregated capital and current account restriction
measures in the IMF Annual Report on Exchange
Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions. Financial

230

Political factors
The political structure index is the “Polity2”
variable from the Polity IV Project (Marshall,
Jaggers, and Gurr, 2004). It covers a number of
dimensions, including the presence of institutions and procedures through which citizens can
express effective preferences about alternative
policies and leaders and the existence of institutionalized constraints on the exercise of power
by the executive.

Appendix 6.2. Econometric Approach

The EU integration measure captures how
far countries in emerging Europe (and Turkey)
are along the different stages of the formal
integration process, namely, EU membership
application, initiation of negotiation for EU
membership, EU accession, entry into ERM II,
and euro adoption. A score of 0.2 is given for
each stage; hence the maximum score is 1.

Vulnerability Indicators
Profitability of the nonfinancial sector is calculated as net income plus interest expense to
last year’s assets, adjusted for CPI inflation. Profitability of the financial sector is earnings before
extraordinary items and taxes in percent of total
assets. The data are from a July 2008 update of
Brooks and Ueda (2005) based on data from
Worldscope and Datastream.
Data on hourly labor productivity growth in
industry, services, and the aggregate economy
for the Baltics and central Europe are from the
Groningen Growth and Development Centre,
60-industry database, September 2006.

Event Study: Growth Accelerations and Current
Account Developments
To compare current account developments
in emerging Europe with experiences from past
growth accelerations, an event study analysis was
conducted based on the definition of growth
accelerations proposed by Hausmann, Pritchett,
and Rodrik (2005). An event is defined as the
onset of an acceleration in growth with the start
date identified by two criteria:
• growth is rapid: gt,t+n ≥ 3.5 percent per year,
with gt,t+8 = ln(yt+8) – ln(yt) being the real
per capita GDP growth rate at time t over an
eight-year horizon, and
• growth accelerates: Δ(gt) = (gt,t+8) – (gt–8,t) ≥
2.0 percent with Δ(gt) being the change in the
growth rate at time t.
Once an acceleration in growth is under way,
identification of the end of an acceleration is
based on two criteria: the average growth rate
declines below 2 percent, and growth in the

year following the end of the event dips below
3 percent.
These criteria were applied to the sample
of non-oil-exporting emerging and advanced
economies of this chapter between 1960 and
2007.49 A total of 63 episodes were identified, of
which 10 episodes from emerging Europe were
dropped due to their overlap with the comparator countries. Data limitations excluded the use
of another 38 episodes––29 accelerations had
start dates prior to 1970—so that the final group
of episodes comprised 15 growth accelerations
including the following countries: Cameroon,
China, Chile, Dominican Republic, Egypt,
Finland, Greece, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Lao
P.D.R., and Portugal. The average growth rate
prior to the onset of the identified accelerations
is –1.1 percent.

Appendix 6.2. Econometric Approach
The main authors of this Appendix are Stephan Danninger

This appendix describes in greater detail the
model underlying the econometric analysis of
the determinants of the current account balances and its estimation. It also presents some
additional results on the heterogeneity of coefficients across regions. Finally, it provides technical details of the duration analysis.

Determinants of the Current Account Balance
The model used in the empirical analysis
relates the current account balance (expressed
in percent of GDP) to a number of standard
determinants and a range of new factors. The

time-fixed effects, and X denotes a range of new
factors added to the standard model in several
stages (see main text). These are financial structure variables (financial depth, domestic financial liberalization, capital account openness) and
a measure of political structure.
Following the literature (see, for example,
Lee and others, 2008), a number of variables
are calculated as deviations from the average for
the rest of the world. These are the ratio of the
general government balance to GDP, the demographic variables, the growth of GDP per capita,
and the measure of political structure. Data are
averaged over four years to focus on determinants of medium-term movements in the current account. In order to minimize endogeneity
problems, net foreign assets, relative income
per capita, and financial depth are measured in
the year preceding the four-year period under
consideration; the growth rate of real GDP per
capita is measured over the four years preceding the current four-year period. The equations
do not include country-fixed effects and retain
the cross-sectional information since they will
be used to explain differences between countries. Time-fixed effects are included to capture
developments that affect similarly all countries

232

in a given year (for example, the aggregate
balance of savings and investment). The model
is estimated using ordinary least squares and
heteroscedasticity-robust standard errors.50
The sample of countries for which all variables used in the regressions were available consists of 58 advanced and emerging economies,
of which 21 are advanced economies and 37 are
emerging economies. Based on data availability,
the following countries are included:
• Advanced economies: Australia, Austria,
Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France,
Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan,
Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal,
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom,
and United States.
• Emerging economies: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa
Rica, Czech Republic, Egypt, El Salvador,
Estonia, Georgia, Hungary, India, Indonesia,
Israel, Jamaica, Jordan, Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Pakistan,
Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Romania,
South Africa, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Tunisia,
Turkey, and Uruguay.
The results of the estimations are reported in
the text.

Additional Results: Heterogeneity between
Regions
Reflecting emerging Europe’s special circumstances, the empirical analysis allowed
and tested for different coefficients for this
group of countries relative to the rest of the
sample. Equation (1) was extended to include
interaction terms between each of its variables
and a dummy variable for countries of emerging Europe. The hypothesis that the dummy
variable for emerging Europe and all the
interaction terms are zero (that is, that the
effects of the variables are similar for emerging Europe and other sample countries) could

are robust to including the capital accountto-GDP ratio as an explanatory variable, to control for

not be rejected except for the interaction terms
involving the general government balance and
domestic financial liberalization. 51
While the text shows that the differentiated
effect of the fiscal balance can be directly attributed to the EU integration process, this section
provides more evidence on the reason for the
differentiated impact of financial liberalization.
Financial liberalization has a stronger negative
impact on the current account in emerging
Europe than in the rest of the sample. This
likely reflects the much stronger presence of
foreign banks. Some supportive evidence for this
hypothesis was found using available data on the
fraction of foreign banks from Claessens and
others (2008) (the sample size falls to 77 observations). While domestic financial liberalization

(interacted with the emerging Europe dummy)
dominates the fraction of foreign banks when
they are entered jointly, the fraction of foreign
banks has a coefficient of a magnitude and
significance similar to that of domestic financial
liberalization (interacted with the emerging
Europe dummy) when it is entered on its own
(Table 6.3, columns c and d). This provides
some supportive evidence that the stronger
presence of foreign banks in emerging Europe
may have contributed to the stronger impact of
domestic financial liberalization on the current
account.

Duration Analysis and Current Account
Imbalances
This part provides greater detail on the identification of large, persistent current account

233

Chapter 6   Divergence of Current Account Balances across Emerging Economies

imbalances and describes the econometric methodology and additional results from the duration analysis discussed in the main text.
The method for identifying large, persistent
current account imbalances is based on the
approach developed in Chapter 3 of the April
2007 World Economic Outlook but with modified
parameters. For this chapter, the cutoff values
for large current account imbalance episodes
are a deficit or surplus of 3 percent of GDP or
larger for at least three years and during which
no current account reversal occurs.52 The latter
criterion ensures that the end of an episode
is dated at the onset of any large adjustments,
regardless of whether the imbalance crosses
the 3 percent of GDP threshold. Table 6.4 lists
all large, persistent current account imbalance
episodes that meet these criteria.

Duration Analysis
A duration analysis was performed to relate
different fundamental determinants to the
length of current account imbalances. Due to
the small number of persistent surpluses, the
analysis was limited to deficits.
The empirical approach models the hazard
rate of the duration of an imbalance episode,
which is equivalent to the conditional probability that an episode ends in the next period,
given a set of determinants x:
λ(t, x(t)) = limh-≥0 F(t ≤ T< t+h | x)/h = f(t|x)
/(1 – F(t|x(t))).
Formally, the hazard rate is defined as the
ratio of the density function f(t|x) of the duration T, and the survival function 1 – F(t, x),
where F(t,x) is the cumulative distribution function of T.53 The empirical implementation for
estimating the hazard rate is based on a proportional hazard rate model:
52A

description of the method used for identifying current account reversals and persistent imbalances can be
found in Appendix 3.1 of the April 2007 World Economic
Outlook.
53 For details on duration analysis concepts, see Kiefer
(1988) and Wooldridge (2002).

234

λ(t, x(t)) = exp(βx(t)) λ0(t),
with a Weibull specification for the baseline
hazard rate λ0= p tp–1. The parameters p and β are
estimated via maximum likelihood and determine
the shape of the baseline hazard rate function λ0
and the size of proportional shifts in the baseline
hazard rate related to determinants x(t). Due to
concerns about endogeneity of fundamental factors with respect to the length of an episode, the
model uses time-invariant controls x.54
The empirical analysis is based on 48 large,
persistent current account deficits and covers episodes from both advanced (35 percent)
and emerging economies (65 percent). The
main results are reported in the text. Other
explanatory variables and specifications were
explored––for instance capital account openness
has a larger effect at higher levels of per capita
income—but did not improve the model’s fit.
Additional results in Table 6.5 pertain to the
role of domestic financial liberalization on the
duration of episodes, which were omitted in
the main text due to reduced country coverage. The analysis shows that domestic financial
sector liberalization increases the length of an
episode (column a), but that this effect disappears once measures of political structure
and capital account openness are included
(column b). There is however evidence that
the speed of liberalization adds to the episode
length (column c), but the same is not true for
the speed of capital account liberalization and
change in political institutions (not shown). This
finding is consistent with the interpretation of
panel regression results presented in the main
text, which highlight the large effect of domestic
financial sector liberalization on capital inflows
in the past decade.

Deficit Episodes and Resolution of Imbalances
To explore the link between duration of
persistent deficits and their resolution, a compet54A

specification using time-varying controls was estimated and generated similar results to the ones reported
in the main body of the chapter.

ing risks model was estimated using the same
set of determinants as in Table 6.2. The empirical specification follows an approach proposed
by Lunn and McNeil (1995) and explores the
hazard rates for different exit types (abrupt and
non-abrupt endings). The model assumes that in
each period the total exit risk can be separated
into two additively separable risks for abrupt and
non-abrupt endings. The approach adds interaction terms between fundamental determinants

cations. The coefficients of the standard determinants (column a) are similar to the ones
presented in the main body of the chapter using
a Weibull specification (see Table 6.2). Note
however that the number of observations is twice
as large compared to the original duration model
specification since each observation is entered
twice to allow for different (competing) risks’
effects. The results in columns (b) and (c) report
hazard rate models for a common baseline hazard rate (top panel) and differences for hazards
with abrupt endings (lower panel). The interaction effects specification implies that the total
hazard rate for abrupt endings is determined by
the sum of the direct and the interaction effects.
The majority of explanatory variables do
not have significant additive risk factors (lower
panel) and hence do not indicate different
hazard rates by exit types. Significant interaction
effects are however found for net foreign assets,
capital account openness, and political structure.55 Combining the direct and interaction
effects, the results indicate that longer spells
due to greater capital account openness bear an
increasing risk of abrupt endings (column b in
Table 6.6). The results are different for net foreign assets and political structure due to the offsetting signs of the direct and interaction effects.
They imply that higher values on both indicators
increase the length of non-abrupt episodes, but
there are no effects for abrupt endings.
In column c of Table 6.6, a variable capturing the flexibility of the exchange rate regime
is introduced. The direct effect of this variable on the length of non-abrupt episodes is
negative, whereas the interaction effect has
the opposite sign and more than offsets the
direct effect. This implies that a more flexible
exchange rate regime reduces the length of
episodes that end non-abruptly—supporting
the view that flexibility reduces persistence—
and that fixed regimes are linked to shorter
episodes that end more abruptly.
55For net foreign assets a test of the joint significance
of the direct and interaction effects is rejected.

IMF Executive Board Discussion of the
Outlook, SEPTEMBER 2008
chapter title

The following remarks by the Acting Chair were made at the conclusion of the Executive
Board’s discussion of the World Economic Outlook on September 19, 2008.1

Global Prospects and Policies
Executive Directors noted that, after a fouryear expansion, the world economy is slowing
rapidly, buffeted by many forces, notably a deep
financial crisis, a housing downturn in a number
of advanced economies, and a surge in commodity prices until recent months. Many advanced
economies are close to recession, and emerging economies are also generally decelerating.
Looking ahead, Directors agreed that continuing
strained financial conditions will weigh heavily on
global growth prospects. With credit defaults still
on the rise, pressures on financial institutions’
capital positions will remain exceptionally high.
The necessary process of deleveraging will therefore be difficult and protracted, and credit availability will be very tight. Directors underscored
the unusual uncertainties in the global outlook
and the difficulty of predicting the severity of
the slowdown. Nevertheless, assuming that the
many public initiatives under way are successful
in lowering financial market strains and rebuilding confidence, it is the IMF staff view that the
still relatively sound nonfinancial corporate balance sheets in advanced economies and resilient
domestic demand in emerging economies should
support the beginning of a global economic
recovery later in 2009, as the effects of the commodity price shocks unwind and housing activity
in the United States stabilizes.
The IMF staff provided an informal briefing to the
Executive Board on October 3, 2008, on the revisions to
the World Economic Outlook made in light of the developments in global financial markets and commodity markets
since the Executive Board discussion of September 19,
and this summing up reflects the updates provided and
the ensuing discussion at that time.

Directors noted that the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook is exceptionally large,
with risks clearly to the downside. The principal risk relates to the potential for a further
deterioration in financial conditions and more
protracted balance-sheet adjustments. Directors
acknowledged that, as the events of recent weeks
demonstrate, the financial crisis has not yet run
its full course, and other major disturbances may
still lie ahead. Risks of an intensified negative
feedback loop between the financial system and
the real sectors of advanced economies have
risen, as have the risks of stronger spillovers to
emerging markets. A further marked weakening
of commodity prices could pose a downside risk
to already slowing growth in several commodityexporting emerging economies.
Directors underscored the complex challenges facing policymakers at this juncture in
light of the uncertain outlook and the financial
turmoil. First and foremost, policymakers in
the advanced economies will need to address
stresses in financial markets in a coherent and
consistent manner, while adjusting macroeconomic policies with a view to striking the right
balance between supporting growth and combating inflation. The financial authorities should
continue to give priority to stabilizing financial
conditions, including guarding against systemic
failures through liquidity provision and prompt
intervention when needed, while also being
mindful of the need to avoid moral hazard. This
likely will require broad and well-coordinated
policy actions. On monetary policy, given tight
credit conditions, growing unemployment fears,
subdued wage growth, and still-well-anchored
inflation expectations, the IMF staff sees scope

241

for easing in advanced economies with relatively
higher real rates of interest. A number of other
Directors, however, favored a cautious approach
to easing, pointing to the risks of second-round
effects from the recent increases in inflation
and the challenge of ensuring that expectations
remain well anchored. On fiscal policy, Directors
welcomed the timely support being provided to
a number of economies. However, they recalled
the importance of medium-term consolidation
and thus suggested that further fiscal initiatives
should be limited to dealing with financial problems as needed.
In the wake of recent commodity price
declines and the projected slowdown in global
activity, Directors expected headline inflation to moderate in emerging and developing
economies. This means that macroeconomic
policies could stay on hold in an increasing
number of these economies, or even ease if the
outlook threatened to deteriorate further. In
other economies, many Directors observed that
underlying inflation pressures remain an issue.
They observed that these economies face greater
risks of second-round effects than advanced
economies, owing to the higher share of food
and fuel in consumption baskets and low spare
capacity. Many Directors therefore considered
that policymakers in these countries should lean
toward tightening the overall stance of macroeconomic policies. Additionally, these Directors underscored that monetary policy should
take the lead role in short-term stabilization in
economies with inflation targeting and flexible
exchange rate management, while recognizing
that country circumstances differ and that open
capital markets can pose special challenges in
these cases. They recognized the challenges
facing countries with heavily managed exchange
rate regimes that are now in effect importing an accommodative monetary policy stance
from the United States, while still experiencing
strong growth and current account surpluses. A
number of Directors observed that more flexible
exchange rates would help in some cases by
providing scope for adjusting monetary conditions and fostering a rebalancing of demand in
242

their economies. Several other Directors stressed
that the choice of the exchange rate regime
depends on broader considerations, and that in
the countries with fixed exchange rates, fiscal
policy would have to take the lead in relieving
any excess demand pressures that threaten the
viability of the peg. Several Directors argued
that more monetary and fiscal tightening may
not be needed, as headline inflation is likely to
moderate in the near term and a slowing global
economy would alleviate overheating concerns.

Advanced Economies
Although the U.S. economy continued to
grow at a moderate pace in the first half of 2008,
Directors agreed that activity is likely to slow
appreciably in the second half. Given the exceptionally unsettled financial market conditions,
most Directors expected a prolonged period of
very low growth, followed by a gradual recovery that would begin later in 2009. The pickup
would be driven by a turnaround in private
consumption and residential investment as commodity and housing prices stabilize, although
financial conditions are expected to remain
tight. Directors expected underlying price pressures to be contained as economic slack rises in
the coming months.
Against this background, Directors acknowledged that the U.S. authorities’ accommodative
monetary policy thus far has provided support
to the economy in the face of financial stress
and the continuing housing correction. They
thought that further easing should not be ruled
out in view of the deteriorating outlook. By the
same token, once economic recovery gains traction and financial conditions stabilize, policies
should shift toward a less supportive stance. The
fiscal stimulus package has also provided a useful and timely boost to activity. However, given
long-term fiscal challenges, further policy initiatives should be focused on providing support for
the banking and housing sectors as needed to
maintain stability. Directors welcomed the recent
intervention in government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) as an important step to ensure

IMF Executive Board Discussion of the Outlook, SEPTEMBER 2008

the continued availability of housing financing,
while stressing the need for fundamental GSE
reform over the medium run. More broadly,
they welcomed the authorities’ recent additional
efforts to ensure an orderly resolution of the
ongoing crisis, while remaining mindful of the
need to contain moral hazard.
Directors observed that western European
economies have slowed considerably. Higher oil
and food prices have undercut real disposable
incomes, while tighter financial conditions have
raised the costs of household mortgages and
slowed investment. In some countries, particularly the United Kingdom and Spain, weak housing has weighed heavily on economic activity.
Although European banks entered the turmoil
from a position of strength, they have been
exposed in varying degrees to losses on their
holdings of U.S. mortgage‑related assets, tightening liquidity conditions, and deteriorating credit
quality. As in the United States, financial institutions have been shaken by recent events, with
some requiring public support. Given the need
for further deleveraging to rebuild confidence,
Directors thought that overall credit conditions
will likely remain tight for some time. Growth is
expected to remain weak for a prolonged period
of time before starting to recover gradually later
in 2009, as credit markets and commodity prices
stabilize and confidence is restored.
With the prospect of a further weakening of
economic activity and generally well-anchored
inflationary expectations, as well as high risk
premiums, many Directors considered that
inflation pressures would subside over the near
term, providing scope to ease monetary policies.
Underscoring the benefits of rules-based policies
and the medium-term need for consolidation,
Directors encouraged firm adherence to national
and EU fiscal policy frameworks, which would
generally weigh against fiscal stimulus packages,
unless downside risks materialize. Furthermore,
a decisive commitment to concerted action with
respect to addressing growing financial sector
strains would go a long way toward restoring
more orderly conditions in financial markets.

Directors observed that the near-term outlook
for Japan has deteriorated. Although financial
conditions have tightened to a lesser extent
than in other major economies owing to the
lower exposure of Japanese banks to securitized
products, Directors expected that high food and
fuel prices and weaker external growth would
weigh on consumer and business activity. Most
Directors considered that, with the economy
weakening and underlying price pressures well
contained, the monetary stance should remain
accommodative. For fiscal policy, the priority
remains medium-term consolidation owing to a
rapidly aging population and rising public debt—
although automatic stabilizers could be allowed
to operate in the event of a sharp downturn.

Emerging and Developing Economies
Growth of emerging Asian economies is
expected to moderate over the near term, but
to remain around trend in many cases. However, Directors emphasized the increasing risk
that growth could slow more markedly owing to
intensified financial market stress and a sharper‑than‑anticipated slowdown in trading partner
countries. On the other hand, in some countries inflation could remain at elevated levels,
despite the recent easing in commodity prices,
as spare capacity has largely been eroded. Thus,
countries’ policies need to be tailored to their
particular circumstances, which are diverse. Most
Directors were of the view that countries with
heavily managed exchange rate regimes would
benefit from shifting to more flexible exchange
rate management that would provide more
scope for monetary adjustment and foster global
rebalancing. At the same time, Directors underscored that global rebalancing would require a
mix of appropriate and complementary policies and could not be left solely to adjustments
in exchange rates. Fiscal restraint could help
reduce inflation concerns, while continued
efforts at fiscal consolidation remain an important priority for other countries in the region.
Directors observed that Latin American
economies face a challenging combination of
243

ANNEX   IMF Executive Board Discussion of the Outlook, SEPTEMBER 2008

slowing activity, volatile financial conditions, and
still-­elevated inflation pressures. While acknowledging growing downside risks to growth, largely
reflecting external factors, many Directors
stressed that the priority for policies in a number of countries remains to quell the surge of
inflation. While tightening has occurred, notably
in countries with inflation-targeting regimes,
more action will likely be needed in some
countries where real interest rates have become
significantly negative and policy credibility is
being eroded. Shifts in international oil and
food prices should be allowed to pass through to
the domestic market, using targeted programs to
protect the poor.
Directors noted that, after a prolonged economic expansion, activity in emerging Europe
has started to moderate, with the Baltic countries
undergoing sharp corrections as earlier booms
have started to unwind. Some countries with
large current account deficits could be vulnerable
to a reversal of capital inflows. Containing inflation pressures also remains a concern, particularly in southeastern European economies. This
underlines the importance of macroeconomic
policies that steer economies toward a “soft landing,” as well as of prudential and regulatory policies to contain balance sheet vulnerabilities.
Real GDP growth remains strong in the Commonwealth of Independent States, underpinned
by terms-of-trade gains and expansionary macroeconomic policies, although external conditions are becoming more noticeably difficult for
several countries. Directors agreed that stronger
policy action is needed in many countries in the
region to rein in rising inflation pressures and
address external pressures. A comprehensive
policy response would require a combination
of monetary tightening and greater exchange
rate flexibility, combined with a prudent fiscal stance. Over the longer term, Directors
emphasized that the region should continue to
reduce its vulnerability to commodity price shifts
through diversification of the economy away
from primary commodities.
Directors were encouraged that growth in subSaharan Africa is expected to show resilience

244

to the global slowdown, but expressed concern
about the impact of the recent surge in food
and fuel prices on poverty and about risks of a
lower pace of financing and investment inflows.
The oil-exporting countries in this region face
the challenge of managing the windfall gains
from high commodity prices. A number of oilimporting countries, where the negative termsof-trade shock has weakened fiscal and external
positions, will need to tighten their macroeconomic policies, while stepped-up donor support
will be essential to help low-income countries
cope with high commodity prices.
Directors observed that activity in the Middle
East continues to grow at a robust pace, supported by higher oil prices, an improving business environment, and a buildup in government
spending in oil-exporting countries. Inflation
pressures either remain high or have risen
considerably. Directors recommended focusing
public spending on infrastructure to address
supply bottlenecks, while some cautioned that
rising inflation pressures may require exercising
greater restraint over current spending to counterbalance strong private demand growth. A few
Directors suggested that some countries should
consider moving away from U.S. currency pegs.
At the same time, Directors emphasized the
need to continue strengthening macroeconomic
policy frameworks and pursuing structural
reforms that are key to the region’s mediumterm prospects. Financial sector reforms would
be important to develop financial systems that
can support high and sustained growth and
more independent monetary policy.

Other Issues
Regarding the strains in financial markets,
Directors emphasized that the immediate tasks
are to safeguard financial stability, restore
healthy financial balance sheets by encouraging the rebuilding of capital bases, and guard
against systemic failures through liquidity
provision and intervention as needed. They
emphasized that this would require broad and
well-coordinated policy action. Over a longer

IMF Executive Board Discussion of the Outlook, SEPTEMBER 2008

horizon, determined efforts will be needed to
build firmer underpinnings for financial intermediation, learning lessons from the weaknesses
revealed by the present period of turbulence.
Central objectives include ensuring more effective and resilient risk management by individual
institutions, developing new securitization
techniques to improve incentives, and strengthening accounting and credit ratings systems to
raise transparency. Another important task will
be to strengthen approaches to crisis management and resolution, including clarifying roles
of different official agencies, bolstering deposit
insurance schemes, and ensuring adequate
intervention instruments, while taking care to
avoid exacerbating moral hazard. In many of
these areas, but particularly for the purpose of
preventing, managing, and resolving financial
stress, coordination across national boundaries
will be crucial, given the ever-larger international integration of financial institutions and
markets.
Directors generally saw merit in giving consideration to introducing a macroeconomic
element in the financial prudential framework to
weigh against the inherent procyclicality of credit
creation. Many Directors saw merit in the possibility of extending monetary policy frameworks
to provide for “leaning against the wind” of asset
price movements. However, a number of other
Directors pointed to the complexities that this
involves and questioned the potential benefits.
Directors emphasized that joint multilateral efforts will be crucial to relieve strains in
commodity and financial markets in a lasting
way. Many Directors agreed with the IMF staff’s
analysis in Chapter 3, which finds little concrete
evidence that rising investor interest in commodities as an alternative asset or speculation
has had a systematic or lasting impact on prices,
although swings in market sentiment may have
contributed to short-term price dynamics. Some
Directors, however, had further questions and
requested additional analysis, based on data
refinements. Directors considered that the focus
should be on policies to encourage stronger supply and demand responses to improve market

balances, while avoiding measures that could
exacerbate market tightness in the short term.
Directors stressed that the multilateral strategy
endorsed by the IMFC in 2005 and elaborated
by the Multilateral Consultation on Global
Imbalances in 2006 and 2007 remains relevant
but should be applied flexibly. In this context,
they acknowledged that the issues related to
global imbalances are shifting. U.S. fiscal consolidation remains a key medium-term objective,
but countercyclical fiscal stimulus and public
support for the housing and financial sectors
have been warranted to alleviate the current
slowdown and stabilize markets. For their part,
the euro area and Japan should press ahead
with product and labor market reforms to raise
potential growth in their economies. China
needs to build on the progress in boosting
domestic demand and continue to contribute
to addressing global imbalances. The recent
increase in surpluses of Middle Eastern oil
exporters is an inevitable counterpart of higher
oil prices, given absorptive capacity constraints,
and it appears that the recycling of surpluses
to importing economies has generally worked
well so far. Nevertheless, it will be important to
ensure a transparent and open environment
for capital flows, including through finalizing
a set of good practices for sovereign wealth
funds. IMF staff analysis shows that there has
been further—albeit uneven—progress toward
realignment of major world currencies. The real
effective exchange rate of the U.S. dollar is now
judged to have moved broadly into line with
medium-run fundamentals, and this should help
lower the U.S. current account deficit. However,
the dollar realignment is mostly attributable to
the depreciation against the euro rather than
against the currencies of major current account
surplus countries. Also, the real effective
exchange rate of the euro remains on the strong
side of fundamentals. Directors noted the IMF
staff’s assessment that China’s exchange rate is
still substantially undervalued. At this juncture,
it is important to resist protectionist pressures
and to make progress toward multilateral trade
liberalization by unblocking the Doha Round.

T

he Statistical Appendix presents historical data, as well as projections. It comprises five sections: Assumptions, What’s
New, Data and Conventions, Classification of Countries, and Statistical Tables.
The assumptions underlying the estimates and
projections for 2008–09 and the medium-term
scenario for 2010–13 are summarized in the
first section. The second section presents a brief
description of changes to the database and statistical tables. The third section provides a general
description of the data and of the conventions
used for calculating country group composites.
The classification of countries in the various
groups presented in the World Economic Outlook is
summarized in the fourth section.
The last, and main, section comprises the
statistical tables. Data in these tables have been
compiled on the basis of information available through early October 2008. The figures
for 2008 and beyond are shown with the same
degree of precision as the historical figures
solely for convenience; because they are projections, the same degree of accuracy is not to be
inferred.

Assumptions
Real effective exchange rates for the advanced
economies are assumed to remain constant at
their average levels during the period August
18 to September 15, 2008. For 2008 and 2009,
these assumptions imply average U.S. dollar/SDR conversion rates of 1.596 and 1.567,
U.S. dollar/euro conversion rates of 1.52 and
1.50, and yen/U.S. dollar conversion rates of
106.5 and 108.3, respectively.
It is assumed that the price of oil will average
$107.25 a barrel in 2008 and $100.50 a barrel in
2009.
Established policies of national authorities are
assumed to be maintained. The more specific

policy assumptions underlying the projections
for selected advanced economies are described
in Box A1.
With regard to interest rates, it is assumed that
the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)
on six-month U.S. dollar deposits will average
3.2 percent in 2008 and 3.1 percent in 2009, that
three-month euro deposits will average 4.8 percent in 2008 and 4.2 percent in 2009, and that
six-month Japanese yen deposits will average
1.0 percent in 2008 and 1.2 percent in 2009.
With respect to introduction of the euro, on
December 31, 1998, the Council of the European Union decided that, effective January 1,
1999, the irrevocably fixed conversion rates
between the euro and currencies of the member
states adopting the euro are as follows.

Statistical Appendix

Box A1. Economic Policy Assumptions Underlying the Projections for Selected
Economies
The short-term fiscal policy assumptions used in
the World Economic Outlook are based on officially
announced budgets, adjusted for differences
between the national authorities and the IMF
staff regarding macroeconomic assumptions and
projected fiscal outturns. The medium-term fiscal projections incorporate policy measures that
are judged likely to be implemented. When the
IMF staff has insufficient information to assess
the authorities’ budget intentions and prospects for policy implementation, an unchanged
structural primary balance is assumed, unless
otherwise indicated. Specific assumptions used
in some of the advanced economies follow (see
also Tables B5–B7 in the Statistical Appendix for
data on fiscal and structural balances).
United States. The fiscal projections are based
on the administration’s fiscal year 2009 budget
and mid-session review. The fiscal projections
do not reflect the impact of the most recent
government interventions in financial markets,
instead accounting only for the $25 billion in
support for the government-sponsored enterprises estimated by the Congressional Budget
Office (CBO) in July 2008. Adjustments are
made to account for differences in macroeconomic projections as well as IMF staff assumptions about (1) additional defense spending
The output gap is actual minus potential output,
as a percent of potential output. Structural balances
are expressed as a percent of potential output. The
structural budget balance is the budgetary position
that would be observed if the level of actual output
coincided with potential output. Changes in the
structural budget balance consequently include effects
of temporary fiscal measures, the impact of fluctuations in interest rates and debt-service costs, and other
noncyclical fluctuations in the budget balance. The
computations of structural budget balances are based
on IMF staff estimates of potential GDP and revenue
and expenditure elasticities (see the October 1993
World Economic Outlook, Annex I). Net debt is defined
as gross debt minus financial assets of the general
government, which include assets held by the social
security insurance system. Estimates of the output gap
and of the structural balance are subject to significant
margins of uncertainty.

248

based on analysis by the CBO, (2) slower
compression in the growth rate of discretionary spending, and (3) continued alternative
minimum tax relief beyond fiscal year 2009.
Projections also assume that proposed Medicare
savings are achieved only partially and that personal retirement accounts are not introduced.
Japan. The medium-term fiscal projections
assume that expenditure and revenue of the
general government (excluding social security)
are adjusted in line with the current government target to achieve primary fiscal balance
(excluding social security) by fiscal year 2011.
Germany. Projections reflect the measures
announced in the Stability Program Update
2007. Projections for 2008 include a loss in
revenue owing to corporate tax reform and a
cut in social security contribution rates (unemployment insurance). Over the medium term,
health expenditures accelerate because the
population is aging and health care reform
measures have not been taken.
France. For 2008, the fiscal projections are
based on the budget law and assume higher
social security spending growth, largely owing
to higher-than-targeted increases in health care
outlays. Medium-term projections reflect the
authorities’ official tax revenue forecast but
assume different spending (less deceleration)
and nontax revenue profiles, consistent with an
unchanged policy assumption.
Italy. For 2009, the projection is based on
the IMF staff’s evaluation of the fiscal package
that anticipated the 2009 budget, as passed in
August 2008. For 2010–13, a constant primary
structural balance is assumed.
United Kingdom. The medium-term revenue
projections are consistent with the IMF staff’s
macroeconomic assumptions. The expenditure
projections assume that after the planned consolidation, set out in the 2008 budget, expenditures will continue in terms of the percent of
GDP through 2012–13.
Canada. Projections use the baseline forecasts in the 2008 federal budget and the 2007

Statistical Appendix

Economic Statement. The IMF staff makes
some adjustments to this forecast for differences in macroeconomic projections. The IMF
staff forecast also incorporates the most recent
data releases from Statistics Canada, including
provincial and territorial budgetary outturns
through the first quarter of 2008.
Australia. The fiscal projections through
fiscal year 2011/12 are based on the budget
published in May 2008. For the remainder of
the projection period, the IMF staff assumes
unchanged policies.
Austria. Projections for 2008 are based on current policies. For the medium term, fiscal policy
assumptions take into account announced
future policy measures, including tax cuts, that
are judged likely to be implemented.
Belgium. Projections for 2008 are IMF staff
estimates based on the 2008 budget voted by the
Parliament in May 2008 and adjusted for macroeconomic assumptions. Projections for 2009 are
IMF staff estimates, adjusted for macroeconomic
assumptions and assuming unchanged policies.
Brazil. The fiscal projections for 2008 are
based on the 2008 budget guidelines law and
recent pronouncements by the authorities
regarding their policy intentions. For the outer
years, the IMF staff assumes unchanged policies,
with a further increase in public investment in
line with the authorities’ intentions.
China. Projections for 2008 are based on
IMF staff estimates and data for the first three
months, with some adjustment for the IMF
staff’s definition of overall budget balance.
For 2009–13, IMF staff projections assume
that spending, especially in social sectors, will
increase, with the deficit roughly constant at its
projected 2008 level (about 1 percent of GDP).
Denmark. Projections for 2008 and 2009 are
aligned with the latest official budget estimates
and the underlying projections, adjusted where
appropriate for the IMF staff’s macroeconomic
assumptions. For 2009–13, the projections incorporate key features of the prior medium-term
fiscal plan as embodied in the authorities’ November 2007 Convergence Program submitted to the

European Union. The projections imply convergence of the budget toward a close-to-balanced
position from an initial surplus position. This is
consistent with the authorities’ projection of a
closure of the output gap over the medium term,
as well as being in line with their objectives for
long-term fiscal sustainability and debt reduction.
Greece. Projections are based on the 2008
budget, the latest Stability Program, and other
forecasts and data provided by the authorities.
Hong Kong SAR. Fiscal projections for 2007–10
are consistent with the authorities’ mediumterm strategy as outlined in the fiscal year
2007/08 budget, with projections for 2011–13
based on the assumptions underlying the IMF
staff’s medium-term macroeconomic scenario.
India. Estimates for 2007 are based on data on
budgetary execution. Projections for 2008 and
beyond are based on available information on
the authorities’ fiscal plans, with some adjustments for the IMF staff’s assumptions.
Korea. The fiscal projections reflect the 2008
budget and the five-year medium-term budget
for 2009–13, with some adjustment for measures
announced since the passage of the budget as
well as the IMF staff’s assumptions and macroeconomic projections.
Mexico. Fiscal projections for 2008 build
on the authorities’ budget and also take into
consideration higher-than-budgeted oil prices.
Projections for 2009 and beyond are based on
IMF staff calculations in line with the Federal
Government Fiscal Responsibility Law, requiring
a zero overall balance according to the traditional budget definition.
Netherlands. The fiscal projections build on
the 2007 budget, the latest Stability Program,
and other forecasts provided by the authorities.
New Zealand. The fiscal projections through
fiscal year 2011/12 are based on the 2008 budget, released in May 2008. For the remainder
of the projection period, the IMF staff assumes
unchanged policies. The New Zealand fiscal
account switched to generally accepted accounting principles beginning in fiscal year 2006/07,
with no comparable historical data.

249

Statistical Appendix

Box A1 (concluded)
Portugal. Fiscal projections for 2008–10 are
based on unchanged policies specified in the
2008 Budgetary Policy Steering Report. They take
into account the anticipated savings from the
reforms that have already been introduced (for
example, of the social security system and public
sector administration reform). Beyond 2011, no
further consolidation is assumed, and the structural primary balance is kept unchanged.
Russia. Fiscal projections for Russia are based
on the 2008 budget, the authorities’ proposed
medium-term budget for 2009–11 and, for later
years, the ceiling for the non-oil deficit of the
federal government as imposed by the budget
code. Differences in expenditure projections
between those of the IMF staff and of the
authorities for 2009 and beyond reflect mainly
different assumptions for real GDP, inflation,
and revenues.
Singapore. For fiscal year 2007/08, expenditure projections are based on budget numbers,
whereas revenue projections reflect the IMF
staff’s estimates of the impact of new policy
measures, including an increase in the goods
and services tax. Medium-term revenue projections assume that capital gains on fiscal reserves
will be included in investment income.
Spain. Fiscal projections through 2010 are
based on the 2008 budget and policies outlined
in the authorities’ updated Stability Program
2007–10, adjusted for the IMF staff’s macroeconomic assumptions, information from recent

The data are maintained jointly by the IMF’s
Research Department and area departments,

statistical releases, and official announcements.
In subsequent years, fiscal projections assume
unchanged policies.
Sweden. Fiscal projections are based on information provided in the 2009 Fiscal Policy Bill
(April 2008), with adjustments reflecting incoming fiscal data and the IMF staff’s views on the
macroeconomic environment.
Switzerland. Projections for 2008–13 are based
on IMF staff calculations, which incorporate
measures to restore balance in the federal
accounts and strengthen social security finances.
Monetary policy assumptions are based on the
established policy framework in each country.
In most cases, this implies a nonaccommodative
stance over the business cycle: official interest
rates will increase when economic indicators
suggest that inflation will rise above its acceptable rate or range, and they will decrease when
indicators suggest that prospective inflation
will not exceed the acceptable rate or range,
prospective output growth is below its potential
rate, and the margin of slack in the economy is
significant. On this basis, the London interbank
offered rate on six-month U.S. dollar deposits
is assumed to average 3.2 percent in 2008 and
3.1 percent in 2009 (see Table 1.1). The rate
on three-month euro deposits is assumed to
average 4.8 percent in 2008 and 4.2 percent
in 2009. The interest rate on six-month Japanese
yen deposits is assumed to average 1.0 percent
in 2008 and 1.2 percent in 2009.

with the latter regularly updating country projections based on consistent global assumptions.
Although national statistical agencies are
the ultimate providers of historical data and
definitions, international organizations are also
involved in statistical issues, with the objective
of harmonizing methodologies for the national
compilation of statistics, including the analytical
frameworks, concepts, definitions, classifications,
and valuation procedures used in the production of economic statistics. The World Economic

Statistical Appendix

Outlook database reflects information from
both national source agencies and international
organizations.
The comprehensive revision of the standardized System of National Accounts 1993 (SNA), the
IMF’s Balance of Payments Manual, Fifth Edition
(BPM5), the Monetary and Financial Statistics
Manual (MFSM), and the Government Finance
Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) represented
significant improvements in the standards of
economic statistics and analysis. The IMF was
actively involved in all these projects, particularly
the Balance of Payments, Monetary and Financial
Statistics, and Government Finance Statistics manuals, which reflects the IMF’s special interest in
countries’ external positions, financial sector
stability, and public sector fiscal positions. The
process of adapting country data to the new
definitions began in earnest when the manuals
were released. However, full concordance with
the manuals is ultimately dependent on the provision by national statistical compilers of revised
country data, and hence the World Economic
Outlook estimates are still only partially adapted
to these manuals.
In line with recent improvements in standards
for reporting economic statistics, several countries have phased out their traditional fixed-baseyear method of calculating real macroeconomic
variables levels and growth by switching to a
chain-weighted method of computing aggregate
growth. Recent dramatic changes in the structure of these economies have caused these countries to revise the way in which they measure
real GDP levels and growth. Switching to the
chain-weighted method of computing aggregate
growth, which uses current price information,
allows countries to measure GDP growth more

are based on unrevised national accounts and
subject to revision in the future.
The members of the European Union have
adopted a harmonized system for the compilation of national accounts, referred to as
ESA 1995. All national accounts data from
1995 onward are presented on the basis of the
new system. Revision by national authorities
of data prior to 1995 to conform to the new
system has progressed but, in some cases, has
not been completed. In such cases, historical
World Economic Outlook data have been carefully
adjusted to avoid breaks in the series. Users of
EU national accounts data prior to 1995 should
nevertheless exercise caution until such time as
the revision of historical data by national statistical agencies has been fully completed. See Box
1.2 of the May 2000 World Economic Outlook.
Composite data for country groups in the
World Economic Outlook are either sums or
weighted averages of data for individual countries. Unless otherwise indicated, multiyear aver-

ages of growth rates are expressed as compound
annual rates of change. Arithmetically weighted
averages are used for all data except inflation and
money growth for the emerging and developing
economies group, for which geometric averages
are used. The following conventions apply.
• Country group composites for exchange
rates, interest rates, and the growth rates of
monetary aggregates are weighted by GDP
converted to U.S. dollars at market exchange
rates (averaged over the preceding three
years) as a share of group GDP.
• Composites for other data relating to the
domestic economy, whether growth rates or
ratios, are weighted by GDP valued at PPPs as
a share of total world or group GDP.
• Composites for data relating to the domestic economy for the euro area (15 member
countries throughout the entire period unless
otherwise noted) are aggregates of national
source data using GDP weights. Annual data
are not adjusted for calendar day effects. For
data prior to 1999, data aggregations apply
1995 European currency unit exchange rates.
• Composite unemployment rates and employment growth are weighted by labor force as a
share of group labor force.
• Composites relating to the external economy
are sums of individual country data after
conversion to U.S. dollars at the average market exchange rates in the years indicated for
balance of payments data and at end-of-year
market exchange rates for debt denominated
in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Composites of changes in foreign trade volumes
Averages for real GDP and its components, employment, per capita GDP, inflation, factor productivity,
trade, and commodity prices are calculated based on the
compound annual rate of change, except for the unemployment rate, which is based on the simple arithmetic
average.
See Box A2 of the April 2004 World Economic Outlook
for a summary of the revised PPP-based weights and
Annex IV of the May 1993 World Economic Outlook. See
also Anne-Marie Gulde and Marianne Schulze-Ghattas,
“Purchasing Power Parity Based Weights for the World
Economic Outlook,” in Staff Studies for the World Economic
Outlook (International Monetary Fund, December 1993),
pp. 106–23.

and prices, however, are arithmetic averages
of percent changes for individual countries
weighted by the U.S. dollar value of exports
or imports as a share of total world or group
exports or imports (in the preceding year).
For central and eastern European countries,
external transactions in nonconvertible currencies (through 1990) are converted to U.S. dollars
at the implicit U.S. dollar/ruble conversion rates
obtained from each country’s national currency
exchange rate for the U.S. dollar and for the ruble.
All data refer to calendar years, except for the
following countries, which refer to fiscal years:
Australia (July/June), Egypt (July/June), Haiti
(October/September), Islamic Republic of Iran
(April/March), Mauritius (July/June), Myanmar
(April/March), Nepal (July/June), New Zealand
(July/June), Pakistan (July/June), Samoa (July/
June), and Tonga (July/June).

Classification of Countries
Summary of the Country Classification
The country classification in the World Economic
Outlook divides the world into two major groups:
advanced economies and emerging and developing economies. Rather than being based on
strict criteria, economic or otherwise, this classification has evolved over time with the objective
of facilitating analysis by providing a reasonably
meaningful organization of data. Table A provides
an overview of these standard groups in the World
Economic Outlook, showing the number of countries in each group and the average 2007 shares of
groups in aggregate PPP-valued GDP, total exports
of goods and services, and population.
A few countries are currently not included in
these groups, either because they are not IMF
members and their economies are not monitored by the IMF or because databases have

As

used here, the term “country” does not in all cases
refer to a territorial entity that is a state as understood
by international law and practice. It also covers some territorial entities that are not states, but for which statistical
data are maintained on a separate and independent basis.

General Features and Composition of
Groups in the World Economic Outlook
Classification

In 1991 and subsequent years, data for
Germany refer to west Germany and the eastern
Länder (that is, the former German Democratic
Republic). Before 1991, economic data were
not available on a unified basis or in a consistent manner. Hence, in tables featuring data
expressed as annual percent change, these apply
to west Germany in years up to and including 1991, but to unified Germany from 1992
onward. In general, data on national accounts
and domestic economic and financial activity
through 1990 cover west Germany only, whereas
data for the central government and balance of
payments apply to west Germany through June
1990 and to unified Germany thereafter.
Table C lists the member countries of the
European Union, not all of which are classified as
advanced economies in the World Economic Outlook.

Advanced Economies

Emerging and Developing Economies

The 31 advanced economies are listed in
Table B. The seven largest in terms of GDP—
the United States, Japan, Germany, France,
Italy, the United Kingdom, and Canada—
­constitute the subgroup of major advanced
­economies, often referred to as the Group of
Seven (G7). The 15 members of the euro area
and the four newly industrialized Asian economies
are also distinguished as subgroups. Composite data shown in the tables for the euro area
cover the current members for all years, even
though the membership has increased over
time.

The group of emerging and developing
economies (141 countries) includes all countries
that are not classified as advanced economies.
The regional breakdowns of emerging and
developing economies—Africa, central and eastern
Europe, Commonwealth of Independent States, developing Asia, Middle East, and Western Hemisphere—
largely conform to the regional breakdowns in
the IMF’s International Financial Statistics. In both
classifications, Egypt and Libya are included in
the Middle East region rather than in Africa. In
addition, the World Economic Outlook sometimes
refers to the regional group of Middle East and

Emerging and developing economies are also
classified according to analytical criteria. The
analytical criteria reflect countries’ composition of export earnings and other income from
abroad; exchange rate arrangements; a distinction between net creditor and net debtor countries; and, for the net debtor countries, financial
criteria based on external financing sources and
experience with external debt servicing. The
detailed composition of emerging and developing economies in the regional and analytical
groups is shown in Tables E and F.
The analytical criterion, by source of export
earnings, distinguishes between categories fuel
(Standard International Trade Classification—
SITC 3) and nonfuel and then focuses on nonfuel
primary products (SITCs 0, 1, 2, 4, and 68).
The financial criteria focus on net creditor
countries, net debtor countries, and heavily indebted
poor countries (HIPCs). Net debtor countries
are further differentiated on the basis of two
additional financial criteria: by official external
financing and by experience with debt servicing. The

1For

many countries, figures for recent years are IMF staff estimates. Data for some countries are for fiscal years.
percent changes in 2002 are calculated over a period of 18 months, reflecting a change in the fiscal year cycle (from July–June to January–December).
recent trends, it is not possible to forecast GDP with any precision, and consequently no projections for 2008 and beyond are shown.
4Data for some countries refer to real net material product (NMP) or are estimates based on NMP. For many countries, figures for recent years are IMF staff estimates. The
figures should be interpreted only as indicative of broad orders of magnitude because reliable, comparable data are not generally available. In particular, the growth of output
of new private enterprises of the informal economy is not fully reflected in the recent figures.

1In accordance with standard practice in the World Economic Outlook, movements in consumer prices are indicated as annual averages rather than as December/December
changes during the year, as is the practice in some countries. For many countries, figures for recent years are IMF staff estimates. Data for some countries are for fiscal years.
2The percent changes in 2002 are calculated over a period of 18 months, reflecting a change in the fiscal year cycle (from July–June to January–December).
32007 represents an estimate. No projections for 2008 and beyond are shown becuase Zimbabwe is in hyperinflation, and inflation can no longer be forecasted in a
meaningful way. Unless policies change, inflation can increase without limit.
4For many countries, inflation for the earlier years is measured on the basis of a retail price index. Consumer price indices with broader and more up-to-date coverage are
typically used for more recent years.
5Mongolia, which is not a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States, is included in this group for reasons of geography and similarities in economic structure.

Note: The methodology and specific assumptions for each country are discussed in Box A1 in this Statistical Appendix.
1Debt data refer to end of year. Debt data are not always comparable across countries.
2Percent of potential GDP.
3Beginning in 1995, the debt and debt-service obligations of the Treuhandanstalt (and of various other agencies) were taken over by general government. This debt is
equivalent to 8 percent of GDP, and the associated debt service to ½ to 1 percent of GDP.
4Excludes one-off receipts from the sale of mobile telephone licenses (the equivalent of 2.5 percent of GDP in 2000 for Germany, 0.1 percent of GDP in 2001 and 2002 for
France, and 1.2 percent of GDP in 2000 for Italy). Also excludes one-off receipts from sizable asset transactions, in particular 0.5 percent of GDP for France in 2005.

Note: The estimates in this table are based on individual countries’ national accounts and balance of payments statistics. Country group composites are calculated as
the sum of the U.S dollar values for the relevant individual countries. This differs from the calculations in the April 2005 and earlier World Economic Outlooks, where the
composites were weighted by GDP valued at purchasing power parities as a share of total world GDP. For many countries, the estimates of national savings are built up from
national accounts data on gross domestic investment and from balance-of-payments-based data on net foreign investment. The latter, which is equivalent to the current
account balance, comprises three components: current transfers, net factor income, and the resource balance. The mixing of data source, which is dictated by availability,
implies that the estimates for national savings that are derived incorporate the statistical discrepancies. Furthermore, errors, omissions, and asymmetries in balance of
payments statistics affect the estimates for net lending; at the global level, net lending, which in theory would be zero, equals the world current account discrepancy. Despite
these statistical shortcomings, flow of funds estimates, such as those presented in these tables, provide a useful framework for analyzing development in savings and
investment, both over time and across regions and countries.
1Calculated from the data of individual euro area countries.
2Mongolia, which is not a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States, is included in this group for reasons of geography and similarities in economic structure.
