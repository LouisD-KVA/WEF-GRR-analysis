First, such cooperation would help the South to decouple from the global cyclical trends of growth, thereby

The central message of TIR 2012 is that developing
countries, particularly emerging countries, can be important partners for promoting technological capabilities

collaboration for technology and innovation can be promoted in a systematic way to promote inclusive sustainable development should be a priority.

exchanges could lead to building technological capabilities, and under what circumstances. From an analysis of

Growing imports of capital goods by developing countries implies the expanding capacity in the South to produce goods, at least in some countries. It also shows
that imports of these goods by other developing countries are on the rise as part of their increasing efforts
to promote productive capacity. As noted earlier, such
imports are important for building productive capacity,
since they can result in the transfer of technology to the

which is leading to a surge in imports of technological
products from other countries in the South into these
economies. Many of these imports, as data trends show,
serve to meet growing demand driven by the expanding economic activities and consumption patterns in
these countries. Moreover, some emerging countries are
able to manufacture several high-technology products
at competitive prices, resulting in a shift in developingcountry imports from developed countries to developing
countries.
However, these trends are uneven across regions, and
are largely explained by the existence of production

progressed in technological sophistication as illustrated
by their ability to produce high- and medium-technologyintensive products using advanced processes. This further facilitates their ability to absorb newer products that

such as Southern Africa. Similar trends can be observed
with respect to medium-technology-intensive imports.
Generally, a country can import capital goods so long as
it can pay for them. However, what remains important for
productivity growth is how these imports are channelled
effectively into generating future income. This relates to

stand out.
First, developing countries that already have a minimum
level of technological capabilities are engaging in extensive trade in capital goods with other countries of the
South. This points to the importance of some level of
technological capabilities to participate in capital goods
trade, underscoring the fact that while any country can
import capital goods, those that consistently participate
in trade in such goods use many of these imports to
enhance their production capacities._ The second trend,

goods. Hence, a sub-set of developing countries that
already possess some level of technological capabilities
are able to leverage ongoing trade and investment to further boost their technological capabilities and innovation
capacities.
This does not completely exclude the presence and importance of technological transactions in other countries
of the South. But it points to an important result that

of many developing countries, with a particular focus on
factors that promote technological learning and innovation capabilities in those countries. Such a shift should
be consistent with their comparative advantages and local demand. This challenge in leveraging technological
learning through ongoing economic growth processes
is demonstrated by the analysis of data and case study
evidence in TIR 2012. The conclusions that lend strength

These results point to two fundamental issues. First,

A critical shift in South-South collaboration on technology and innovation is needed, with a focus on promoting technological learning based on the South’s own rich
and diverse experiences, as highlighted in the Report.
Some of the means of such learning, such as technology
transfer, have been demanded by developing countries
in the international discourse for decades. Technological development implies more than just promoting the

which promotes technological progress.
Mechanisms for technological collaboration have traditionally focused on a North-South dimension, but there
are also opportunities to develop South-South mechanisms for the sharing of experiences on technological
capacity-building and transfer. Indeed, these could
be particularly appropriate in the developing-country
context, given that these countries share common

need technological innovations and platforms that promote a smoother transition towards a green economy,
help address climate change mitigation and adaptation,
encourage the use of sustainable energy and renewable

eration between countries of the South:
i.

Such cooperation would help the
South to decouple from the global
cyclical trends of growth, thereby
promoting a new form of stability in
the global economic system; and

ii. Since the emerging countries are
still in their development phase, they
are better placed to understand the
problems of development, particularly in the current global context, and
could provide a new model for cooperation and technical assistance.

These views are discussed in greater detail
here.

CHAPTER I : THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SOUTH

C. THE IMPORTANT
ROLE OF THE SOUTH
IN TECHNOLOGICAL
LEARNING AND
INNOVATION
Current growth trends, and the related expansion of South-South trade and investment has created an interest in how and
to what extent developing countries could
help build technological capabilities in the
developing world. But the literature on this
   &= &
 %& 
scarce, and generally focuses on pressing international challenges, such as public
health and climate change.0? Internationally,
however, this remains a critical issue where
much more needs to be done, especially in
the context of the widening technological divide and growing concerns about the global

 ( !7D"

regime and how it limits the possibilities for
the poorest developing countries to design
their catch-up strategies.0_
In the classical development economics discourse, economic growth is considered to
be a process of related factors that shift the

Regardless, these mutually supportive

much still needs to be done in order to
harness this critical relationship in developing countries. For instance, an argument that has often been advanced is

a particular focus on factors that promote
technological learning and innovation capabilities in these countries. These actions
should be consistent with their comparative
advantages and local demand.
Much of the mainstream literature on
growth and decoupling does not deal with
technological development in depth, but
calls for a critical analysis of the technology
implications of such processes.02 It seems
prudent to assume that even if decoupling
were to be achieved, technological learning and capabilities-building would not be
an automatic result. In the worst case, it
could even entrench the lagging countries

In the context of
developing countries,
economic growth, on
the one hand, and
technology and
innovation capacity on
the other has a mutually
reinforcing relationship.

However, these mutually
supportive linkages
do not emerge
spontaneously; much
still needs to be done
in order to harness this
critical relationship.

of the TIR 2012 is that
developing countries,

In order to overcome these limitations proactive policies are needed at various levels.
Emerging countries have used a variety of
measures to overcome trade and intellectual property barriers in their own economic
development, which can provide important
lessons for other developing countries.
Their successful experiences show not only
how technological capabilities could be
built, but also what policy measures could
potentially be used to promote national

2. Overcoming challenges and

Many developing countries still face enormous challenges in achieving poverty

Added to these are more recent and pressing concerns such as those induced by
climate change and the need for a shift to
a green economy. Furthermore, a number
of emerging countries, despite being on a
trajectory of industrial catch-up are under
pressure to pursue inclusive and sustainable development, particularly with respect
to mitigating climate change. Bearing this
in mind, the discourse on the role of devel-

Technological change and economic growth

existing technologies by means of local innovations, and thus leads to a gradual increase

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2012

An important aspect of South-South trade
in capital goods is that it varies considerably,
both across groups of countries and between
individual countries. As observed with overall
imports from each region, there are also other
intraregional and intra-country variations. An
analysis of interregional variations shows that
the South-East Asian countries and South

South-South trade and South-South trade
in capital goods also follow a similar pattern with South Asia and South-East Asia
accounting for the highest share of intraSouth trade and capital goods imports._
This implies a growing capacity in the South
to produce such goods, at least in some
countries, but also that there is a growing trend in other developing countries to
import these as part of their expanding efforts to promote productive capacity. As
noted earlier, such imports are important
for building productive capacity, since they
can result in the transfer of technology to
the extent that those are studied for design
characteristics and reverse engineering.
They can also directly improve productivity when they are employed in production
processes. This is captured in part by the

the trends show that countries with an already existing minimum level of technological capabilities are engaging in extensive
trade in capital goods with other countries

of some level of technological capacity to
participate in capital goods trade, underscoring the fact that while any country could
import capital goods, those that consistently participate in such capital goods trade
are the countries where these imports feed
into enhancing production capacities.6 This
is underscored by the second trend, which

imports are channeled
effectively into
generating future
income.

C. IMPLICATIONS OF
ONGOING SOUTHSOUTH EXCHANGE
FOR TECHNOLOGY
AND INNOVATION
CAPACITY
A brief summary of the emerging picture
on South-South technology and innovation
brings out the following facts. The surge
of economic growth in developing countries, particularly emerging countries, has
been made possible in large parts by their
growing technological capabilities. This is
evidenced by the increase in their capital

goods exports in recent times. Although
capital goods imports by developing countries is a growing trend, and is considered
to be an indication of technological learning, the trends presented in section B show
that a large share of the capital goods exported and imported is concentrated in a
sub-set of developing countries. These are
countries that have some level of technological capabilities to integrate into GPNs,
and their level of economic growth enables
them import capital goods imports into the

exporters of capital goods.

The FDI thus helps
to cement and further
their technological
capacity as part of
existing production
networks.

A large share of the
capital goods exported
and imported is also
concentrated in a
sub-set of developing
countries.

A. INTRODUCTION
Building further on the trends analysed in
chapter II, this chapter assesses ongoing
South-South technological collaboration
based on several examples. Such collaboration can be broadly divided into the
following three categories: public-sectorbased, private-sector-based and public     !DDD"    

This chapter presents examples of the
three categories of South-South technological collaboration described above. Section

As shown in chapter II, technology and innovation patterns are not independent of
ongoing trade and investment patterns of
countries, and are often a component within
existing relations. The review conducted in
this chapter also shows that, while there are
a number of instances of ongoing technological collaboration, they focus largely on
pharmaceuticals and health, or on RETs,
climate change and agriculture. These collaborations are driven to a large extent by
government incentives, such as investment

technology and innovation can be attributed to the ongoing discourse on technology access and capacity-building at the international level, particularly also as part of
the North-South discourse. This is a positive development, implying greater publicsector-driven South-South collaboration on
technology and innovation. But at the same
time, the review of various existing declarations and regional agreements shows the
following:

in chapter II, based on the rising technology absorptive capabilities in some of the
developing countries. The analysis in this
chapter shows that while there is a trend
towards greater development assistance
and an increasing emphasis on collaboration in technological learning in government pronouncements, greater efforts are
needed for implementation. Existing cases
of South-South technological collaboration
presented in this chapter show that, when
designed appropriately, such collaboration can indeed lead to capacity-building in
countries. Hence, it is imperative to ensure
that such an effort is promoted in a more
systematic way through coherent policies.

First, the South has become a major exporter of technology-intensive capital goods to
various developing countries. However, at
present, South-South trade relationships
are dominated by countries that have the
capacity to absorb and participate in the
creation of new technological products
and processes.0 As a result, most of these
transactions occur between emerging
countries themselves, and are determined

Second, there is some level of technological
collaboration between developing countries
that feeds into technological learning processes and helps to build innovation capacity. As chapters II and III have shown,
these exchanges have been contributing in
various ways to building innovation capabilities in the developing world. However,

iii. Weak institutional linkages

Without such support,
access to knowledge
remains, at best, access
to information, since the
actors lack the capacity
to build further upon it.

There is an overwhelming agreement on
the central role of institutions in promoting
innovative capacity within a given system.

in setting priorities for technology and innovation to respond to the needs of their

As opposed to a more traditional approach
to science and technology, the past decade
has seen a sweeping shift towards science,
technology and innovation policies, with a
greater emphasis on how investments and

endowments in science can be used to
build technology and innovation capacity.

the economy, and that industrial development
is holistic in nature. It derives from a cohesive
environment that supports investment, innovation and technological learning, and export
competitiveness. It is therefore important to
eliminate sectoral biases which may be inimical to the process of promoting technological capabilities, and instead build as broad a
technological learning base as possible.
A second important lesson learnt that is
relevant in this context is that many technologies are interdependent in ways that
cannot be predicted ex-ante. For example, competencies such as those gained

the chapter elaborates the operational details
of the proposed SITEP which could help implement several of the principles described in
the chapter. This includes the sharing of innovation experiences and the promotion of joint
responses to common technological needs.

In order to achieve the
best results, the SITEP
should be coordinated
with other ongoing
regional and

this Report has sought to contribute new
policy insights in this complex area.

implications for policy and practice. Firstly,
the analysis shows that there are a large
number of ongoing projects and initiatives
for technology exchange among developing
 &  L>* (   =ated and private-sector-based, which vary
in scale and scope. The data and trends

advantage of South-South collaboration is
that it offers a choice to developing countries to tailor their partnerships in a way that
certain broader social and economic goals
are served. In addition, emerging country
partners may have a better understanding
of the ways and means of overcoming innovation constraints facing other developing countries, and they may have more
cost- and context-effective technologies.

These advantages need to be consciously
exploited. In order to ensure that the current and projected trends in South-South
trade and investment assist in the broader
goal of learning and capabilities-building,
this Report has argued that technology and
innovation issues should be given priority in
the South-South discourse.
Secondly, in order to harness the potential of
South-South collaboration for bridging the
technology divide, the Report argues that,

broad normative principles; there needs to
be an understanding of the main issues and
opportunities available in this area. Existing
lessons on how best to promote technological change in the developing-country
context offer an automatic starting point to
understand and foster South-South cooperation in this area. But at the same time,
there are some outstanding issues that re Z        (    
