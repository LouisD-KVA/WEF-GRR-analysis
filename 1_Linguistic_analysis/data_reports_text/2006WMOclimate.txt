FOREWORD

Climate monitoring is based on long-term observations
and century-long instrumental measurement records
of the various climate elements, including temperature,
precipitation, pressure and winds. Proxy data derived
from ice core samples, tree rings and other sources of
paleo-climatological information enable us to extend
climate change studies several thousands years into the
past. Annual climate reviews on global, regional and
national scales are nowadays necessary everywhere
for all nations to keep a close watch on the state of their
climate systems. This can be achieved by recording
and reporting the observed climate trends, anomalies
and extremes, and setting them within their historical
backgrounds, thereby bringing out any “unusual”
characteristics in terms of the climate system and
highlighting how they may fit into the existing scientific
knowledge. This procedure also provides a series
of annual climate facts for all parts of the world that
can serve the research community for inter-regional
comparison studies and to better understand the
behaviour of the climate system.
The present climate review shows that the global
surface temperature continued to increase in 2006,
which ranks among the top six warmest years since
1850. There is evidence that the beginning of the
twenty-first century continues to dominate the top
10 warmest years. In addition, extreme events, including
new record-breaking temperatures, continued to be
observed in several parts of the world, together with
serious damage and impacts upon lives, goods and
infrastructure.
The improved in-situ and space-based observing
networks and platforms have certainly increased our
ability to monitor the various components of the climate
system and to detect changes with good accuracy and
resolution. This is particularly evident when monitoring
sea ice extent, for which 2006 continued the previous
sharply decreasing records for the fifth consecutive
year. In this trend, it is worth mentioning that minimum
sea ice extent was recorded in 2006, second only
to that of 2005, a reduction that generally occurs
yearly in September. This fact provided an alarming
signal on the rapid rate of Arctic sea ice depletion.
Monitoring of climate elements and phenomena goes
in parallel with that of the chemical composition of the
atmosphere and the oceans, as we need to determine

the various sources and sinks of greenhouse gases. In
this respect, it is noteworthy that the 2006 preliminary
globally averaged atmospheric CO2 concentration was
381.1 ppm, about 2.3 ppm larger than the 2005 global
annual mean, and that, while there has been an average
annual increase of 1.6 ppm yr–1 since 1980, the average
rate of increase since 2000 has been 2.1 ppm yr–1.
Despite the fact that monitoring of the climate system
has improved throughout the past decades and
has been reinforced by space-based observations,
numerous remaining uncertainties in climate change
studies need to be addressed in various ways, including
the continued development of climate observations
and measurements to bridge the gaps in the existing
networks. This should help to address adequately any
pending scientific issues, such as model calibration and
validation for downscaling studies. In fact, these studies
will be amongst those most needed during the coming
years. In this regard, while working with its Members
on the development of their observing networks and
the improvement of their climate monitoring and
prediction capabilities, WMO has embarked on an
enhanced integration of its global observing systems,
in parallel with the planning and implementation of the
WMO Information System. The combination of these
efforts will allow the development of an integrated
WMO end-to-end system of systems, designed to
improve Members’ capabilities to effectively provide
a widening range of services and to better serve
research requirements.
To help increase awareness of climate issues, several
pertinent meetings were held in 2006, of which two
major ones concerned the use of climate information.
The first was the WMO Conference on Living with
Climate Variability and Change: Understanding the
Uncertainties and Managing the Risks, held in Espoo
(Finland) from 17 to 21 July 2006, which brought
together experts in natural disasters, public health,
energy and the built environment, water resources,
agriculture and food security, decision-related sciences,
and policy and climate. The Espoo conference gave
participants the opportunity to exchange views and thus
be able to advise on how to improve policy formulation
and operational decision-making in climate-sensitive
sectors, on the basis of more widespread use of climate
knowledge and information on managing risks and

vi

exploiting opportunities. The other major event was
the twelfth session of the Conference of the Parties to
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change, held in Nairobi from 6 to 17 November 2006,
during which a programme was adopted entitled
“Nairobi work programme on impacts, vulnerability
and adaptation to climate change”. One of the two
objectives of the programme is to assist countries in
making informed decisions on practical adaptation
actions and measures to respond to climate change
on a sound, scientific, technical and socio-economic
basis, taking into account current and future climate
change and variability. In this respect, WMO and the
National Meteorological and Hydrological Services of
its Members provide scientific and technological tools
for adaptation and decision-making, through the use of
climate information, for the benefit of various climate
sensitive sectors such as water, health, agriculture and
the development process in general. The continuing
important role of the media in covering weather and
climate extremes should also be underlined as well as
international, regional and national meetings, which are
instrumental in raising awareness among the general
public on climate change and its impacts.

I would also like to emphasize that the review of the
climate system provided here is a more detailed
version of the WMO Statement on the Status of the
Global Climate in 2006 (WMO-No. 1016), which was
published in March 2007. With its comprehensive
analysis and description of the major climate anomalies
and extreme events, it should be of great use to WMO
Members, partner organizations and other institutions
and individuals interested in authoritative climate
information. Together with the preceding issues, this
review forms a valuable series of ‘’State of the climate’’
publications. I am confident that it will assist readers
in their work and research.

ABSTRACT

A. ARGUEZ

The State of the Climate in 2006 report summarizes the
year’s weather and climate conditions, both globally
and regionally. In addition, the year is placed into a
long-term climatological context. Furthermore, notable
events are also discussed.

In addition, Antarctic ozone concentrations reached
an all-time minimum, while carbon dioxide measurements increased in the atmosphere by 2.3 parts per
million (ppm) in 2006 to reach a global average of
381.1 ppm.

Overall global temperatures were fifth or sixth warmest
on record, depending on the dataset, continuing an
upward trend in temperatures. Many countries and
regions experienced their record warmest year (or tied for
warmest), including Spain, the Netherlands, the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and China,
as well as parts of Australia and Canada. In many regions,
the warmth in 2006 is statistically indistinguishable
from the record warmth in 1998. However, 1998 was
influenced by the unprecedented warming associated
with the record 1997/98 El Niño, whereas 2006 was
marked by a 2005/06 La Niña that transitioned into a
weak-to-moderate 2006/07 El Niño.

In the global oceans, sea levels were above average
for approximately 80 per cent of the ocean. The global
mean sea level anomaly change of +6 mm from
2005 was the highest increase since the altimeter
record began in 1993. Relative sea level change
was also the highest ever recorded. Significant
heat flux and current anomalies were observed in
the regions of the 2006 El Niño and Indian Ocean
dipole mode event.

Consistent with the warming, sea ice extent in both
polar regions reached record or near-record minima.

Despite the warmth around the globe, tropical cyclone
counts were near average. However, Tropical Cyclone
Larry made landfall in northern Australia as one of the
most intense storms in decades. Following the record
Atlantic hurricane season of 2005, the 2006 season
was very quiet.

1. INTRODUCTION

A. ARGUEZ, A. M. WAPLE, and A. M. SANCHEZ-LUGO

On the heels of 2005’s record-breaking weather events,
2006 was also a year of records. This was especially
the case over the polar regions, where the largest
Antarctic ozone hole on record occurred in 2006. Sea
ice extent in the Antarctic reached records at times
for both maximum and minimum extent, and in the
Arctic, scientists observed the second lowest sea ice
extent on record (lowest 2005). These record events
came as attention to the polar regions gained greater
focus, thanks in large part to the International Polar
Year, in which an unprecedented effort is underway
to monitor the Arctic and Antarctic from March 2007
through March 2009.
Several countries had their warmest year on record
in 2006. These included, but were not limited to, China,
the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Parts
of Australia also reported record warmth, while Canada
and the United States of America experienced their
second-warmest year on record. There was a transition
between La Niña in the first half of the year to a weakto-moderate El Niño in the latter half. While some
regions had temperature and precipitation anomalies
consistent with typical ENSO (see page 137 for a
complete list of acronym expansions) impacts, it is
noteworthy that the record warmth experienced over
many parts of the world was not the result of a strong
El Niño, as was the case in 1998. Record rainfall over
parts of eastern Africa brought widespread damage
to the region in 2006, while Australians were “Larried,”
as some Aussies said, referring to the destruction left
behind by Tropical Cyclone Larry, including the near
decimation of the banana crop.
This summary highlights the most salient weather
events and overall climate conditions of 2006, which
include noteworthy weather events (e.g., floods,
tropical cyclones, tornadoes, and heat waves), assessments of temperature and precipitation anomalies,
and reports on some of the primary features of the
global climate system such as the Indian monsoon,
the Siberian high, the Kuroshio and the Gulf Stream
(western boundary currents in the North Pacific and
North Atlantic Oceans, respectively), the ITCZ, and
various jet streams. To the greatest extent possible,
the conditions in 2006 are placed in historical context
to provide perspective on variations and change that
have occurred through time. The data and analyses
contained herein represent the best available as of
early 2007; values are susceptible to updates by the

source agencies, although it is not expected that any
key findings would be materially affected.
This is the 17th annual State of the Climate report, the
11th year the report has been included in BAMS, and
the second year it appears as a special supplement.
NOAA/NCDC has been responsible for the report’s
publication for seven years, although the report is truly
an international effort. For 2006, over 150 scientists
from around the world participated, as NCDC continued
to focus on widening international participation. As
part of this effort, special “country spotlight” sidebars
are included in the report, highlighting the 2006 climate
events in six countries: Morocco, Mozambique, Cuba,
Armenia, Turkey, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. A
determined effort has been made to ensure that all
participants are duly acknowledged. In particular,
authorship is noted for individual sections. In addition
to authors, numerous reviewers and other facilitators
have made the publication possible; these individuals
are also listed in the acknowledgments section.
With every new State of the Climate report, new topics
and special features are incorporated. For 2006, the
following new sections are included: cloudiness, aerosols, global winds, ocean salinity, and ocean colour.
These additions represent a marked increase in the
number of “essential climate variables” covered by the
report. Our ability to observe global climate elements
has been dramatically increased by satellite observations, and this improvement will likely continue as new
instruments are placed in orbit. Also new for 2006 are
sections on teleconnections and blocking, the Atlantic
ITCZ, and a significantly augmented treatment of the
Antarctic. The Australian tropical cyclone season also
is discussed in a special sidebar.
The following is an executive summary of the report’s
five main sections.

SECTION 2: GLOBAL CLIMATE
• Continued global warmth marked 2006. The
10 warmest years on record have all occurred since
1995, with 2006 ranking fifth or sixth warmest in
the 1880–2006 record, depending on the dataset
analysed. All datasets agree that global surface
temperatures continue to warm, with the rate of
global temperature rise increasing from around

0.06°C decade –1 over the past century to nearly
0.18°C decade –1 for the last 30 years.
• Northern Hemisphere snow cover extent was
again below average for spring, and was near to
slightly above average for winter in 2006.
• Global precipitation was above average in
2006 for the third consecutive year. Precipitation
has increased globally since the start of the
twentieth century, with the greatest increases in
the middle and high latitudes of the Northern
Hemisphere.
• The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increased by 2.3 ppm in 2006 to reach a
global average of 381.1 ppm. The average rate of
rise is 1.6 ppm yr–1 since 1980; however, since the
year 2000, this has increased to 2.1 ppm yr–1. Prior
to the Industrial Revolution, the atmospheric concentration was around 280 ppm.

recorded, reaching an average late-September
extent of 27.4 million km2. At the South Pole itself,
ozone depletion reached 99% in early October, the
most on record.
• Both the record minimum and record maximum
sea ice extents relative to the 1979–2006 period
were included in 2006 (the period of accurate satellite observations).
• Seasonal minimum sea ice extent in the Northern
Hemisphere (typically occurring in September)
was again near record low levels. The September
rate of sea ice decline is now near 9% decade –1,
equating to a loss of over 60 000 km2 of ice extent
per year.

SECTION 6: REGIONAL CLIMATES
Numerous noteworthy climate events occurred in 2006
on the regional scale (Figure 1.1).

SECTION 3: GLOBAL OCEANS
• Annual mean SLA was above the 1993–99 baseline
average for nearly 80% of the ocean. The global
mean SLA change of +6 mm from 2005 was the
highest increase since satellite altimeter measurements began in 1993. Relative sea level change
was also the highest ever recorded.
• Significant heat flux anomalies were observed in
the regions of the 2006 El Niño and Indian Ocean
dipole mode event.

SECTION 4: THE TROPICS
• There were a near-average number of major (very
strong) tropical cyclones worldwide. Certain basins were more active than normal, for example,
the eastern tropical Pacific. The tropical Atlantic
had near-average activity, though in sharp contrast to 2005 there were few landfalls.
• A transition occurred from La Niña in the first
quarter of the year to El Niño conditions during
the last quarter of the year.

SECTION 5: THE POLES
• Springtime ozone depletion over the Antarctic in
2006 was, by a small margin, the most severe ever

• AFRICA: Precipitation was generally above average
over much of sub-Saharan Africa. Flooding caused
substantial loss of life and property, including
over eastern Africa, which had been grappling
with a multiyear drought before the deluge. Flooding also wreaked havoc in Nigeria, Malawi, and
Algeria. Temperatures were above average for
most of the continent.
• NORTH AMERICA: Canada and the United States
experienced one of their two warmest years
on record. Heavy rainfall fell over the
Northwest, Great Lakes, and New England
regions of the United States, while much of the
interior faced intense drought conditions.
Mexico was warmer than normal and slightly
wetter than average.
• CENTRAL AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN: Much of the
region was dry and warm. The lack of rain was attributable in part to the lack of tropical cyclones
impacting the region, as well as the emergence of
El Niño late in the year.
• SOUTH AMERICA: The overall weather conditions
varied from very wet to very dry. However, the
year was warm throughout most of the continent.
Classical ENSO teleconnections, as well as modulation by the MJO, were observed.

• ASIA: Russian temperatures were anomalously
warm, especially in December when records
were broken, including in Moscow. However,
January was very cold across the country.
China experienced its warmest year on record
and rainfall deficits. The Indian monsoon onset
commenced in the fourth pentad in May. Heat
waves struck parts of South Asia in May and
June.

• EUROPE: Europe was unusually warm, with new
high-temperature records set in many countries.
A summer heat wave and a very warm autumn
contributed to this warmth.
• OCEANIA: Parts of Australia were the warmest on
record. Many locations were impacted by severe
drought and tropical cyclones, including TC Larry,
which was one of the strongest storms to hit
Australia in decades.

OVERVIEW A. HORVITZ

Anomalous warmth continued at the surface and
throughout the troposphere in 2006. The global annual
average surface temperature in 2006 ranked as either
the fifth or sixth highest, depending on the dataset
used. Worldwide, land surface temperatures ranked
as fourth highest on record according to NOAA/NCDC,
and SSTs ranked as the fifth highest. The annual global
mean low- to midtroposphere anomaly for 2006 was
the third to fifth warmest (depending on the dataset)
since records began in 1958.

Global land surface precipitation was above average
in 2006 with an annual anomaly 34.0 mm (3.0%) above
the 1961–90 mean. Over the tropical Pacific, weak El
Niño conditions developed during mid-2006 and lasted
through the rest of the year. However, the coupling
between the warmer-than-normal SST and the
atmosphere did not materialize fully and no discernable
ENSO signature was evident in the precipitation
anomaly pattern. The 12-month running means of NH
snowfall extent were below the long-term average
throughout the year, continuing the trend since the
late 1980s. The preliminary globally averaged
atmospheric CO2 mole fraction in 2006 was approximately
2.3 ppm greater than the 2005 global annual mean.
New to 2006, this section also provides a summary
for global cloudiness, aerosols, and global winds. Also
included is a report on teleconnection patterns and
blocking reflecting large-scale changes in the atmospheric wave and jet stream patterns, which influence
temperature, rainfall, storm tracks, and jet stream
location and intensity over vast distances.

GLOBAL TEMPERATURE

SURFACE TEMPERATURE
M. J. MENNE and T. C. PETERSON

The global annual average surface temperature in
2006 ranks as either the fifth or sixth highest according to analysis conducted independently at institutions
in the United States and United Kingdom. As shown
in Figure 2.1, the global value for 2006 ranks as the
fifth highest on record according to NOAA/NCDC and
NASA’s GISS, and as the sixth highest according to
the University of East Anglia Climate Research Unit

(CRU)/Met Office (UKMO) Hadley Centre estimate.
Calculated as a linear trend, the rates of temperature
change since 1901 are 0.064°, 0.066°, and 0.073°C
decade –1 for the NOAA/NCDC, NASA GISS, and CRU/
UKMO analyses, respectively. However, the temperature change is not linear, and the rise from 1979 to
2006 is approximately 0.17°C decade –1 according to
all three sources (Figure 2.2).
All three global temperature analyses combine air
temperature data over land with SST. The NOAA/NCDC
surface temperature analysis is described in Smith
and Reynolds (2005), the NASA GISS analysis is

described in Hansen et al. (2001), and the CRU/MO
(HadCRUT3) analysis is described in Brohan et al.
(2006). Because the analyses make use of different
data reconstruction and interpolation approaches,
they differ most in regions with sparse data. Where
data are plentiful and for global averages the three
analyses agree well with each other and with the other
historical “global” temperature time series shown in
Figure 2.3. While the underlying data sources for all
the time series differ widely, the high degree of trend
consistency among them, since 1901, increases the
confidence that the changes they depict are robust
(Sommerville et al. 2007).

Worldwide, surface air temperatures over land rank
as the fourth highest on record according to the
NOAA/NCDC record, and SSTs ranked as the fifth
highest (not shown). Warming has occurred in both
land temperatures and SST. As might be expected
given the heat capacity of oceans, land temperatures
have risen at over twice the ocean rate since 1979
(about 0.30°C decade –1 versus 0.12°C decade –1).
The geographic distribution of annual temperature
anomalies is shown in Figure 2.4. Regionally, 2006
temperatures were the highest or near highest on
record in the United States, Canada, China, the United
Kingdom, Spain and the Netherlands, as well as parts
of Australia. These events are discussed in detail in
the regional climate sections (see section 6).

The NOAA/NCDC, CRU/MO, and NASA GISS time series are
expressed as anomalies from the 1961–90 mean (°C). Each of the
other time series was originally presented as anomalies from the
mean temperature of a specific, but differing base period. To make
them comparable, the historic time series have been adjusted
such that the mean of their last 30 yr is identical to the equivalent
period in the NOAA/NCDC anomaly time series. All series have
been smoothed using a 13-point filter.

UPPER-AIR TROPOSPHERIC TEMPERATURES
J. C. CHRISTY

The temperature variations of three broad atmospheric
layers, the low to midtroposphere (LT; surface to
300 hPa), the midtroposphere to lower stratosphere
(MT; surface to 70 hPa), and the upper troposphere to
lower stratosphere (LS; 150–20 hPa) are monitored by
two observing systems—radiosondes and satellites.
Three radiosonde-based products are available—
HadAT2 (Thorne et al. 2005), based on about
650 stations; RATPAC (Free et al. 2005), based on
85 stations; and RAOBCORE (version 1.4; Haimberger
2007), based on about 1100 stations. Satellite products
for LT, MT, and LS are from the UAH (Christy et al.
2003; Spencer et al. 2006; version 5.2 LT, version 5.1
MT; and LS) and RSS (Mears et al. 2003; Mears and
Wentz 2005; version 3.0). An MT dataset from UMD
(Vinnikov et al. 2006) is also included. “Annual” is

Radiosonde datasets are characterized by more limited coverage with few data south of 50°S latitude and little in oceanic areas.

The use of the 100–50-hPa layer as an approximation for the satellite LS layer leads to slightly more negative trends because the temperature trend below
100 hPa, which makes up a portion of the LS signal, is positive but not included in the 100–50-hPa layer.

UAH coverage is 85°S–85°N, RSS 70°S–85°N. UMd MT covers 82.5°S–82.5°N. Since less warming has been observed in the high southern latitudes,
their inclusion tends to reduce “global” trends, for example, the UAH “global” LT trend is 0.02°C decade –1 more positive if limited to 50°S–85°N.

Through 2005 only

defined as the period from December through
November (otherwise known as the meteorological
year).
The annual global mean LT anomaly for 2006 was the
third to fifth warmest among the datasets since records
began in 1958 (Figure 2.5), about 0.2°C cooler than
the warmest year of 1998. All datasets are consistent
with global trend values of +0.16 ±0.03°C decade –1
since 1979 and +0.14 ±0.01°C decade –1 since 1958
(Table 2.1). Note that the datasets are constructed
using independently developed methodologies.
Because none of these datasets claim precision better
than ±0.05°C decade –1, this level of agreement is very
encouraging, providing a relatively confident assessment of global LT trends.

respect to 1979–88. Trend values for two periods, beginning in
1958 and in 1979, are plotted on the right. The background color
of the right panels indicates the LT trend relative to the surface
trend (HadCRUT3) as being more positive (lavender) or negative
(light blue). [Source: H. Tichner, Hadley Centre]

A more visual interpretation of long-term change
suggests a relatively large increase in global
temperatures around 1977 and another shift to warmer
temperatures associated with the 1997/98 ENSO (Seidel
and Lanzante 2004). Since 1977 no seasonal anomaly
has dipped below –0.4°C, and since 2000 none has
dipped below the 1979/88 mean.
Regionally, the largest 2006 positive anomaly magnitudes occurred in the Arctic (not shown), where the
most positive trends since 1979 are also found, because
both UAH and RSS measure a trend greater than
+0.4°C decade –1 poleward of 60°N.
A similar picture is indicated for the MT layer (not
shown), which includes some stratospheric influence.
the rankings for 2006 place it from the third to the ninth
warmest among the datasets; however, the magnitude
of the temperature differences in this range is not
significant. Linear trends are more negative than for
the LT layer because of the influence of the cooling
stratosphere (Table 2.1).
The QBO shifted to the westerly or warm phase in
2006 and thus, tropical stratospheric temperatures
(LS) were warmer than those in 2005 by about +0.6°C.
Globally, the 2006 annual anomaly ranked from being
the coldest to the seventh coldest, with both satellite
datasets ranking 2006 as the second coldest. In particular, the south polar region was exceptionally cold
in autumn (SON) 2006, countering a series of recent
warm temperatures for that season (see 2005 report).
Linear trends are more variable among the datasets and
indicate that considerably more analysis is needed to
understand the differences and give better estimates
of confidence. Even so, all indicate significant cooling

Global land surface precipitation was above average
in 2006, with an annual anomaly that was 34.0 mm
(3.0%) above the 1961–90 mean (Figure 2.7a). It was
the most anomalously wet year since 2000, and the
eighth wettest year since reliable global records
began in 1900. On a seasonal basis only JJA was
drier than average. It was the fourth wettest DJF and
the second wettest boreal spring (MAM) on record
(Figures 2.7b and 2.7c, respectively). The DJF
and MAM anomalies were +16.7 (+6.5%) and
+13.9 (+4.7%) mm, respectively.
Precipitation patterns consistent with the presence
of La Niña conditions in early 2006 were evident in
some areas of the world (Ropelewski and Halpert
1987). In January, above-normal precipitation occurred
in much of the Maritime Continent, northern Australia,
and western Pacifi c. Precipitation was also above
average in parts of southern Africa. Also consistent
with La Niña was above-average winter rain and

Global precipitation anomalies determined from
land-based gauges were analysed on both an annual
and a seasonal basis using data from the GHCN
(Peterson and Vose 1997). Anomalies from 1900 to
2006 were determined from the GHCN dataset with
respect to the 1961–90 mean using those stations
with a minimum of 25 years of data during the
30-year base period (Vose et al. 1992). Highlights of
selected regional precipitation anomalies are also

Precipitation during JJA was 2.4 mm (0.6%) below
average, which is a drier-than-average pattern that
has occurred in all but 8 of the past 30 such seasons
(Figure 2.7d). The southwest monsoon season was
near average in total rainfall on the Indian subcontinent,
but periods of heavy rain resulted in record 24-h rainfall
totals in some locations. Heavy rains also fell in parts
of Africa. In much of Niger, the heaviest rainfall in
decades led to significant agricultural losses with tens
of thousands of people affected in August. Heavy rain
also caused devastating floods in Ethiopia in the same
month (see section 6B).
While JJA has largely been drier than average in recent
decades, much of the past decade has been wetter
than average during SON, and 2006 was no exception
(Figure 2.7e). Precipitation was 7.7 mm (2.4%) above
average, making this the 8th out of the past 10 SONs
that were wetter than average for the globe. A longlasting drought in the Greater Horn of Africa ended
with heavy rainfall and reports of the worst flooding
in 50 years from October through early December.
The worst-hit areas were in Ethiopia, Kenya, and
Somalia, where some stations received more than six
times their average monthly rainfall.
Conversely, severe drought continued in eastern
Australia in late 2006, as the rapid onset of El Niño
conditions in late August and September exacerbated
unusually dry conditions that had been present throughout much of the year. For many areas of Australia, the
lack of adequate rainfall in 2006 compounded longerterm dry conditions, with large regions not having yet
recovered from the droughts of 2002/03 and 1997/98
(Nicholls 2004). Dry conditions have now persisted for
5–10 years in many areas, and for almost three decades
in southwestern portions of western Australia.
Other areas of the world also have had an increasing
incidence of drought over the past three decades. The
percentage of the world affected by severe drought more
than doubled from approximately 10%–15% in the early
1970s to approximately 30% by 2002 (Dai et al. 2004).
Almost half of this increase has been linked to rising
surface temperatures. The increase in global surface
temperature of near 0.18°C decade–1 since the mid-1970s
(section 2B1) is thought to have increased the evaporation of moisture from many land areas. One significant
consequence has been that even though decreasing
trends in precipitation at regional scales were a factor

associated with increasing drought coverage in some
areas, the increase in areas affected by severe drought
occurred even while precipitation increased in most
regions of the world (Dai et al. 2004).
For global land areas as a whole, total annual precipitation increased at a rate of 0.59% decade –1 since the
mid-1970s and 0.19% decade –1 since the start of the
twentieth century. The largest increases have been
in the high latitudes of the NH. Although there has
been large decadal variability and periods of decreasing precipitation trends during the past century, the
monotonic trend averaged within the 55°–85°N latitude
band from 1900 to 2006 was approximately +1.2%
decade –1. During the same period precipitation
increased at a rate of 0.4% decade –1 in the midlatitudes
of the NH (30°–55°N) and 0.25% decade –1 in the midlatitudes of the Southern Hemisphere. A decreasing
trend near 0.4% decade –1 occurred from 10° to 30°N.
This in part reflected large negative trends over western and eastern Africa, where rainfall decreased at a
rate near 0.8% decade –1.

Precipitation over oceans P. Xie and J. E. Janowiak

Real-time monitoring of global oceanic precipitation
is conducted at NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center (CPC)
using the “CAMS-OPI” dataset (Janowiak and Xie 1999).
By combining the gauge observations of precipitation
collected and archived by CPC via the CAMS (Ropelewski
et al. 1985) with the satellite-based OPI (Xie and Arkin
1998), the CAMS-OPI database provides monthly
precipitation estimates over global land and ocean.
Several large-scale anomalies, discussed below, were
observed in 2006 (Figure 2.8, bottom panel).
The mean precipitation amount over the entire global
oceans during 2006 was 2.812 mm day–1, which is equivalent to a freshwater influx of 1026.4 kg m–2. Maximum
annual precipitation rates of over 9 mm day–1 were
observed over the tropical western Pacific where the
ITCZ merges with the SPCZ (near the equator and 150°E).
Relatively light precipitation was recorded over the oceanic dry zones in the southeast Pacific, the northeast
Pacific off the coast of the southwestern United States,
the southeast Atlantic, the tropical North Atlantic near
western Africa, and the southeastern Indian Ocean.
Over the tropical Pacific, weak (and at times moderate)
El Niño conditions developed during mid-2006 and

9
StateoftheClimate_2006.indd 9

lasted through the rest of the year. However, coupling
between the warmer-than-normal SST (see section
3b) and the atmosphere did not materialize fully, and
no discernable ENSO signature was seen in the
precipitation anomaly pattern. In fact, the precipitation
pattern in the tropical Pacific was more characteristic
of La Niña conditions. These include greater-thannormal rainfall east of the Maritime Continent and
over the ITCZ and SPCZ, and less-than-normal rainfall
over much of the central and eastern near-equatorial
Pacific (Figure 2.8). In contrast, a time-longitude
diagram of near-equatorial precipitation anomalies
(Figure 2.9) showed a steady eastward progression
of positive rainfall anomalies beginning in June 2006
that coincided with the developing El Niño conditions.
However, the eastward movement was restricted to
the area from 160°E to about 170°W.
Over the Indian Ocean, the precipitation distribution
during 2006 was characterized by a large negative
anomaly over the eastern por tion of the basin

between the equator and 20°S. This anomaly was
associated with a cold water mass that developed
during the second half of the year. In contrast, the
western portion of the Indian Ocean experienced
wetter-than-normal conditions that included the
entire Arabian Sea southward to Madagascar. This
anomaly pattern is indicative of the positive phase
of the Indian Ocean dipole pattern (Baquero-Bernal
et al. 2002).
The lower-than-normal rainfall over the Caribbean
Sea and the Gulf of Mexico (Figure 2.8) may have
been associated with the relatively inactive hurricane
season. Elsewhere, weak negative precipitation anomalies were observed over the northwestern Atlantic
Ocean during most of 2006.

and ranks 2006 as having the 27th most extensive cover
of record. This evaluation considers snow over the
continents, including the Greenland ice sheet. The SCE
in 2006 ranged from 47.7 million km2 in January to
2.2 million km2 in August. Monthly snow extent values
are calculated at the Rutgers–The State University of New
Jersey Global Snow Laboratory from weekly SCE maps
produced by NOAA meteorologists, who rely primarily
on daily visible satellite imagery to construct the maps.
Hemispheric SCE was above the long-term mean in
January, February, and October, but close to or below
the mean in all other months. Thus, the 12-month
running means of NH extent were below the long-term
average throughout the year (Figure 2.10). This has
almost exclusively been the situation since the late
1980s. Eurasian SCE was somewhat above the longterm average in 2006 and ranked as the 17th most
extensive cover of the satellite era. North American
SCE was much below average, ranking 36th, the second least extensive.
As is common, 2006 SCE showed significant variability
on temporal and spatial scales. For instance, hemispheric SCE ranked in the top 10 in January and

October, while totals ranked in the lowest 10 from May
through September, as well as in December. January’s
anomaly was positive as a result of Eurasian extent
being the second largest of record, despite North
America ranking 39th, or second least extensive.
October’s high ranking was the result of extensive
cover over both continents, following a late spring,
summer, and early fall, when both continents ranked
quite low. Spring and summer snow cover continues
to be less extensive in the second half of the satellite
record than in the first half (Figure 2.11). Lower-thanaverage North American SCE was first noted in North
America in April, while it was not until June that
Eurasian cover fell to well below average extent. Fall
and winter SCE continue to show considerable yearto-year variability, however there are no apparent
trends.
Over the contiguous United States, January SCE was
the second lowest on record, while April and November
ranked in the top 10 lowest. Meanwhile, October SCE
was the 14th largest. Alaskan cover ran close to average from January through summer’s end, and then
fell well below average during the fall.

CLOUDINESS A. HEIDINGER, A. EVAN, and B. BAUM

Cloudiness in 2006 was dominated by La Niña at the
beginning of 2006, and by El Niño at the end of the
year. The dataset used in this analysis of global
cloudiness is based on 25 years of data (1982–present) from the series of AVHRR imagers on the NOAA
polar-orbiting platforms, and is known as the AVHRR
PATMOS-x (information available online at http://
cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/clavr/patmosx.html).

Figure 2.10. Anomalies of monthly snow cover extent over Northern
Hemisphere lands (including Greenland) between November 1966
and December 2006. Also shown are 12-month running anomalies
of hemispheric snow extent, plotted on the seventh month of a
given interval. Anomalies are calculated from NOAA snow maps.
Mean hemispheric snow extent is 25.5 million km2 for the full period
of record. Monthly means for the period of record are used for
nine missing months between 1968 and 1971 in order to create a
continuous series of running means. Missing months fall between
June and October; no winter months are missing.

Figure 2.12 is a map of boreal winter cloudiness
(January–March) for 2006 in which the climatological
mean based on the PATMOS-x record for the same
months has been subtracted. Inspection of this figure
shows that the enhanced Pacific trade flow results in
a reduction in cloudiness across the equatorial eastern
Pacific that is caused by cooler-than-normal SSTs.
Also present is an increase in cloud amount in the
Indonesian region, consistent with the characteristic
warming of ocean temperatures that occurs during
a La Niña event. A slight cooling across the Indian
Ocean and the observed reduction in cloud amounts
during this period is also consistent with the negative
phase of an ENSO period.

Figure 2.13 provides similar analysis, but for the boreal
fall of 2006, consisting of the cloud amount for October,
November, and December. There is a sharp reversal
of cloud patterns across the equatorial Pacific associated with the onset of an El Niño event. The easing of
the easterly trade flow and the subsequent eastward
migration of warmer sea surface temperatures results
in the pattern of increased cloudiness along the eastern
equatorial Pacific, a drastic decrease in cloudiness
from northern Australia to Southeast Asia, and an
increase in cloudiness across the Indian Ocean. While
the departure from the mean state is more than a 10%
reduction in cloudiness in these regions, this anomaly

The year 2006 also featured an increase in high-level
cloudiness across much of southern Africa. This
anomaly was more prevalent and statistically significant in a map of annual mean high cloud anomalies
(Figure 2.14). These anomalies in high cloud amounts
are consistent with a strong monsoon observed toward

The CO2 emitted from fossil fuel burning is partitioned
into the following three mobile reservoirs: atmosphere,
oceans, and terrestrial biosphere. One result of fossil
fuel combustion has been that atmospheric CO2 has
increased from about 280 ppm at the start of the
industrial revolution to more than 380 ppm today.
Roughly half of the emitted CO 2 remains in the
atmosphere and the remainder has gone into the
following two sinks: oceans and the land biosphere
(which includes plants and soil carbon).

Currently, more than 7 Pg (Pg = 1015 g) of carbon is
emitted into the atmosphere by fossil fuel combustion
each year. During the 1990s, net uptake by the oceans
was estimated as 1.7 ±0.5 Pg yr–1 and by the land
biosphere as 1.4 ±0.7 Pg yr–1 (Prentice et al. 2001). The
gross fluxes between the atmosphere and oceans,
and the atmosphere and terrestrial biosphere
(photosynthesis and respiration), are on the order of
100 Pg yr–1. Interannual variations in the atmospheric
increase of CO2 (see Figure 2.15, based on Conway
et al. 1994) are because of small changes in these net
fluxes, not because of variations in fossil fuel emissions.
Most attempts to explain the interannual variability
of the atmospheric CO2 increase have focused on
short-term climate fluctuations (e.g., ENSO and post–
Mt. Pinatubo cooling), but the mechanisms, especially

since 2000 has been 2.1 ppm yr–1. This suggests that
the fraction of CO2 emitted from fossil fuel combustion
that remains in the atmosphere may be increasing.
NOAA ESRL launched the “Carbon Tracker” (information
online at www.ersl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/carbontracker),
a new tool that uses observations and a state-of-theart model to keep track of time-dependent emissions
and the uptake of atmospheric CO2 from both natural
and anthropogenic processes. For the period from
January 2001 to December 2006, Carbon Tracker
estimated that the uptake of carbon by North American
ecosystems averaged –0.65 ± 0.75 Pg C yr–1; this can
be compared to the total North American fossil fuel
emissions of 1.9 Pg C yr–1.

METHANE E. J. DLUGOKENCKY and R. C. SCHNELL

The CH4 contribution to anthropogenic radiative forcing, including direct and indirect effects, is about
0.7 W m –2 (about half that of CO2). Changes in the
burden of CH4 feed back into atmospheric chemistry,
affecting the concentrations of OH and O3. The increase
in CH4 since the preindustrial era is responsible for ~½
of the estimated increase in background tropospheric
O3 during that time. Changes in OH concentration
affect the lifetimes of other greenhouse gases, such
as the replacement refrigerants (HCFCs and HFCs).
High-precision measurements of atmospheric CH4
provide climate modelers with current and past rates
of CH4 increase, and they are also useful in constraining
the global CH4 budget and how it is changing with time.
This “top-down” approach can determine total global
emissions to within ±10%, but background atmospheric
observations alone cannot effectively quantify emissions from individual sources. A recent surprise in the
global CH4 budget was the report that vegetation can
be a significant source of atmospheric CH4, even under
aerobic conditions (Keppler et al. 2006). Our inability to
identify this source before now shows the limitations
of observations, particularly in the Tropics, for quantifying weakly emitting, diffuse sources.
In Figure 2.15b, CH4 mole fractions from the NOAA
observatory at Mauna Loa, Hawaii, are plotted as a
function of time. During more than 20 years of measurements CH4 has increased by nearly 10%, but the
rate of increase has slowed in recent years. A large
increase in 1998 and a smaller one in 2003 were likely

the result of climatic conditions that resulted in
increased emissions from biomass burning and natural
wetlands. Otherwise, atmospheric CH4 has remained
nearly constant (Dlugokencky et al. 2003). Possible
causes for the recent lack of growth in atmospheric
CH4 burden are decreased emissions from natural
wetlands because of widespread drought in the Tropics
(Bousquet et al. 2006), and a change in the CH4 sink
because of increased lightning (Fiore et al. 2006); but,
the exact causes are still unclear. Our preliminary
global annual CH4 average for 2006 of 1775.4 ppb is
only 3 ppb greater than that observed in 1999.
3)

CARBON MONOXIDE E. J. DLUGOKENCKY and R. C. SCHNELL

Unlike CO2 and CH4, CO does not strongly absorb terrestrial infrared IR radiation, but it still impacts climate
through its chemistry. The chemistry of CO affects
OH (which influences the lifetimes of CH4 and HFCs)
and tropospheric O3 (itself a greenhouse gas), so
emissions of CO can be considered equivalent to
emissions of CH4 (Prather 1996). Current emissions of
CO may contribute more to radiative forcing over
decadal time scales than emissions of anthropogenic
N2O (Daniel and Solomon 1998).
The CO mole fractions from Mauna Loa are plotted
as a function of time in Figure 2.15c and show little
trend over the period of these measurements (Novelli
et al. 2003). Superimposed on the flat trend are significant increases during 1997/98, and again in 2002/03,
which were likely the result of tropical (Langenfelds
et al. 2002) and boreal biomass burning (Kasischke
et al. 2000). Because the lifetime of CO is relatively
short (a few months), the anomaly quickly disappeared
and CO returned to pre-1997 levels shortly afterward.
In 2005, CO levels are comparable to those found in
the early 2000s.
The preliminary globally averaged CO mole fraction
in 2006 was 82.1 ppb, which is 1.1 ppb less than the
2005 global annual mean and 13.5 ppb lower than
1998, which had a large contribution from CO emitted
by biomass burning.

DECREASES IN OZONE-DEPLETING GASES AND THEIR
REPLACEMENTS S. A. MONTZKA and R. C. SCHNELL

Long-lived halocarbons affect the radiative balance
of the atmosphere because they efficiently absorb

14
StateoftheClimate_2006.indd 14

2/22/08 11:18:13 AM

terrestrial IR radiation. Halocarbons containing Br
and Cl also influence the radiative atmospheric balance
indirectly through their destruction of stratospheric
O3 (see section 5C).
Because of concerns over stratospheric O3 depletion,
the production of many halocarbons has been restricted
in recent years. The international phase-out of humanproduced halocarbons was brought about through
amendments and revisions to the 1987 Montreal
Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer.
As a result of these efforts, mixing ratios of many
ozone-depleting gases have been declining at the
Earth’s surface in recent years; this decline continued
in 2006 (Figure 2.16). It is now apparent from the
NOAA/ESRL/GMD measurements from around the
globe that tropospheric mixing ratios of CFC-12, the
longest lived and most abundant human-made ozonedepleting gas in the atmosphere, peaked within the
last few years and now has begun to decrease.
The NOAA/ESRL/GMD data show that mixing ratios
of some halogenated gases continue to increase globally (Figure 2.16). The most rapid increases are observed
for HCFCs and HFCs, which are chemicals commonly
used as replacements for CFCs, halons, and other
ozone-depleting gases. Although HCFCs contain Cl

Increases in HCFCs have slowed notably in recent
years; by mid-2006, the Cl in the three most abundant
HCFCs amounted to 227 ppt, or 8.4 % of all Cl carried
by long-lived halocarbons. Mixing ratios of HFC-134a
(1, 1, 1, 2-tetrafluoroethane), the most abundant HFC
in the global background atmosphere, increased nonlinearly in the 1990s during the period of early production
and use. From 2001 to 2006, however, it has increased
in the global troposphere at a fairly constant linear
rate of 4.3 ppt yr–1. Concern over increases in HFCs
stems in large part from the fact that these gases are
efficient absorbers of infrared radiation.
The influence of these disparate trends on future levels
of stratospheric O3 can be gauged roughly from a sum
of Cl and Br in long-lived halocarbons, provided the
enhanced efficiency for Br to destroy O3 is considered
[note that this efficiency factor has been updated here
to 60 based upon a reanalysis appearing in the latest
WMO Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion (Cunnold
et al. 2007)]. This sum is expressed here as EECl
(Figure 2.16), and is derived from surface-based
measurements. EECl provides an estimate of the

(ppt, or pmol mol –1) of the most abundant CFCs, HCFCs, HFCs,

are calculated from atmospheric measurements made at remote
sites in both the Northern and Southern Hemisphere (from the
NOAA/ESRL/GMD cooperative air sampling network). The middleright hand panel shows secular changes in atmospheric EECl (in
ppb or nmol mol –1), which is an estimate of the ozone-depleting
power of atmospheric halocarbons. EECl is derived from observed
mixing ratios of ozone depleting gases appearing in the other
4 panels, and it is derived from the sum of [Cl + (Br × 60)] contained
in these gases. The bottom panel shows the recent changes in
EESC observed by the NOAA/GMD global network relative to the
secular changes observed in the past, including the level observed
in 1980 when the ozone hole was first observed, and a projected
future. The Ozone Depleting Gas Index for midlatitudes is derived
(right-hand axis) from rescaling EESC. EESC is derived from EECl by
simply adding 3 yr to the time axis to represent the lag associated
with mixing air from the troposphere to the middle stratosphere,
where the ozone layer resides. [Source: S. A. Montzka, J. H. Butler,

ozone-depleting power of trace gases a few years in the
future, when air at the Earth’s surface will have become
mixed into the midlatitude stratosphere where the O3
layer resides. A second metric, ECl, provides an estimate
of the ozone-depleting power of trace gases in the near
future for the stratosphere over the polar regions (not
shown).
The observations indicate that the EECl and ECl content
of the lower atmosphere has declined fairly steadily
since the peak in 1994 to 2006 at a mean rate of 27–
29 ppt yr–1. Scenarios projecting future halocarbon
mixing ratios have been derived elsewhere based upon
full compliance with the fully amended and revised
Montreal Protocol and our understanding of the atmospheric lifetimes of these gases (Cunnold et al. 2007).
These analyses suggest that it will take 40–60 years
for EECl and ECl to decline to the levels present in 1980,
which is before O3 depletion was first observed. This
1980 level is notable, given that one might expect
nearly full recovery of stratospheric O3 once atmospheric EECl or ECl returns back to this level. The time
scale for O3 recovery will depend upon other factors
as well, however, such as stratospheric temperatures
and atmospheric aerosol loading. Nonetheless, the
declines in EECl from 1994 to the present represent a
significant drop in the atmospheric EECl burden; as of
2006 EECl had declined 20% of the way back down to
the 1980 level (lower panel of Figure 2.16).
Progress toward EECl returning to the abundance in
1980 can now be readily assessed with the NOAA
ODGI (online at www.cmdl.noaa.gov/odgi/ ). This index
is derived from EECl and ECl data for the midlatitude
and Antarctic stratosphere. The index is scaled so that
a value of 100 represents the EECl or ECl abundance
at its peak, and 0 represents the 1980 level (the level
at which no ozone depletion is expected, assuming
constancy in all other variables). In 2005, the ODGIMidlatitudes was 76.7, indicating that the abundance
of ozone-depleting substances have decreased nearly
25% of the way toward the levels that were present in
1980 (Figure 2.16). Less progress is evident for
Antarctica; ODGI-Antarctica was 87.6 in 2005, which
suggests halocarbon abundances have declined slightly
over 12% of the way down to 1980 levels.
Changes in the direct radiative influence of long-lived
halocarbons can be estimated from observed changes
in atmospheric mixing ratios with knowledge of

trace-gas radiative efficiencies. Such an analysis suggests that the direct radiative forcing of these gases
was still increasing in 2005, though at a much slower
rate than observed from 1970 through 1990.

THE COMBINED INFLUENCE OF LONG-LIVED TRACE
GASES ON THE RADIATIVE BALANCE OF THE
ATMOSPHERE S. A. MONTZKA and R. C. SCHNELL

Changes in the abundance of long-lived trace gases have
a direct and indirect influence on the energy balance of
the atmosphere. The direct radiative influence of a trace
gas is directly proportional to its atmospheric abundance
and how efficiently it absorbs infrared radiation in specific
regions of the electromagnetic radiation spectrum (its
radiative forcing). High-precision measurements of CO2,
CH4, N2O, CFC-12, and CFC-11 (the major greenhouse gases),
along with 10 minor greenhouse gases obtained from the
NOAA global air sampling network, have been used to
calculate the overall change in the direct radiative climate
forcing arising from the sum of all of these long-lived gases
(Hofmann et al. 2006) (Figure 2.17). This forcing is calculated
by considering changes in the abundances of these gases
since 1750. By mid-2005, the increases in the abundances
of all of these gases above 1750 levels amounted to an
additional radiative forcing to the atmosphere totaling
approximately 2.6 W m–2. Changes in the abundance of
CO2 since 1750 accounted for nearly two-thirds of this
enhanced radiative heating.
The NOAA AGGI has been developed based upon the
radiative forcing calculated from these NOAA measurements (Hofmann et al. 2006). The index is a ratio of radiative
forcing from all of these gases (based upon changes since
1750) relative to the radiative forcing calculated from these
gases for 1990, the Kyoto Protocol baseline year. By 2005,
the AGGI was 1.215, indicating that the direct radiative
forcing arising from increases in the abundance of these
trace gases had increased by 21.5% from 1990 to 2005
(Figure 2.17). Increases in the atmospheric abundance of
CO2 accounted for over 75% of the observed increase in
the AGGI from 1990 to 2005.

observatories. Molecules of N 2 O and SF 6 in the
atmosphere are 296 and 22,200 times more effective
infrared absorbers per molecule compared to CO2 over
a 100-year time horizon, respectively. However, the
concentrations of N2O and SF6 are just over 1000 and
60 million times lower than the atmospheric CO2
concentration, respectively. At the end of 2006, the

mean atmospheric concentrations of N2O and SF6
were 320 ppb and 6 ppt, respectively, as shown in
Figure 2.18. The current climate forcing relative to the
beginning of the industrial revolution (1750) for N2O
and SF6 is 0.16 and 0.002 W m –2, respectively. While
the climate forcing from SF6 is small, it has a longer
lifetime (500–3500 yr) than N2O (100 yr). Atmospheric
N2O also affects stratospheric O3 because it is the
source gas for stratospheric NO. Stratospheric NO
contributes to the NOx catalytic sink for stratospheric
O3 loss, which is dominant between 25 and 40 km.
Another striking feature of these greenhouse gases is
their almost linear growth rate over their full atmospheric
records (Figure 2.18). Atmospheric N2O and SF6 are
growing at 0.77 ppb yr–1 and 0.22 ppt yr–1, respectively.
Atmospheric N2O has both natural and manmade
sources, where the manmade sources (fertilizer usage,
catalytic reduction of fossil fuel emissions, by-products
of chemical processes, etc.) account for about 30% of
total emissions. Whereas SF6 is produced solely by
man, its usage is now considered essential as an insulator for the distribution of electric power (95%) with
minor usage in atmospheric tracer studies. There are
biennial and short-term changes in the atmospheric
growth rates of N2O and SF6 that are greater than ±25%.
These changes are related to varying source strengths

SF6 after 1996 is most likely the result of voluntary
recovery of SF6 by utility companies and elimination
of the use of SF6 as a compressed gas in automobile
tires, and the switch to the use of other gases or materials for bladders in the soles of athletic shoes.

AEROSOLS A. T. EVAN, N. M. MAHOWALD, and L. A. REMER

The global aerosol system in 2006 was both typical
and atypical of long-standing patterns. Figure 2.19
shows the annual mean AOD at 550 nm, calculated
from daily MODIS 10-km retrievals (Remer et al. 2005).
The AOD is a measure of the extinction of shortwave
radiation, and its global distribution is roughly equally
divided between dust, sulfates, and carbonaceous
aerosols, even though dust and sea salt dominate the
aerosol mass loading. This is because sulfates and
carbonaceous species are much more efficient in terms
of light extinction (Tegen et al. 1997). Note that the
standard MODIS algorithm does not retrieve either
over clouds, or over snow, ice, sunglint, or bright desert
surfaces. Thus, the aerosol distribution of Figure 2.19
is biased toward summer retrievals in high-latitude
and cloud-free high pressure systems.
For long time series analysis, we use data from longerflying satellites, for example, the AVHRR, since the
MODIS data record begins in 2000. Here we use the
870-nm AOD (Ignatov and Stowe 2002a,b) and dust
fraction (Evan et al. 2006) products from the Pathfinder
Atmospheres Extended dataset (online at http://cimss.
ssec.wisc.edu/clavr/patmosx.html). This dataset applies
a new calibration technique to the AVHRR imagers
(Heidinger et al. 2002), making it more apt for studying
long-term changes. However, aerosol activity over land
and in the presence of clouds is not detectable and
therefore must be inferred either by over-water clearsky retrievals or by comparison with MODIS retrievals.
We also include output from a reanalysis-driven transport model that includes mineral aerosol source and
deposition algorithms (Mahowald et al. 2003).

Saharan and Sahelian output

While some of the aerosols produced from this region
include carbonaceous aerosol from biomaburning,
biofuels, and urban sources, mineral dust provides the
bulk of the mass exported over the Atlantic Ocean.

the MODIS for 2006. Regions in gray denote missing values.

Mineral aerosols from west and central Africa have been
shown to account for ~50% of the global dust loading
(Luo et al. 2004) and, therefore, are responsible for ~20%
of the global aerosol optical thickness (Tegen et al. 1997).
Figure 2.20 is a plot of the changes in annual mean dust
concentration observed in Barbados (Prospero et al.
2003) and seen by the AVHRR for the western North
Atlantic (0°–30°N, 10°–60°W). According to the AVHRR
dust product, loadings over the western North Atlantic
were below the climatological mean for 2006 (this was
also found to be true over the Mediterranean). However,
this low level of activity is not statistically significant
and reflects a downward trend in the data over the last
20 years. Additionally, a strong downward trend in dust
is not seen in the Barbados data, which show an increase
in dustiness from the mid-1960s through the early 1980s,
and then a leveling off of dustiness. This disagreement
may simply result from comparing dust-frequency
satellite data of model output averaged over a large
area, with concentration amounts from a point source.
Model output also corroborates a decline in dust activity
for 2006, with amounts for January–October below the
climatological mean (1979–2005). The 2006 annual mean
AOD for this region from MODIS is the lowest of all
seven years in the MODIS record.

India

The Indo-Gangetic Plain in India consistently shows
elevated AOD that is a combination of locally produced pollution from urban/industrial aerosol, biofuel,
and biomass burning during the winter months, and
transported desert dust from both the Arabian and
Thar Deserts in the premonsoon and summer months.
The MODIS AOD shows that 2006 was typical in
terms of mean annual AOD, according to the seven
years of available data.

China and the Yellow Sea

Eastern China and the surrounding Yellow Sea contained some of the heaviest aerosol loading in 2006,
and is one of the few areas in the AVHRR data to show
a statistically significant departure (increase) from the
mean state in 2006. It is probable that dust from the
upwind deserts (whose activity peaks during boreal
spring) and urban/industrial aerosols from nearby
population centres contribute to these higher-thannormal aerosol concentrations. The MODIS data show
a strong increase in fine-mode aerosol amounts in
the summer of 2006, as well as an increase in coarsemode aerosol during April and May. This suggests
that the elevated aerosol amounts may result from
increases in dust aerosol during the spring and urban/
industrial aerosol or transported biomass burning
smoke during the summer. However, the increases in
2006 are corroborated neither by the model output,
which shows near-normal activity for 2006 in this
region, nor by observations made at Midway Island
(Prospero et al. 2003).

Aerosol optical thickness maps of the areas surrounding Indonesia show above-average aerosol

loadings for the boreal summer and fall that are
statistically significant. These elevated levels of
aerosols are likely the result of smoke from biomass burning. October 2006 has the highest single
monthly mean value of AOD in the entire 7-yr
MODIS record for this region. It is probable that the
positive-phase ENSO event and the accompanying
decrease in precipitation are key factors in this
increase of aerosol loadings (van der Werf et al.
2004). An analysis of aerosol values for the bodies
of water surrounding the Indonesian islands reveal
a similar (but much greater) response during the
ENSO event of 1997.
(v)

The MODIS AOD dataset shows high aerosol loading
over eastern Europe, Siberia, and the adjoining Arctic
Ocean. These aerosols were produced by the biomass
burning of agricultural lands and boreal forests in
Russia during May, transported across Scandinavia
and into the Arctic (Stohl et al. 2006). The MODIS
picture is slightly misleading. Because of snow and
ice cover, MODIS retrievals are possible only in a
limited part of the year. An aerosol event that occurs
in the short summer season will be exaggerated in
the annual mean values calculated from the MODIS
retrievals. The 2006 Siberian smoke season is the
second strongest in the 7-yr MODIS record, exceeded
only by the 2003 season. In contrast, boreal forest
smoke that was prevalent in North America in 2002
(Quebec, Canada) and 2004 (Alaska) is mostly absent
in 2006. Interannual boreal fires and the aerosols
they produce are almost entirely dependent on natural
causes that include precipitation and humidity patterns, soil moisture left from winter snow cover, and
lightning strikes. However, forest management practices also play a part.

2005 created one of the heaviest smoke seasons on
record in the Amazon. In 2006, continued drought in
the beginning of the season threatened a repeat of the
previous year. A combination of enforced fire regulations
changed cultural practices, and an early onset of the

1)

OCEAN SURFACE WINDS

Wind speeds for ice-free regions for the period from
July 1999 to 2006 are obtained using the SeaWinds
scatterometer on the QuikSCAT satellite. Technically,
this instrument also responds to changes in the air–sea
temperature difference; however, variability resulting
from temperature is usually relatively small compared
to changes in wind speed. Monthly averaged speeds
are determined for January 2000 through December
2006. The range of anomalies in 2006 is large, similar
to that of 2003 and 2004, and much greater than that
of 2000, 2001, and 2005. The month-to-month changes
in 2006 are also relatively large. Note that an increase
in wind speeds is typically associated with a greater
rate of transfer of energy from the ocean to the atmosphere. For low–wind speeds regions, such a change
would result in only an ~1 W m –2 change in the rate
of heat transfer. For high–wind speeds regions, the
change could exceed 5 W m –2, which integrated over
a month is a very large extra input of energy to the
atmosphere.

Northern oceans

Monthly anomalies in the NH show westerlies that
are stronger than usual for most of the year and
possibly shifted farther north than usual. Wind
anomalies in the Gulf of Alaska are indicative of
stronger westerly-to-southwesterly flow that lasted
from May into October. Late in the year, the North
Atlantic was dominated by a strong Icelandic low
(November and December). This resulted in stronger
winds throughout the ocean between Greenland
an d Eur op e . A n anomalou s r id g e n e ar the
eastern seaboard of the United States during the
same months is apparent in negative wind anomalies
and the resulting warm s tar t to the 20 06/07
winter.
(iii)

Southern Ocean

There are also long periods of increased wind in the
Southern Ocean. The most notable location is south
of Australia (May–July, September–December).
Examination of daily wind fields shows that some of
these greater wind speeds are associated with offshore flow from the eastern Antarctic ice dome. They
may be an indicator of stronger katabatic wind flow
from the interior of Antarctica. These katabatic flows
may not be directly responsible for the higher overocean winds, but they have been shown to increase
convergence and cyclogenesis in the circumpolar
trough. The result would be an increase in wind
speeds.

Tropics
2)

Some regional changes (Figure 2.21) in wind speeds
are steadier than suggested in the global average.
The El Niño–related atypical position of the SPCZ is
evident in the last half of the year. Similarly, from
June onward there are greater wind speeds in the
western Pacific Ocean warm pool and increased
westward winds in the eastern central Pacific Ocean.
There are also changes in the subtropical North
Atlantic related to an eastward displacement of the
Bermuda high, which could have contributed to the
reduction in the number of landfalling tropical
cyclones. Increased wind speeds in the western
subtropical Atlantic Ocean in September and October
are indicative of greater vertical wind shear, which
would also tend to inhibit the strengthening of tropical cyclones.

LAND SURFACE WINDS

Monthly wind speed anomalies (Figure 2.22) with
respect to the long-term mean (1968 –96) were
calculated from data obtained from the NCEP–NCAR
reanalysis (Kalnay et al. 1996). The oceanic wind
speed anomalies are qualitatively similar to the
QuikSCAT-derived wind speeds over the oceans and
ice edges especially in the polar regions. Differences
in spatial resolution between the two datasets
(QuikSCAT: ~0.25° versus NCEP–NCAR: ~2.5°) explain
the difference in magnitudes. It is important to note
that QuikSCAT winds are not assimilated into the
reanalysis product.
The wind speed anomaly patterns over most of
the world’s landmasses are small or inconsistent

magnitudes compared with the adjacent ocean.
Stronger-than-normal wind speeds persisted over
the Arc tic, including Greenland, Alaska, and
Siberia throughout winter. For the remainder of
the year, Greenland experienced above-average
winds. Notable small-magnitude negative wind
speed pat terns persisted over the Indian

subcontinent during spring and early summer.
In the Southern Hemisphere, there is evidence
of considerable wind speed anomalies of both
signs over Antarctica, possibly a result of varying
cyclolysis regions and katabatic wind regimes.
The austral spring over the tip of South America
also experienc  s tronger-than -normal wind
speeds.

TELECONNECTION PATTERNS AND BLOCKING
W. HIGGINS and M. L’HEUREUX

Teleconnection patterns are recurrent and persistent
large-scale patterns of pressure and circulation anomalies
that span large geographical areas. They reflect largescale changes in the atmospheric wave and jet stream
patterns, and influence temperature, rainfall, storm
tracks, and jet stream location and intensity over vast

distances. Thus, they are often responsible for abnormal
weather patterns occurring simultaneously over regions
separated by great distances. Although these patterns
typically last from several weeks to several months,
they can sometimes be prominent for consecutive years
or longer, reflecting an important part of both the
interannual and interdecadal variability of the atmospheric
circulation. The focus of this section is on the NAO,
PNA, and WP teleconnection patterns. Monthly index

values for the NAO, PNA, and WP teleconnection patterns
over the last few years are shown in Figure 2.23. The
NOAA/CPC provides daily and monthly time series for
other NH teleconnection patterns and details about the
analysis procedure used to obtain them (information
online at www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/data/teledoc/
telecontents.shtml).
Atmospheric blocking is charac terized by an
interruption or splitting of the normal westerly flow

around a ridge of high pressure into two separate
branches over a considerable longitudinal extent.
Common characteristics include easterly flow to the
south of the blocking ridge and pronounced
meridional flow both upstream and downstream of
the blocking ridge. As a consequence, the normal
eastward progression of synoptic disturbances is
obstructed, leading to episodes of prolonged extreme
weather conditions. On intraseasonal time scales
the persistent weather extremes can last from several
days up to a few weeks, often accompanied by
significant temperature and precipitation anomalies.
Preferred areas for atmospheric blocking, especially
during the NH cold season, include the North Pacific
and northeastern Atlantic.
NOAA/CPC routinely monitors atmospheric blocking
and is involved in continuing research to better
understand its role in the global climate system.
The procedure used to identify blocking is based on
the blocking index of Tibaldi and Molteni (1990),
modifi from that of Lejenas and Okland (1983).
The index calculation, together with current
conditions, blocking outlooks, and blocking composites,
is readily available from the CPC Web site (www.cpc.
ncep.noaa.gov/products/precip/CWlink/MJO/block.
shtml).

DESCRIPTION OF TELECONNECTION PATTERNS

The NAO is a metric of the meridional pressure gradient over the North Atlantic Ocean (see Hurrell 1995;
Barnston and Livezey 1987), and is highly correlated
with the AO (e.g., Wallace 2000; Thompson and Wallace
1998). The most conspicuous attribute of the PNA is
a “wave train” of action centres that stretch from the
subtropical North Pacific to Florida, with intermediate
action centres near the Aleutians and in central Canada
(see Wallace and Gutzler 1981). ENSO is related to a
PNA-like pattern in the extratropics. El Niño (La Niña)
tends to be associated with the positive (negative)
phase of the PNA pattern.
The West Pacific pattern consists of a north–south
dipole of anomalies, with one centre located over
the Kamchatka Peninsula and another broad centre
of the opposite sign covering portions of southeastern Asia and the western subtropical North
Pacific. A third anomaly centre is located over the
eastern North Pacific and southwestern United

23
StateoftheClimate_2006.indd 23

2/22/08 11:18:32 AM

States. Strong positive or negative phases of this
pattern reflect pronounced zonal and meridional
variations in the location and intensity of the entrance
region of the Pacific jet steam. The positive phase
is associated with above-average precipitation in
all seasons over the high latitudes of the North
Pacific, and below-average precipitation extending
across the central North Pacific toward the west
coast of North America; the opposite is true for the
negative phase.
2)

RECENT MONTHLY TELECONNECTION INDEX VALUES

For 2006 as a whole, both the NAO and PNA were
dominated by the negative phase, though there were
notable monthly excursions into the positive phase
(e.g., the PNA during July 2006). The WP pattern was
generally positive during early 2006, with strong
negative excursions during NH summer and during
November 2006. During February 2006, the 500-hPa
circulation pattern in the extratropics featured a
pronounced north–south dipole of height anomalies
across the western and central North Pacific, which
reflected a strong positive phase (+2.5) of the WP
teleconnection pattern (Figure 2.23b). The 500-hPa
circulation pattern during August–October 2006
featured positive height anomalies over Greenland
and the polar region, and negative height anomalies
2.5
2

from the north-central United States to the United
Kingdom; and over central Siberia. The eastern third
of the United States tended to be colder than normal,
especially in September and October, consistent with
the strong negative values of the NAO index
(Figure 2.23a). During October, the NAO index value
was –2.2, and for the August–October season, the
NAO index value was –1.9. The October 2006 value
(–2.2) was the most extreme since the October 2002
value (–2.3), when temperatures across the northern
and eastern United States were also signifi cantly
below normal.
The NH 2005/06 winter was dominated by the
negative phase of the NAO for the first time since
2000/01 (not shown). On the other hand, the PNA
continued in its positive polarity for the fourth
consecutive winter season (Figure 2.24). Since
1995, the PNA has tended to be in the positive
phase; 2006 was a bit of an exception in that the
PNA index was negative during six calendar
months.

DESCRIPTION OF BLOCKING EPISODES AND LINKS
TO MAJOR CLIMATE ANOMALIES DURING 2006

Two examples that relate exceptional blocking
events to extreme weather conditions during 2006
are presented below. The latter event was associated
with the negative polarity of the WP teleconnection
pattern.

Excessive rainfall in New England during May 2006

Record rainfall fell over portions of New England
(specifically northeastern Massachusetts, southern
New Hampshire, and southern Maine) during
12–15 May 2006, resulting in flooding in the region
comparable to the most extreme events during the
last 70 years. Rainfall totals at some locations exceeded
12 feet.

The procedure used to calculate the teleconnection patterns is
briefly described in the caption to Figure 2.23.

The blocking conditions developed in the beginning
of May 2006 when a block formed in the vicinity
of Scandinavia. As is quite of ten the case, the
blocking ridge shifted westward with time (retrograde motion) at high latitudes, passing over
Greenland (20°–50°W) during 6–12 May and over
eastern Canada (60°W– 90°) during 12–15 May
(Figure 2.25). The low-level (850 hPa) wind during

base period means. The blocking ridge axis is indicated by the
dotted white line, and the flanking trough axes are indicated

12–15 May (Figure 2.26a) shows a cyclonic circulation covering the entire eastern United States. The
persistent very strong southeasterly flow of moist
Atlantic air over central New England contributed
greatly to the excessive rainfall totals observed in
the region (Figure 2.26b). Situations like this one
often feature a “training” effect in which precipitating clouds move over the same area along the
direction of the mean flow, resulting in excessive
rainfall and flooding.

Pacific in early November (Figure 2.27). The northern
and southern branches of the Pacific jet stream recombined over the eastern North Pacific, contributing to
a series of strong storms that resulted in remarkably
wet and cold conditions in the Pacifi c Northwest,
western Canada, and portions of Alaska during the
first half of November 2006. This pattern projected
very strongly on the negative phase of the WP
teleconnection pattern during November 2006
(Figure 2.23b).
It is important to note that the conditions during
November 2006 were related to midlatitude variability,
with little or no connection to the developing El Niño
conditions in the tropical Pacific. In particular, these
events occurred in advance of the development of
El Niño–related enhanced convection near and to the
east of the international date line, which typically leads
to atmospheric coupling and an eastward shift of the
subtropical ridges and the North Pacific jet stream
during the NH winter.

OVERVIEW J. M. LEVY

80N
60N

As the global ocean observing system matures, climatologies of essential climate variables are growing
more robust, as are observations of anomalous departures that shed light on the evolving behavior of the
coupled ocean–atmosphere system. Year 2006 exhibited numerous anomalies of interest:
• Global SST anomalies were primarily positive, notably so in boreal summer in the North Atlantic
and in the latter part of the year in the central and
eastern equatorial Pacific, associated with the
2006 El Niño.
• The mean of latent plus sensible heat flux was similar to that in 2005; total flux in both years was at
the high end of a long-term upward trend that started in 1977/78. Significant heat flux anomalies were
observed in the regions of the 2006 El Niño and Indian Ocean dipole mode event.
• Global sea surface salinity anomalies accentuated
climatological patterns: freshwater regions were
fresher and salty regions were saltier. The subpolar
North Atlantic and Nordic Seas were anomalously
salty in 2006.
• Dramatic westward surface current anomalies
associated with the development of El Niño were
observed late in the year in the tropical Pacific Ocean,
while the seasonal reversal of currents was
particularly pronounced on the equator in the Atlantic
Ocean. Exchange of water between the South and
North Atlantic Oceans was weaker than normal.
• The MOC in the North Atlantic was a bit low,
albeit within a standard deviation of the historical
annual mean. However, there is no indication of a
systematic trend in MOC transport.
• Annual mean SLA was above the 1993–99 baseline
average for nearly 80% of the ocean. The global
mean SLA change of +6 mm from 2005 was the
highest increase since the altimeter record began
in 1993. Relative sea level change was also the highest ever recorded. There were an anomalously high
number of extreme sea level events.
• Global ocean carbon uptake in 2005 (about
2.2 Pg C yr–1) was near average for the past decade.
Interannual variability over the past decade has
been about ±0.2 Pg C yr–1. Atlantic Ocean anthropogenic CO2 uptake continues to exceed Pacific
Ocean uptake.
• Global annual average ocean colour anomalies
were not markedly different from those observed

However, anomalies in the Niño-3.4 region were
indicative of a 2006 El Niño that was stronger (considerably weaker) than that of 2002/03 (1997/98).

SSTs for 2006 are shown as monthly fields interpolated

All results presented here are depicted as anomalies
defined as differences from a 1971–2002 climatological
base period described by Xue et al. (2003).
The yearly average and standard deviation of the monthly
anomalies are shown in Figure 3.1. The anomalies are

27
StateoftheClimate_2006.indd 27

primarily positive resulting from overall global warming
relative to the climatological base period. Three features
dominate 2006. First, the average shows a strong positive anomaly signal in the North Atlantic and North
Pacific between roughly 40° and 65°N. This is due to a
boreal summer positive anomaly, which also occurred
in 2003–06. However, in 2006, the summer anomaly in
the Pacific was relatively weak compared with 2003–05.
Second, in 2005 there was also a strong positive anomaly
of roughly 1°C in the tropical North Atlantic (0°–30°N)
while in 2006 it was smaller. Finally, a weak El Niño
began to be evident in June (see section 4).
The zonally averaged monthly anomaly is shown for
the Atlantic between 80°W and 20°E for 2000–06 in
Figure 3.2. Strong positive summer anomalies are
shown north of 40°N beginning in 2003. The anomaly
signals were the oceanic response to summer heat

waves that helped reduce summer ice cover in the
Arctic. The 2003 European summer heat wave corresponded to an especially strong positive SST anomaly.
In addition, the 2005 spring and summer tropical North
Atlantic positive anomalies are evident between 5° and
20°N in the figure and were smaller in 2006. The smaller
anomalies in 2006 may partly explain the lower number
of 2006 Atlantic hurricanes compared to 2005.

HEAT CONTENT G. C. JOHNSON, J. M. LYMAN, and
J. K. WILLIS

Storage and transport of heat in the ocean are central
to such aspects of climate as El Niño (e.g., Zebiak 1989),
the North Atlantic Oscillation (e.g., Curry and McCartney
2001), hurricane seasons (e.g., Emanuel 2005), and
global change (e.g., Levitus et al. 2005; Hansen et al.
2005). Here we discuss an estimate of upper (0–750 m)
OHCA estimated from a combination of in situ temperature profiles with satellite altimetry sea surface
height data for the period of 1 January–31 December
2006 (Figure 3.3), analysed following Willis et al. (2004),
but relative to a 1993–2006 baseline. Data from Argo
floats with a recently detected systematic bias in
reported pressure values have been removed from the
estimates discussed here. Details of the fields analysed
here may change after more real-time data are subject
to delayed-mode scientific quality control.
The 2006 combined OHCA map (Figure 3.3) shows eddy
and meander variability down to the 100-km mapping
scales, as does, to a greater extent, the difference between
the 2006 and 2005 combined OHCA maps (Figure 3.4).
There is a great deal of small-scale spatial variability in
OHCA fields associated with the western boundary currents in every gyre, as well as the Antarctic Circumpolar
Current. The difference in combined OHCA maps between
2006 and 2005 (Figure 3.4) illustrates the large year-toyear variability in ocean heat storage, with changes
reaching or exceeding the equivalent of an 80 W m–2
magnitude surface flux. Ocean advection likely plays a
significant role in many of these changes.

Figure 3.2. Zonally averaged monthly SST anomalies for
January 2000 through December 2006 for the Atlantic. The
contour interval is 0.3°C; the zero contour is not shown. The
anomalies are computed relative to a 1971–2000 base period.

Large-scale patterns are also evident in OHCA for 2006
(Figure 3.3), and for its difference from 2005 (Figure 3.4).
One of the prominent patterns is along the equatorial
Pacific, where there is a band of high heat content in
2006, which is also seen as a heat gain since 2005. This
pattern is consistent with the onset of El Niño in 2006.
There is also a band of high OHCA along 10°N from the

28

western Pacific to about 160°W. In addition, there is a
band of high OHCA that reaches from 150°E on the
equator to at least 120°W and about 25°S.
The combined OHCA map for 2006 (Figure 3.3) is high
in the subpolar North Atlantic (except for seas just
northeast of Iceland) and low in the subtropical North
Atlantic. This pattern dynamically implies a decreased
strength of the North Atlantic Current, and is probably
related to decadal changes in the North Atlantic
Oscillation Index (e.g., Curry and McCartney 2001).
This climate index was lower in 2006 than during the
baseline period; it has trended lower from 1993 to
2006.
In the equatorial Indian Ocean, OCHA is low in the
east and high in the west (Figure 3.3), with interannual
variations (Figure 3.4) apparently contributing to this
pattern. The southern subtropics of the Indian Ocean
are generally high in OCHA, but changes since 2005
(Figure 3.4) do appear to be a dominant contributor
to this pattern.
In 2006, OHCA is high in the Southern Oceans in a
belt located north of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current
(Figure 3.3), especially east of New Zealand in the
South Pacific and between 30° and 45°S in the South
Atlantic, but less perceptible in the south Indian Ocean.
This change has recently been studied on decadal
time scales in the South Pacific (Roemmich et al. 2007)
and appears to be related to changes in the wind stress
field associated with an increase in the Antarctic
Oscillation index. This index reached a peak in 1999,

fell into a shallow valley in 2002, and has been near
neutral since then. Consistent with this neutrality,
there is relatively little large-scale trend of OHCA
between 2005 and 2006 in this region (Figure 3.4),
with smaller spatial scale changes of varying sign
predominating in the subpolar regions of the Southern
Hemisphere.
Finally, given the potential link between hurricane
intensity and warm ocean waters (e.g., Emanuel 2005),
we discuss tropical Atlantic patterns in OHCA. There
was a record North Atlantic hurricane season in 2005
and a much weaker one in 2006 (see section 4). This
change is consistent with decreases in OHCA from
2005 to 2006 in the Gulf of Mexico, in the Caribbean,
and to a lesser extent around 10°N across much of
the tropical North Atlantic (Figure 3.4). This area had
an increase in OHCA and hurricanes between 2004
and 2005 (Shein et al. 2006).

GLOBAL OCEAN HEAT FLUXES L. YU and R. A. WELLER

Latent heat (evaporation) and sensible heat fluxes are
the primary mechanism by which the oceans release
much of the absorbed solar energy back to the atmosphere. These ocean-to-atmosphere heat transfers
are a cooling mechanism for the oceans but a source
of heating for the atmosphere. The cooling and heating change the temperature gradients and energize
the circulations in the ocean and atmosphere, which
in turn affect air–sea temperature and humidity contrasts and modify the magnitudes of the ocean heat
fluxes.

The estimates for the global LHF + SHF in 2006
(Figure 3.5) were produced by the OAFlux project (Yu
and Weller 2007) at the WHOI. The flux estimates are
accurate within 8 W m–2. On an annual mean basis, the
largest absolute ocean heat losses occur over the regions
associated with major WBCs and their extensions, the
most noted of which are the Kuroshio off Japan, the
Gulf Stream off the United States, and the Agulhas
Current off the African coast. The magnitude of annual
mean LHF + SHF in these regions exceeds 250 W m–2,
and is produced largely during the fall-to-winter seasons
by strong winds and cold and dry air masses coming
from the land. The secondary heat loss maximum (~180
W m–2) is located over the broad subtropical southern
Indian Ocean, where the large air–sea heat exchanges
are sustained by the strong southeast trade winds durin g t h e b o r e a l s umm e r m o n s o o n m o n t h s

in 2006. The sign is defined as upward (downward) positive
(negative). (bottom) Differences between the 2006 and 2005
annual mean latent plus sensible heat fluxes.

Compared to the annual mean LHF + SHF in 2005
(Figure 3.5), the heat fluxes in 2006 showed changes
over all global basins, with the magnitude of the
deviation within 50 W m –2. Among all of the changes,
two features in the tropical oceans are the most
interesting. The first change is the increased LHF +
SHF in the eastern and central equatorial Pacific Ocean
concurrent with the development of a mild El Niño.
In late 2006, SSTs were 2°–3°C above normal across
much of the region. The increased evaporative heat
loss is observed in regions of the El Niño warm SST
anomalies. Variation of ocean heat fluxes in the tropical
Pacific on ENSO time scales is a dominant interannual
signal in the OAFlux multidecade time series (e.g.,
Yu and Weller 2007). The second feature is characterized
by the east–west asymmetry in the 2005/06 difference
anomalies in the tropical Indian Ocean. A positive
IOD mode event occurred in 2006, with cold SST
anomalies off the west coasts of Sumatra and Java
and warm SST anomalies across the central and
western parts of the basin. The IOD SST pattern is
almost a mirror image of the El Niño SST in the Pacific.
However, the changes in the flux patterns of these
two basins did not mirror each other in 2006. The
colder eastern Indian Ocean enhanced sea-to-air heat
fluxes, while the warmer western Indian Ocean reduced
the heat fluxes. This means that positive SST anomalies
in the El Niño region correlated with positive heat
flux anomalies, but positive SST anomalies in the
Indian Ocean correlated with negative heat flux
anomalies. The sign of the flux changes was opposite
to the sign of the SST anomalies in the two basins,
which suggested different feedback mechanisms
were at work. Scientists are working to determine if
the SST–flux relationship in the Pacific suggests a
response of the atmosphere to the oceanic forcing,
and if the SST–flux relationship in the Indian Ocean
implies an atmospheric forcing for the ocean.
Outside of the Tropics, the influence of eddy-scale
structures is evident in the 2-yr difference map.
Nevertheless, the difference anomalies are most pronounced in the vicinity of the two WBCs, that is, the
Kuroshio and the Gulf Stream, and their extensions.
For the former, there were negative LHF + SHF anomalies
over almost the entire region; while for the latter, there
were negative flux anomalies south of the Gulf Stream
extension and positive anomalies north of the current.
A colder sea surface coupled to slightly weakened wind
speed appears to be the cause of the reduced LHF +

30
StateoftheClimate_2006.indd 30

2/22/08 11:18:41 AM

SHF in these regions. It may be worth noting that the
SSTs in the Kuroshio and its extension are generally
lower than normal during the ENSO warm phases (White
and He 1986). The connection between lower SST and
less oceanic heat loss is another indication of the
response of the atmosphere to oceanic forcing.
The long-term context of the change in ocean heat
fluxes in 2006 is shown in the plot of year-to-year
variations of the globally averaged annual mean from
1958 to 2006 (Figure 3.6). The 2006 mean of LHF +
SHF was at a similar level to the 2005 mean. However,
the two recent years are located at the high end of
a long-term upward trend that started in 1977/78.
Since then, LHF + SHF have increased by about
9 W m –2, from a minimum at ~99 W m –2 in 1977 to a
maximum at ~108 W m –2 in 2003. The magnitude of
the variability is dominated primarily by LHF. SHF is
about one order smaller than LHF, and the change
in SHF is also small (less than 2 W m –2 over the entire
50-year analysis period). Nonetheless, the trend in
SHF is very different from that in LHF: the downward
trend in SHF lasted until the late 1980s, followed by
a few abrupt jumps in the early 1990s. Since 2000,
SHF has tended downward.

al. 2006), and global climate change (e.g., Held and
Soden 2006). Regional studies of decadal freshwater
variability are possible in well-sampled regions like the
North Atlantic (e.g., Curry and Mauritzen 2005). In
addition, zonal averages of long-term global trends of
salinity in each ocean basin have been analysed (Boyer
et al. 2005). In situ ocean salinity data have traditionally
been too sparse and their reporting too delayed for an
annual global perspective of ocean freshwater and its
complement, salinity. However, the rapidly maturing
Argo array of profiling floats (Roemmich et al. 2004)
is remedying this situation. Argo data are used here
to present annual average SSS analyses for 2006 and
2005, the first years with near-global Argo coverage.
Remote sensing of SSS by satellite is planned for 2009
(information online at http://aquarius.nasa.gov/ ).
Here the shallowest near-surface (< 25 m) salinity
data flagged as good from each available Argo profile
for the years in question were subjected to a statistical check to discard outliers. The remaining data
were then cast as differences from a climatological
mean surface salinity field from the WOA based on
historical data reported through 2001 (WOA 2001;
Boyer et al. 2002). The resulting anomalies were then
mapped, essentially assuming a Gaussian covariance
function with 6° latitude and longitude decorrelation
length scales and a signal-to-noise variance ratio of
2.2 (Bretherton et al. 1976).1
SSS patterns are fairly well correlated with surface
freshwater flux, the sum of evaporation, precipitation,
and river runoff (e.g., Behringer et al. 1998). In each
ocean basin, subtropical salinity maxima centred near
20° or 25° in latitude are signatures of the predominance of evaporation over precipitation. Conversely,
in most regions where climatological surface salinities
are relatively fresh, precipitation generally dominates
over evaporation. The 2006 anomalies from WOA 2001
(Figure 3.7) reveal some large-scale patterns. In 2006
the regions around the climatological salinity maxima
are mostly salty with respect to WOA 2001. In many
of the climatologically fresh regions, 2006 values
appear fresher than those of WOA 2001, including
most of the ACC near 50°S, the subpolar gyre of the

(red), and sensible heat flux (blue)

While some delayed-mode scientific controlled (final) Argo data are available for
the 2005–06 time period, many real-time (preliminary) Argo data were used in
both years. The real-time estimates of SSS made here could change after all the
data have been subject to careful scientific quality control.

North Pacific, and the ITCZ over the Atlantic and Pacific
Oceans (including the SPCZ).
These patterns may suggest an increase in the hydrological cycle (more evaporation in drier locations, and
more precipitation in rainy areas), as depicted in
simulations of global warming. These simulations do
suggest that this signal might be discernible during
the last two decades of the twentieth century (Held
and Soden 2006). Any increase in the hydrological
cycle would certainly result in changes of local SSS
values, but not alter the global average salinity by
itself. Most of these patterns observed in 2006
(Figure 3.7) are not reflected in the 2005–06 differences
(Figure 3.8), suggesting that these anomalies have
evolved over longer-than-interannual time scales;
although, without global coverage prior to 2005, it is
difficult to determine the time scale. However, there
are alternate explanations. It is possible that the climatology, being based on relatively sparse data distributions in many parts of the oceans, may tend to
underestimate regional extrema that the well-sampled
Argo array can better resolve. Also, some of these
patterns might be explained by interannual shifts in
ocean features such as the ACC or atmospheric features such as the ITCZ.

the hydrological cycle. However, the pattern may have
less to do with local evaporation and precipitation
fields and more with northward spread of saltier waters
from the south. The salty anomaly in this region is
consistent with a stronger influence of subtropical
gyre waters in the northeastern North Atlantic in recent
years and a reduced extent for the subpolar gyre
(Hátún et al. 2005).
There are evidently some rather large anomalies in
the equatorial and North Indian Ocean. The Bay of
Bengal and much of the Arabian Sea appear to be
anomalously salty, while the ocean to the south and
east of India appears to be fresh (Figure 3.7). The
changes appear to be interannual, as reflected in the
large changes in anomaly between 2005 and 2006 in
this region (Figure 3.8).
One last feature of interest in the 2006 salinity field
is the anomalously salty water located in the region
of the fresh Amazon River plume (Figure 3.7). The
influence of this plume would normally be apparent
in the relatively fresh conditions to the north and
west of the mouth of the Amazon River (near the
equator) that reach as far north as Puerto Rico. The
salty anomaly in this region in 2006 may be explained
by the reduced freshwater flow from the Amazon
into the ocean during a record drought in the Amazon
River basin in 2005 (Shein et al. 2006), with some
time delay for hydrological and oceanic processes.
The change in salinity between 2005 and 2006
(Figure 3.8) shows that this salty anomaly is limited
to 2006.

SURFACE CURRENT OBSERVATIONS R. LUMPKIN
and G. GONI

Near-surface currents are measured in situ by satellitetracked drifting buoys and acoustic point-measuring
meters on ATLAS moorings.2 In September 2005, the
drifter array reached its target goal of 1250 drifters
worldwide, becoming the first fully realized component
of the GCOS-92. During 2006, surface currents were
well sampled except in the far northern Pacific, in the
southwest Pacific between 20 ° and 40°S, from 150°E
to the date line, for the Arabian Basin of the
Indian Ocean, and for the extreme Southern Ocean
south of 55°S.
Weekly maps of absolute surface currents and geostrophic current anomalies for 2006 were calculated
from a synthesis of in situ observations, near-real-time
AVISO data gridded altimetry, and NCEP operational
winds (Niiler et al. 2003). Anomalies are defined with
respect to the 1993–98 mean.
In 2006, the most dramatic surface current anomalies
were associated with the development of El Niño
conditions late in the year in the Pacific Ocean basin.
Anomalies elsewhere in the World Ocean were caused
either by energetic mesoscale (60–90-day period)
variations or by displacements of currents from their
typical positions, or were associated with the seasonal
reversals of currents in the Tropics.

(i) Pacific Ocean
Annual mean anomalies (Figure 3.9) were most prominently organized in a coherent pattern in the western
tropical Pacific Ocean, associated with the 2006
El Niño. Seasonal mean anomalies (Figure 3.10) show
a typical seasonal reversal of the equatorial surface
current from January through June. During July, eastward anomalies began developing in the eastern
(145°–170°E) equatorial Pacific (Figure 3.11). By August,
these anomalies had reached 70 cm s –1 at 160°E to the
date line. In September, eastward anomalies of
~40 cm s –1 were seen at 120°–140°W. The largest eastward anomalies of 50 cm s –1 were seen in October at
160°E to the date line. These anomalies also propagated
eastward while weakening to +25 cm s –1 in November.
Anomalies in December were small.
(ii)

Indian Ocean

The tropical Indian basin exhibited a band of anomalously eastward flow along 25°–30°S, immediately
south of westward anomalies. This is the band where
the westward SEC encounters Madagascar and is
deflected southwestward to join the Agulhas Current
system flowing southward against Africa’s west
coast. The anomaly pattern suggests that the SEC
was displaced to the north of its climatological position. Seasonally averaged anomalies (not shown)
were associated with monsoon-driven changes in
the tropical basin and the complex pattern of mesoscale anomalies in the Agulhas Return Current. The
eastward equatorial jet was prominent in April–June,
but not in October–December.
(iii)

Atlantic Ocean

The seasonal reversal of western tropical Atlantic
Ocean currents (cf. Lumpkin and Garzoli 2005) was
prominent in 2006. Anomalously strong westward
anomalies were seen on the equator in July–September,

reversing to eastward anomalies in October–December.
This reversal is typical, but was more energetic and
dramatic in 2006. Anomalies elsewhere were associated with intense mesoscale features in the Gulf
Stream, Brazil/Falkland Islands (Malvinas) Confluence
off the Brazilian coast, and the Agulhas retroflection
west of the southern tip of Africa. Averaged over 2006,
the Gulf Stream axis was close to its climatological
position. Late in 2006, the Gulf Stream developed a
dramatic pat tern of alternating meanders at
50 °–65°W.
Satellite altimetry observations indicate that the Agulhas
Current, which runs southward against Africa’s southeast
coast, was somewhat larger than average during 2006.
This current can serve to connect the Indian and Atlantic
Oceans by transferring salty, tropical Indian water into
the South Atlantic via Agulhas rings shed from the current. However, the number of rings shed in 2006, as
revealed by altimetry, was lower than average. Thus,
unless the few rings that were shed were unusually
deep, the South Atlantic Ocean may reveal fresh anomalies in Argo-derived salinity maps for early 2007.
The NBC runs northward along the Brazilian coast,
carrying South Atlantic water past the equator before
it abruptly leaves the coast and flows eastward across
the Atlantic. Rings shed by the NBC continue northwestward, and carry a large fraction of the upper-water
exchange from the South Atlantic to the North Atlantic.
This pathway is thus a critical part of the upper limb
of the MOC in the Atlantic.
The space–time diagram of sea height residual (sea
height anomaly with the annual cycle removed) along

the pathway of NBC rings (not shown) reveals that
five rings are shed by the NBC during 2006, which is
approximately the historical mean. However, most of
these rings did not enter the Caribbean Sea.
The time series of geostrophic transport of the Yucatan
Straits (not shown), connecting the Caribbean Sea to
the Gulf of Mexico, indicates that the transport
decreased during 2006. This is significant, because
the flow through the Yucatan Straits feeds the Loop
Current– Florida Current– Gulf Stream system.
Consistently, the Florida Current transport, measured
by an undersea cable running from South Florida to
the Bahamas, decreased slightly from its historical
average of 30–32 million tons s –1 in mid-October to
around 28 million tons s –1 by the end of the year. Such
anomalies are common in the record.

THE MERIDIONAL OVERTURNING CIRCULATION AND
OCEANIC HEAT TRANSPORT M. O. BARINGER and
C. S. MEINEN

The component of the ocean circulation associated
most with long-time-scale variability in heat redistribution is the MOC, sometimes referred to as the
“thermohaline circulation.” The MOC is a global circulation cell wherein surface waters in the high latitudes are cooled, thereby becoming denser; this dense
water sinks and flows toward the equatorial regions.
In tropical and subtropical regions around the world
these waters eventually mix with other waters, becoming less dense, and they return to the sea surface to
ultimately flow toward the higher latitudes and complete the cell. This circulation simultaneously transfers
a significant amount of heat to the higher latitudes.

shows no corresponding long-term trend through 2006
(Figure 3.12). The annual mean transport observed in
2006 (31.3 Sv3) falls within the lowest quartile of historical annual mean transports from the cable, however
this transport is still well within one standard deviation
from the long-term mean of 32.1 Sv. Given the statistical standard error of the mean of 1 Sv for the year,
2006 cannot be termed as an unusual year in terms of
the Florida Current transport. Additional information
can be found in Baringer and Meinen (2006).

The strengths of the overturning circulations in different basins are directly related to the strength of
the heat transport; warm water flowing north in the
upper layers and returning southward as cold water
at depth represents a net poleward heat transport in
the Northern Hemisphere. There are several available
estimates of the averaged global mass and heat
transport based on inverse model calculations
(Lumpkin and Speer 2007; Ganachaud and Wunsch
2003; Talley 2003;). Historical estimates of the state
of the MOC have come from either cross-basin hydrographic sections or specific point measurements of
the water property changes in the deep ocean. These
water property measurements have been used to
infer the state of the MOC using a variety of analytical
techniques. Currently, observing systems capable of
quantifying changes in the complete MOC are at
fledgling stages that at best observe only one component (e.g., a specific current or ocean layer) of the
MOC at discrete locations.
The MOC is generally thought of as a basin-wide phenomenon, however at 26°N in the Atlantic the bulk of
the warm upper limb of the MOC is thought to be carried in the Florida Current through the Straits of Florida
(with a smaller contribution being carried by the Antilles
Current east of the Bahamas), while the majority of
the cold lower limb is believe to be carried to the south
in the DWBC just east of the Bahamas. Fluctuations
in the Florida Current show a clear negative correlation
with the atmospheric phenomenon known as the NAO;
however, while the NAO has been tending to decrease
over the past 20 years, the Florida Current transport

In a recent article, Bryden et al. (2005) postulate a
30% reduction in the MOC transport between the
1950s and the present day. However, that analysis is
based on a very limited dataset (essentially five
“snapshot” hydrographic sections). In contrast, a
comparison of moored observations near the Southeast
Newfoundland Ridge in the early 1990s and early
2000s finds no trend in the DWBC transport (Schott
et al. 2004), and a subsequent study at 26°N comparing transports from moored instruments in the late
1980s and 2004/05 finds no indication of a systematic
trend either (Meinen et al. 2006). Furthermore, the
latter study finds evidence of significant baroclinic
and barotropic variability at time scales that could
be aliased by “snapshot” hydrographic sections such
as those used in Bryden et al. (2005).
Other recent work using cross-basin hydrographic
sections along 48°N in the Atlantic suggest conflicting
conclusions relative to the state of the thermohaline
circulation. In particular, Koltermann et al. (1999)
show large variability of the MOC that, they conclude,
is related to the strength of Labrador Sea Water
production, with larger (smaller) MOC transport

corresponding to less (more) Labrador Sea Water
expor t. More recently, these data have been
reanalyzed to formally test the hypothesis that the
MOC circulation is steady. Lumpkin et al. (2007) find
that a steady MOC over the same time period could
not be ruled out based on the uncer taint y in
determining the barotropic circulation.
Clearly, additional work needs to be done to understand the full range of time scales associated with
MOC variability and the improvement of error estimates attached to these estimates. The programs in
place in 2006 are an excellent first step toward the
development of an integrated measurement system.
However, much work remains to fully monitor the
Atlantic MOC system, as well as the global overturning circulation system.

SEA LEVEL M. A. MERRIFIELD, S. GILL, G. T. MITCHUM,
and P. L. WOODWORTH

Global sea level variability during 2006 is summarized
using measurements from the complementary satellite altimeter and tide gauge observing systems. Here
we use SLA data (1993–99 base) from the multimission, 1/4° gridded product available from the French
Aviso program (online at www.aviso.ceanobs.com/ ).
Because 2006 satellite orbit corrections are still being
applied, the 2006 SLA analysis period is taken as
October 2005 through September 2006. We also used
RSL data (1993–99 base) from The GLOSS (Woodworth
et al. 2003), a network of nearly 300 coastal tide
gauges. The SLA is used to assess global mean sea
level change and RSL is used to summarize coastal
sea level variability for 2006.4
Annual mean SLA in 2006 was above the 1993–99
baseline average for nearly 80% of the ocean surface
(Figure 3.13). Bands of high SLA (10–20 cm) occurred
in the western tropical Pacific east of the Philippines,
extending southeastward from the Solomon Islands
along the South Pacifi c convergence zone. These

The altimeter products were produced by Ssalto/Duacs and distributed by Aviso,
with support from CNES (www.aviso.oceanobs.com). The Aviso dataset used is
listed as the Gridded Sea Level Anomalies DT-MSLA “Ref,” multimission product.
Tide gauge data were obtained from the University of Hawaii Sea Level Center
(http://uhslc.soest.hawaii.edu). SLA is corrected for atmospheric pressure, the RSL
time series is not.

bands also were the areas of the highest positive
increase relative to the 2005 annual mean. A notable
pattern in the eastern equatorial Pacific that was most
evident after the averaging period used to construct
Figure 3.13 was a weak El Niño event with ~10 cm
positive sea level anomalies in December 2006.
The spatially weighted, global mean SLA for 2006 was
the highest annual mean (computed from October
through September of each year) since the beginning
of the altimeter record in 1993. Global mean SLA was
6 mm higher in 2006 than 2005, an increase larger than
the global sea level rise rate of 2.8 ± 0.4 mm yr–1 estimated over altimeter data from 1993 to 2003 (Leuliette
et al. 2004). The increasing global mean level is attributed primarily to large SLA increases south of 20°N,
especially between 40° and 30°S and near the equator
(Figure 3.14a), and in longitude bands encompassing
the Indo-Pacific (100°–240°E) and the Atlantic (310°E–
360°) (Figure 3.14b). Detailed global maps of SLA trends
are available online at http://sealevel.colorado.edu/.
Changes in relative sea level, including vertical land
motion contributions, are examined using available
RSL data from 2006 (Figure 3.15). This provides an
assessment of sea level change as experienced at
the coast, but is not a measure of global mean sea
level change, which is best addressed using the SLA
dataset. The annual RSL average for 2006 was the
highest over the collective record, which begins in
at least 1980 for the majority of stations, and in the
early twentieth century for ~10% of stations. The station mean RSL increased by 2.9 mm in 2006 from

is 2.3 mm yr–1 since 1993, the time span of the SLA
data, and 1.9 mm yr–1 since 1975.
Extreme sea levels during 2006, associated with
storms and other nontidal variability, is characterized
by the average of the 5% largest daily averaged RSL
values at each station. The highest extreme values
occurred at high-latitude stations resulting from
winter storms, with sporadic high values at low-latitude stations presumably resulting from isolated
storm events (Figure 3.15a). To determine how anomalous the extremes were during 2006, the percentage
of years at each station with extreme values less than
2006 is depicted in Figure 3.15b. For the majority of
stations, the 2006 extremes were in the 90th percentile
or higher (e.g., Europe, the east coast of North America,
the South Pacific). The year 2006 was an anomalously
high year for extreme sea levels in part because of
rising sea levels. If the percentiles are computed after
removing mean sea level trends at each station, 2006

is seen as a less anomalous year in the South Pacific,
although values around North America and North
Europe remain high (Figure 3.15c). The increase in
the 2006 percentiles for some Alaskan and Canadian
stations (Figure 3.15c) is due to the correction for
negative rates of RSL change.

atmospheric pCO2, together with wind speed. The
climatological monthly distribution of pCO2 in global
surface water has been calculated with a spatial resolution of 4° × 5° (Takahashi et al. 2002). Fewer than
30% of the monthly pixels have direct observations.
In general, the tropical regions are a net source of CO2
to the atmosphere and the high latitudes are a net sink
for CO2 (Figure 3.16). The published value for the net
air–sea flux indicates a net ocean uptake of 2.2 Pg C
for the reference year of 1995, but this estimate was
later corrected for a systematic error in the wind speeds
to give a net global ocean uptake of 1.5 Pg C for the
reference year of 1995 (Sabine et al. 2004a). The contemporary CO2 uptake of 1.5 Pg C yr–1 combined with
the estimated preindustrial ocean source of 0.6 Pg C yr–1
implies an anthropogenic CO2 uptake estimate (1.5 +
0.6 = 2.1 Pg C yr –1) that is consistent with other
independent estimates (Sabine et al. 2004a).
The CO2 climatology has been used extensively as a
baseline for placing regional flux estimates into a
global context and as a constraint for global biogeochemistry and inverse models. However, developing
seasonal-to-annual estimates of net air–sea CO2 fluxes
to evaluate the changing role of the ocean in the
global carbon cycle resulting from climate change
remains a formidable task. The large spatial and
temporal variability in surface water pCO2 still requires
interpolation approaches to determine a meaningful
global flux estimate or “flux map.” Making flux maps
directly from observations representing shorter time
frames, however, will require a continued expansion
of the observing network.
As a first step for assessing the interannual variability
in air–sea CO2 fluxes, we have taken the empirical

sea CO2 gas exchange from 1995 to 2005 relative to the 10-yr
mean. Negative values indicate increased ocean uptake.

approach of Lee et al. (1998) and Park et al. (2006) together
with global monthly estimates of SST and a high-resolution wind speed assimilation product (online at http://
podaac-www.jpl.nasa.gov/products/product079.html)
to develop monthly estimates of global air–sea CO2 flux
between 1995 and 2005. To execute the scheme, surface
water pCO2–SST relationships were determined for each
4° × 5° pixel from least squares linear fits of the monthly
climatological pCO2 (Takahashi et al. 2002) and SST
values for the following three periods: January–April,
May–August, and September–December. In much of
the world’s ocean, except in the South Indian and
Southern Oceans, the correlations between pCO2 and
SST are quite robust (r2 = 0.70 ± 0.3, number of pixels =
1314). These relationships are then applied to the interannual SST anomalies relative to 1995 to evaluate the
change in pCO2 for each pixel relative to the pCO2 climatology. For the equatorial Pacific Ocean, one of the
best-studied regions for seasonal and interannual CO2
flux variability (e.g., Chavez et al. 1999; Cosca et al. 2003;
Feely et al. 1995, 2006), empirical relationships between
surface water pCO2 and SST, rather than climatological
values, are used to estimate pCO2. Here we use the formulations of Cosca et al. (2003) to estimate pCO2 for the
equatorial Pacific between 5°N and 5°S. The air–sea flux
is then calculated for each 4° × 5° pixel using the derived
surface water pCO2 estimates; the global atmospheric
CO2 mole fraction obtained from NOAA’s Environmental
Science and Research Laboratory (GLOBALVIEW-CO2
2006), converted to pCO2 using the climatological SLP;
and the wind speed gas exchange parameterization of
Wanninkhof (1992). Validation of the approach at the
few time series sites available shows good correspondence in the sign of the year-to-year changes between
observations and this empirical approach, and an
agreement in magnitude of better than 40%.

Figure 3.17 shows the interannual variability in the net
annual air–sea CO2 gas exchange from 1995 to 2005 relative to the 10-yr mean. The period from 1995 to 1998 was
a period of generally negative anomalies indicating increased
uptake by the oceans. The effect of the 1997/98 El Niño
with decreased outgassing in the equatorial Pacific, which
translates into net increased oceanic uptake, is clearly
apparent (Feely et al. 2006). This is followed by three years
of reduced uptake. The 2005 uptake appears to be very
close to that of the 10-yr average. Overall, the implied
interannual variability of the ocean uptake is about 10% of
the climatological value, consistent with previous ocean
model–based estimates, including Park et al. (2006).
There are significant uncertainties in the seasonal flux
map calculations based on several factors, including
the assumptions that go into the fits, the quality of
the empirical fits, uncertainties in the reanalysis products, and uncertainties in the wind speed relationship
for gas exchange. This approach does not fully account
for the biological effects on surface water pCO2. Despite
these shortcomings, these first estimates of interannual variability provide a useful tool for assessing the
changing role of the ocean in global climate change
and for comparison with models. Extension of the
global surface ocean CO2 network will facilitate the
development of improved regional algorithms that
will lead to more accurate flux maps.

SUBSURFACE CARBON INVENTORY

An analysis of approximately 73,000 carbon measurements from 95 research cruises run as part of the WOCE
and the JGOFS in the 1990s has provided the first global
assessment of DIC distributions with sufficient accuracy
and coverage to evaluate the change in ocean carbon
resulting from the accumulation of anthropogenic CO2
(Feely et al. 2001; Wallace 2001). Using these measurements, Sabine et al. (2004b) estimated that the ocean
accumulated approximately 118 Pg C between 1800
and 1994 accounting for 48% of the CO2 released from
burning fossil fuels over this same time period
(Figure 3.18). The highest column inventories are
observed in the North Atlantic and in a band around
the Southern Hemisphere because these are regions
where surface waters are sinking and moving anthropogenic CO2 into the ocean interior (Figure 3.18).
Although the WOCE/JGOFS data were used to determine the total accumulation of carbon in the ocean

since preindustrial times, this one time global survey
could not provide information on how ocean carbon
inventories have evolved over time or how the storage
has varied geographically over different time periods.
To elucidate decadal variability and temporal evolution,
the US CLIVAR/CO2 Repeat Hydrography Program has
identified 19 hydrographic sections distributed around
the global ocean that will be reoccupied approximately
every 10 years. The programme started in 2003 with
three cruises in the North Atlantic that were repeats
of select WOCE/JGOFS cruises. Each year, one to three
cruises are run in different locations with a goal of
completing the first global resurvey by 2012.
The repeat hydrography strategy presents at least two
major challenges for interpreting the measurements.
First, it will take about a decade to survey enough of
the oceans to draw robust inferences about the global
patterns of decadal variations in the oceanic anthropogenic CO2 sink. Second, some of the assumptions
(e.g., steady-state circulation and biology) that appeared
to be reasonable for the Sabine et al. (2004b) 200-year
inventory assessment do not hold true for shorter time
scales. New techniques must be developed for isolating the anthropogenic signal from the natural variations
in ocean circulation and biological particle decomposition rates that affect the interior carbon distributions
on interannual-to-decadal time scales. Indeed, natural
ocean variations can be the same order of magnitude
as the anthropogenic changes and can either mask or
enhance the anthropogenic signal.
Ocean carbon changes have been evaluated for ocean
cruises that have reoccupied a Pacific north–south
section along 152°W from Antarctica to Alaska in 2005
and 2006, approximately 15 years after the WOCE/JGOFS

A full global assessment of ocean DIC changes cannot
be made until the resurvey of the oceans is completed
in the next few years. However, each updated ocean
section provides incremental insight into how carbon
uptake rates are evolving spatially and temporally.
Table 3.1, updated in this report to reflect the 2005/06
Pacific cruises, summarizes the current best estimates
of anthropogenic CO2 accumulation along representative north–south cruise tracks in the Atlantic and Pacific
Oceans. The North Atlantic shows the largest increase,
consistent with the long-term accumulation of Sabine
et al. (2004b), illustrating the importance of North
Atlantic Deep Water formation as a mechanism for
transporting anthropogenic CO2 into the ocean interior.
The formation of mode and intermediate waters in the
Southern Hemisphere also contributes to the substantial
DIC increases in the South Atlantic and South Pacific.
The North Pacific shows a relatively modest increase
because of the lack of deep water formation and
restricted intermediate water formation in that region.
The Indian Ocean is being surveyed in 2007/08, so
accumulation rates are not yet available.

cruises. The total DIC column inventory changes along
the section ranged from less than 2 mol C m–2 in the
high-latitude Southern Ocean to greater than
14 mol C m–2 in the North Pacific (Figure 3.19). This total
DIC change, however, reflects both the uptake of anthropogenic CO2 from the atmosphere and carbon changes
resulting from natural variations in ocean physics and
biogeochemistry. Separating these two components
using newly developed methodologies reveals that in
the North Pacific, the natural variations account for up
to 83% of the total DIC change, leaving a rather modest
anthropogenic CO2 component (Figure 3.19).

(e.g., Bopp et al. 2002; McNeil et al. 2003; Matsumoto
et al. 2004). If this carbon were distributed evenly over
the entire global ocean area (335.2 × 109 km2), it would
imply an average column inventory increase of
~0.55 mol C m–2 yr–1. The cruises completed thus far in
the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans tend to bracket this
average and suggest that the current patterns of ocean
carbon storage are similar to the patterns observed in
the long-term accumulation (Figure 3.18). As additional
cruises in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans are evaluated,
improved uptake estimates that consider the spatial
variability within a basin will be generated.

To place these regional measurements in a global
perspective, indirect approaches for estimating the
current ocean storage of anthropogenic CO2 suggest
a global ocean uptake of approximately 2.2 Pg C yr–1

Prior to the launch of satellites, global ocean colour
(i.e., chlorophyll-a concentration or phytoplankton
biomass) datasets were nonexistent. This issue has
since been eliminated with instruments such as
SeaWiFS, which provides the longest historical record
among all ocean colour sensors. The ~9-year SeaWiFS
dataset provides a means to assess the seasonal and
interannual variability of ocean colour on global scales.
The data product used here is the NASA Goddard
OBPG monthly global 9-km product, acquired
using the GES-DISC Interactive Online Visualization
and Analysis Infrastructure (Giovanni). The time
period analysed is from September 1997 through
December 2006.
Global chlorophyll concentrations in 2006 exhibit some
difference from the long-term average, but the significance of the anomalies is difficult to assess
(Figure 3.20). Low concentrations are observed in the
centre of ocean gyres, whereas high concentrations
are detected in ocean margin waters, in equatorial
upwelling regions, in river deltas, at latitudinal belts
greater than approximately 40°N/S, and within the
southern subtropical convergence zone (Yoder and
Kennelly 2003; Behrenfeld et al. 2001). However, the
elevated levels associated with riverine input should
be given special consideration because the signature
observed could be a result of either detritus, colored
dissolved organic matter, or suspended particulate
matter within the water column (Joint and Groom
2000).
Peak chlorophyll concentrations occur during spring
and fall, while minimums occur during winter and
summer (Yoder and Kennelly 2003; Miller 2004).
Typically, the Tropics have low annual productivity,
whereas the temperate and polar regions exhibit high
productivity (Garrison 2005). However, phytoplankton
blooms are observed in the eastern tropical Atlantic

during boreal summer resulting from multiple
mechanisms, one of which is the intensification of the
southeast trade winds (Pérez et al. 2005). The
temperate zone undergoes two peaks in phytoplankton
biomass (i.e., phytoplankton blooms; Garrison 2005).
The larger of these is observed during boreal spring
and the smaller during boreal fall. In comparison, polar
regions experience only one peak in phytoplankton
biomass, which is observed during boreal summer
(Garrison 2005).
A globally averaged time series of chlorophyll-a concentrations from September 1997 to December 2006
reveals low concentrations during boreal winter and
an occasional dip in concentration around boreal
summer (not shown). Peak chlorophyll-a concentrations are observed primarily during boreal spring
(May), with an occasional increase in concentration
during boreal fall. Analysis of chlorophyll-a concentration anomalies from September 1997–December 2006
depict above-normal concentrations of approximately
0.021 mg m–3 in August 1998 and approximately 0.034
mg m –3 in July 2005 (Figure 3.21). The August peak in
1998 is a direct result of the strong 1998–2001 La Niña
event that took place in the equatorial Pacific, whereas
the peak in July 2005 is a combination of a highly
active biological summer season in the eastern tropical Atlantic and northern polar region. Note that the
depicted chlorophyll anomalies are the differences

Other anomalies to highlight are the above-normal
chlorophyll concentration of approximately 0.043 mg m–3
in May 2001 and below-normal concentration of
approximately –0.02 mg m –3 in the boreal fall of 1997
(Figure 3.21). The below-normal concentrations in
1997 are a direct result of the extremely strong 1997/98
El Niño event. The peak in May 2001 is attributed to
the negative state of the NAO. When the NAO index
is negative, phytoplankton biomass and productivity
in the North Atlantic have higher-than-mean conditions

El Niño and La Niña events alter the previously
described seasonal cycle of phytoplankton stocks in
the Northern Hemisphere. Peak concentrations are
observed during boreal summer in La Niña events
and minimal concentrations occur during boreal fall
in El Niño events. Several studies have been conducted
in regard to the central/eastern equatorial Pacific
chlorophyll decrease during the 1997/98 El Niño and
the increase during the subsequent La Niña (Murtugudde
et al. 1999; Chavez et al. 1998, 1999; Wilson and Adamec
2001; Ryan et al. 2002). Each of these studies illustrate
that during a La Niña event, trade wind intensification
prompts thermocline and nutricline shoaling, which
increases the nutrient flux to the surface layer,
generating intense phytoplankton blooms; conversely,
during an El Niño event the thermocline and nutricline
deepen, which impinges upwelling and reduces the
supply of nutrients into the euphotic zone, thereby
limiting chlorophyll production.
The year 2006 marked the beginning of the 2006/07
El Niño event. Both the 1997/98 and 2002/03 El Niños
exhibited their lowest chlorophyll concentrations during the month of December. For the 2006/07 El Niño
it is yet to be known at the time of writing whether
peak below-normal concentrations do in fact occur in
December. However, it is safe to say, based upon the
available chlorophyll data, that the 2006/07 El Niño is
stronger (in terms of its effects on chlorophyll) than
the 2002/03 El Niño (with a below-normal concentration of approximately –0.031 mg m –3 in December
2006 in the Niño-3.4 region compared to approximately
–0.024 mg m –3 in December 2002), but is less intense
than the strong El Niño of 1997/98, which had a belownormal concentration of approximately –0.09 mg m –3
in December 1997 in the Niño-3.4 region.

A.

H. J. DIAMOND,.

OVERVIEW H. J. DIAMOND

This Tropics section consists of global input on the
following three primary topics: 1) ENSO and the tropical
Pacific, 2) TC activity for the 2006 season in seven basins
(the Atlantic, northeast Pacific, northwest Pacific, North
and South Indian, South Pacific, and Australia), and
3) ITCZ behavior in the Pacific and Atlantic basins.
The year was characterized by a transition from La
Niña conditions in the first quarter of the year to
El Niño conditions during the last quarter of the year.
Regarding TC activity, the 2006 Atlantic season was
much different than the 2005 season as follows: the
number of storms dropped from 28 in 2005 to 10 in
2006, the northeast Pacific was a bit more active than
in 2005, and the Australian basin had several strong
storms.

OVERVIEW

El Niño and La Niña episodes represent opposite phases
of ENSO. These episodes are often defined from a time
series of area-averaged SST anomalies in the Niño-3.4
region (called the Niño-3.4 index), which spans the
central and east-central equatorial Pacific between
5°N–5°S and 170°–120°W. During 2006, this index showed
below-average SSTs associated with La Niña during
January–March, followed by a return to near-average

temperatures and ENSO-neutral conditions during
April–July (Figure 4.1). El Niño conditions developed
during August and September, with Niño-3.4 temperatures increasing to more than +1.2°C above average
during November and December.
The surface and subsurface temperature anomaly
patterns show the changes across the central and
east-central equatorial Pacific during 2006 (Figure 4.2).
Between December–February 2005/06 and September–
November 2006, anomalies warmed 2°–3°C across
much of the region (Figures 4.2a,b), and subsurface
temperature anomalies warmed 3°–6°C (Figures 4.2c,d).
This warming is associated with increased depths of
the 20°C isotherm (thick black line), which approximates
the centre of the oceanic thermocline.
The strong coupling between surface and subsurface
temperature anomalies is a well-known characteristic
of both El Niño and La Niña, and reflects their link to
changes in thermocline depth (Figures 4.3a,b). During
La Niña, stronger-than-average tropical easterly winds
in the lower atmosphere produce increased upwelling,

which leads to shallower thermocline depths and
cooler ocean temperatures. Conversely, weaker-thanaverage tropical easterlies during El Niño result in
decreased upwelling, which leads to increased thermocline depths and warmer waters. The transition
from La Niña to El Niño during 2006 was indeed
accompanied by a significant weakening of the
850-hPa equatorial easterlies, which were stronger
than average early in the year (blue shading) and
generally weaker than average after May (orang shading, Figure 4.3c).
The development of El Niño also followed a sharp transition in the overall distribution of anomalous convection
during May and June across the equatorial Pacific
(Figure 4.4). This transition mainly featured a westward
shift in the area of suppressed convection (brown shading) from the date line to the western Pacific. However,
enhanced convection near the date line did not become
established until mid-September, which coincided with
a significant warming of the central and east-central
equatorial Pacific. This anomalous tropical convection
led to several well-known El Niño impacts, including
1) below-average rains across northeastern Australia,
Indonesia, and the western tropical Pacific, 2) fewer

Atlantic hurricanes and more East Pacific hurricanes
than in recent years, 3) above-average temperatures
across the northern half of the United States during
November–December, and 4) stormier- and wetter-thanaverage conditions across the southeastern United
States during November–December.

THE MADDEN–JULIAN OSCILLATION AND KELVIN
WAVE ACTIVITY

Low-frequency variability in the Tropics is strongly
influenced by the MJO (Madden and Julian 1971, 1972,
1994), a tropical disturbance that modulates tropical
convection and atmospheric circulation patterns with
a typical period of 30–60 days. The MJO tends to be

most active during ENSO-neutral years, and can produce
ENSO-like anomalies (Mo and Kousky 1993; Kousky and
Kayano 1994). The low- (850 hPa) and upper- (200 hPa)
level equatorial zonal winds, tropical convection, and
both sea surface and subsurface temperature anomalies
exhibited considerable intraseasonal variability during
2006 in association with the MJO.
The MJO is indicated in a time–longitude section by
continuous propagation of the 200-hPa velocity potential
anomalies around the globe (Figure 4.5). During April–
December, several periods of MJO-related suppressed
convection (brown shading, see Figure 4.4) and
anomalously weak low-level tropical easterly winds
were evident over the western tropical Pacific. These
JAN2006

conditions can initiate oceanic equatorial Kelvin waves,
which are eastward-propagating gravity waves featuring
downwelling in the mixed layer at their leading edge
and upwelling in their wake (Zhang et al. 2001). A typical
eastward propagation rate for these waves is roughly
10° of longitude per week.
Four major Kelvin waves occurred during April–
December, with the amplitude of each wave exceeding
that of its predecessor. Prior to and during El Niño’s
development, these waves acted to significantly modulate the upper-ocean heat content across the central
and east-central equatorial Pacific. The warming associated with the downwelling phase of a particularly
strong Kelvin wave during September prompted NOAA
to report that El Niño had developed. This was followed during November and December by an even
stronger Kelvin wave and additional warming.

SEASONAL ACTIVITY OVERVIEW H. J. DIAMOND and
D. H. LEVINSON

Averaged across all basins, the tropical storm season
of 2006 (2005/06 in the Southern Hemisphere) had a
below-normal (1981–2000 base) number of tropical
storms, fewer HTC, but a greater number of major HTCs
than average. Globally, 78 TS (> 33 kt) were recorded,
with 42 becoming HTCs, and of these 26 attained
major/intense (> 95 kt) status (compared to an average
of 97, 55, and 25 storms, respectively). While 2005 was
a more active season overall, the number of major HTCs
in both 2005 (28) and 2006 (26) were similar.

velocity potential anomalies during 2006. The shading interval
is 3 × 10 6 m2 s –1, and the thick solid contour is the zero line.
Green (brown) shading is indicative of anomalous upper-level
divergence (convergence). Anomalies are departures from the
1971–2000 base period daily means, and are plotted using a
5-day running-mean smoother.

The 2006 season was near average in three basins
(Atlantic, North Indian, and southwest Pacific), slightly
above average in two basins (northeast Pacific and
Australian), and slightly below average in two basins
(northwest Pacific and South Indian). As a result of
El Niño conditions described earlier in the section, the
Atlantic season was notable (e.g., no landfalling hurricanes in the United States versus seven in 2005). The
highlight of the Australian season was the occurrence
of three Australian category 5 storms (Figure 4.6), one
of which was the strongest TC in Queensland since
1918, and one that was the strongest TC ever observed
in the Northern Territory (see sidebar: An Australian
Season of Extremes: Yes, We Have No Bananas).

El Niño’s suppressing influence on Atlantic hurricane
activity is well documented (Gray 1984; Tang and
Neelin 2004; Bell and Chelliah 2006), and is clearly
evident during the current active hurricane era that
began in 1995. During 1995–2006, 9 of 12 hurricane
seasons were in the above-normal tercile, defined as

The reduced activity during 2006 reflects the competing influences of two dominant climate factors. The
first dominant factor is El Niño, which suppressed
activity during September and October through anomalous upper-level convergence and sinking motion
across the Caribbean Sea. Anomalous circulation
features not related to El Niño accentuated this signal
at times, and also contributed to the reduced activity.
The second dominant climate factor was the set of
ongoing oceanic and atmospheric conditions that
have been conducive to above-normal hurricane
seasons since 1995, which remained strong during
the climatological peak months ASO of the season.

El Niño’s typical impacts over the western tropical Atlantic
Ocean and Caribbean Sea include increased vertical
wind shear between 200 and 850 hPa and anomalous
sinking motion in the middle and upper atmosphere.
During ASO 2006, El Niño appears to have suppressed
TC activity mainly by contributing to anomalous

1959

A widely used measure of seasonal activity is NOAA’s
ACE Index (Bell et al. 2000). The ACE Index accounts
for the combined strength and duration of TCs during
the season. The 2006 ACE Index was 90% of the
1950–2000 median value (87.5 × 104 kt2), indicating a
near-normal season (Figure 4.7). This value is well
below the three previous seasons, which averaged
247% (Bell et al. 2005) and less than one-third of the
record high (284%) seen in 2005 (Bell et al. 2006).

1956

The 2006 Atlantic hurricane season produced 10 TSs,
five Hs, and two MHs [categories 3–5 on the Saffir–
Simpson scale (Simpson 1974)]. These values are
slightly below the 1950–2000 averages of 11 TSs,
6 Hs, and 2.5 MHs.

The large-scale El Niño signal during ASO 2006 is
evident in the patterns of anomalous 200-hPa velocity
potential and streamfunction. In the Tropics velocity
potential anomalies are related to the upper-level
divergent circulation and anomalous convection.
Negative velocity potential anomalies across the
central and east-central equatorial Pacific reflect the
El Niño–related enhanced convection and anomalous
upper-level divergence. Positive values over both
the western Pacific/Indonesia region and the Caribbean
Sea refl ect compensating anomalous upper-level
convergence and suppressed convection. Another
characteristic El Niño signature is anomalous upperlevel ridges (positive streamfunction anomalies in
the NH, and negative streamfunction anomalies in
the SH) in the subtropics of both hemispheres flanking
the region of enhanced convection over the central
equatorial Pacifi c. However, this feature was not
evident until October.

Figure 4.7. NOAA’s ACE Index expressed as percent of the
1951–2000 median value (87.5 × 10 4 kt2). ACE is a wind energy
index, and is calculated by summing the squares of the
6-hourly maximum sustained wind speed in knots (Vmax2) for
all periods while the system is a tropical storm, subtropical
storm, or hurricane. Season types are indicated by the
background shading, with pink, yellow, and blue indicating
NOAA’s classifications for above-, near-, and below-normal
seasons, respectively.

upper-level convergence and sinking motion across the
Caribbean Sea. This suppressing influence was particularly notable during September and October, when only
one TC developed over the Caribbean Sea despite low
wind shear (< 8 m s–1) (Figure 4.8a) and anomalously
warm SST. During September, the same conditions, but
with no anomalous sinking motion, led to the formation
of several hurricanes and major hurricanes over the
central and eastern tropical Atlantic Ocean.
SST anomalies during ASO were positive throughout
the North Atlantic (Figure 4.9a). For the entire MDR,
which encompasses the tropical Atlantic Ocean and
Caribbean Sea (Goldenberg and Shapiro 1996), areaaveraged SSTs during ASO were 0.68°C above average,
the second warmest in the historical record dating
back to 1871 (Figure 4.9b). The reduced activity despite
this anomalous warmth is consistent with previous
findings, indicating that local atmospheric circulation
anomalies, rather than local SST anomalies, are the
dominant contributor to seasonal fluctuations in
Atlantic hurricane activity (Shapiro and Goldenberg
1998; Bell and Chelliah 2006).

The vertical wind shear pattern during ASO 2006
primarily reflected anomalously weak shear (relative
to the period 1971–2000) throughout the MDR in association with the ongoing active hurricane era
(Figure 4.8a). A modest El Niño–related increase in
wind shear was evident over the western Caribbean
Sea, but only when the departures are calculated
relative to the current active era (Figure 4.8b).
As with the 200-hPa streamfunction anomalies, there
is little indication that El Niño affected the vertical
wind shear prior to October. Even then, there is little
evidence that the increased shear contributed to the
shutdown in activity. For example, the main suppressing
influence from strong vertical shear (> 8 m s–1) occurred
in August, prior to the time when El Niño began
affecting this field. During September and October,
the shear was quite weak across the Caribbean Sea,
and was, therefore, not a suppressing factor.
Although El Niño appears to be the primary cause for
the reduced TC activity, highly variable circulation

Only three Atlantic tropical storms—Alberto, Beryl, and
Ernesto—struck the continental United States during
2006. Also, this was the first year since 2001 that no
hurricanes struck the continental United States. This
represents a sharp drop in strikes compared to the
preceding four years (2002–05), when an average of
seven named storms and three hurricanes per season
struck the continental United States. In September (four
of the five 2006 hurricanes formed in September), the
deep trough near the US east coast was critical in steering hurricanes out to sea long before they reached the
coast. The overall suppression of activity over the
western part of the Atlantic basin, in part resulting from
El Niño, also contributed to fewer US strikes.
Despite the reduced activity, key oceanic and atmospheric features continued to reflect the ongoing active
Atlantic hurricane era. A main contributing factor to
this active era is the tropical multidecadal signal, which
reflects the leading modes of tropical convective rainfall
variability occurring on multidecadal time scales (Bell
and Chelliah 2006). The ongoing warm phase of the

Other very important and interrelated aspects of the
tropical multidecadal signal and the ongoing active
hurricane era that were also in place during 2006
included 1) an enhanced West African monsoon system
(Landsea and Gray 1992) and suppressed convection
in the Amazon basin, 2) enhanced upper-level ridges
in both hemispheres over the Atlantic Ocean, 3) reduced
wind shear across the tropical Atlantic (Figure 4.10a),
4) an enhanced tropical easterly jet at 200 hPa and

It is not clear why the El Niño signal was manifested
mainly in the upper-level divergence and vertical
motion fields, as opposed to the 200–850-hPa vertical
wind shear, as is typical for most episodes. Also, while
it is possible that the MJO (see section 4B2) may have
accentuated the vertical motion patterns (e.g.,
Mo 2000), no such influence was evident during August
and September. However, it is possible that the strong
MJO signal in October contributed to the suppressed
convection and lack of TC activity across the western
Caribbean Sea in that month.

Atlantic multidecadal mode (Goldenberg et al. 2001),
indicated by a continuation of above-average SSTs in
the North Atlantic (Figure 4.9b), is one important aspect
of the tropical multidecadal signal. Some of this persistent anomalous warmth has also been linked to
increasing global temperatures over the last 100 years
(Santer et al. 2006).

features not linked to El Niño also helped to suppress
the activity. For example, during August increased
vertical wind shear associated with an enhanced
midoceanic trough led to reduced activity across the
central MDR. During September, a deep trough near
the US east coast contributed to an anomalous sinking
motion over the Gulf of Mexico. During October, an
enhanced upper-level ridge over the south-central
United States and western Gulf of Mexico contributed
to the anomalous sinking motion over the Gulf of
Mexico and accentuated the sinking motion over the
Caribbean Sea. These conditions resulted in the third
earliest end (following 1983 and 1993) to seasonal
activity since routine daily satellite coverage began
in 1966.

reduced tropical easterlies at 700 hPa across the tropical Atlantic (Figure 4.10b), and 5) increased cyclonic
relative vorticity across the eastern MDR (Figure 4.10c).
In light of these conditions, there is no indication that
the current active hurricane era has ended. Instead,
the El Niño–related reduction in activity merely represents a short-term break (similar to the 1997 and
2002 El Niño years) in an ongoing string of active hurricane seasons that began in 1995.

EAST PACIFIC BASIN D. H. LEVINSON

(i)

Overview of the 2006 season

below the long-term mean each year (Figure 4.11a).
However, in terms of H and MH, most seasons have
been below normal since the mid-1990s. In fact, since
1995 NOAA has identified 7 of the 12 ENP seasons
as being below normal, and only the 1997 and 2006
El Niño–influenced seasons as being above normal.
This is in sharp contrast to higher activity seen during the preceding 1970–94 period, when only 6 of 24
(25%) hurricane seasons were below normal and
9 of 24 (38%) were above normal.
The ACE Index (Bell et al. 2000; Bell and Chelliah
2006) value for the ENP basin in 2006 was 150.68 ×
104 kt 2, which was above both the long-term mean

The hurricane season in the ENP basin officially begins
on 15 May and continues through the end of November,
with peak activity occurring in September. The ENP
basin includes two subregions officially used by
NOAA/NWS to issue warnings: the east Pacific warning area extends from the western coast of North
America to 140°W, which is the responsibility of
NOAA’s National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida,
while the region between 140°W to the date line is
the responsibility of NOAA/Central Pacific Hurricane
Center collocated at the NWS Weather Forecast Office
in Honolulu, Hawaii.

Comparison of the 2006 season with climatology

Seasonal activity in 2006 was above normal compared
with the climatological mean for the majority of
indices. Figure 4.11 shows the seasonal variability of
TC activity in the ENP basin covering the period
1970–2006. In terms of the number of NSs, which is
the total number of TCs that reached at least minimal
tropical storm strength (sustained winds ≥ 34 kt),
activity in the ENP basin has been near average since
the mid-1990s, fluctuating between slightly above or

ACE Indes (x 10 4 Kt2)

In 2006, the hurricane season in the ENP was above
normal, with a total of 18 NSs, 10 Hs, and 6 MHs
having developed in the basin, which was above the
1971–2000 climatology of 16.4 NSs, 9.6 Hs, and
4.8 MHs each year. In terms of landfalling TCs, the
2006 season was also above average with two hurricanes making landfall along the Pacifi c coast of
Mexico, and one of these as a major hurricane. Over
the period 1951–2000, 1.34 TSs, 1.3 Hs, and 0.3 MHs
annually made landfall along Mexico’s Pacific coast
each year (Jauregui 2003).

and median, and also at the upper end of NOAA’s
definition of a “near normal” season. Prior to the
above-normal 2006 season, there had been a marked
decrease in the ACE Index for the ENP basin beginning
in 1995, with the only exception being the aforementioned 1997 hurricane season that corresponded with
the last strong El Niño event in the Pacific Ocean.
Another interesting aspect of the below-normal
activity in the ENP since 1995 has been the inverse
relationship to the observed increase in activity in
the North Atlantic basin (Lander and Guard 1998),
and the so-called Atlantic multidecadal mode (Landsea
et al. 1998, 1999; Goldenberg et al. 2001; Bell and
Chelliah 2006). Both the maximum wind speed and
the mean maximum wind speed have had a slight
decreasing trend in the last decade. More obvious
has been the decrease in mean hurricane duration
in the ENP basin, which was ~3.9 days in 2006, slightly
below the 4–5 days during the most active years.
The recent decade of low activity reached a minimum
in 2003, and since that time there has been an increase
in all indicators over the past three seasons.
In terms of the timing of activity in the ENP basin, the
2006 season was unusually slow to develop. After the
formation of TS Aletta in late May, no named storms
formed in June, which previously had only occurred
once before (in 2004) during the period of reliable
data. The below-normal activity continued into early
July, because there were no TCs during the first half
of the month; but, cyclogenesis increased dramatically
during the second half of July as three hurricanes (MH
Bud, H Carlotta, and MH Daniel) and one tropical storm
(TS Emilia) developed. Above-normal activity persisted
into August, with five hurricanes, three of which
reached major hurricane strength (Ioke, Ileana, and
John). Of note, MH Ioke, which officially developed
in the central Pacific warning area, reached category
5 intensity and propagated westward past the date
line into the West Pacific basin, becoming a super-TY
during its life cycle. In September, one hurricane (Lane)
and one tropical storm (Miriam) formed, as overall
activity to this point of the season was near normal.
However, both October and November were above
average. Three named storms developed during
October (TS Norman, TS Olivia, and H Paul), which
normally has only two (on average 1 TS and 1 H), while
November 2006 was the most active in the reliable
historical record. Two named storms formed during
the month (TS Rosa and H Sergio), and only in 1966

had there previously been two tropical storms during
any November on record. The final TC of the season,
H Sergio, was the most intense hurricane ever observed
in November (category 2; maximum sustained winds
~95 kt) in the ENP basin, and it was also the longestlived TC for the month, with a record 5.5 days at tropical
storm strength or greater.
(iii)

Environmental influences on the 2006 eastern North
Pacific hurricane season

Previous studies have demonstrated that TC activity
(both frequency and intensity) in the ENP basin is
directly influenced by several large-scale environmental factors, including SSTs, vertical wind shear in the
mid- and upper troposphere, the phase of the QBO in
the tropical lower stratosphere, and the phase of ENSO
in the equatorial Pacific region (Whitney and Hobgood
1997).
In 2006, above-normal vertical wind shear in the
midtroposphere (200–850 hPa) was observed in the
ENP basin during the first half of the season (June–
August; see Figure 4.12). Vertical wind shear anomalies
exceeding 9 m s –1 occurred in the ENP basin’s MDR,
which is the area between 10°–20°N and 90°–130°W

Variability of the tropical atmosphere on interannual
time scales related to ENSO and the QBO has been
shown to modulate seasonal activity, affecting both
the intensity and frequency of TCs in the ENP basin
(Whitney and Hobgood 1997). According to NOAA/
National Hurricane Center, above-normal TC activity
in the ENP basin typically occurs during El Niño years,
while seasons with ENSO-neutral conditions tend to
have less activity, and seasons with the lowest activity
are typically associated with La Niña years. In contrast,
utilizing data covering the period 1963–93, Whitney
and Hobgood (1997) found only a marginal relationship
between ENSO phase and ENP activity, although their
results showed that TCs in El Niño years reach their
maximum intensities slightly farther south and west
than during non–El Niño years. Obviously, the strength
and timing of the SST anomalies associated with ENSO
warm events is an important aspect to this relationship.
The moderate 2006/07 El Niño event developed during
late August and early September, so the phase of ENSO
was transitioning from a neutral to a warm event during
the peak of the hurricane season, and was the major
factor influencing the above-normal season in 2006.
(iv)

Impacts in 2006

There were no landfalling tropical systems in the ENP
during the first half of the season, although four systems
impacted the Mexican coast (TS Aletta, TD 02E,
H Daniel, and TS Emilia). Above-normal activity during
the second half of the season in the ENP basin resulted
in two landfalling hurricanes and rainfall impacts from
the remnants of tropical storms.

Three-month-averaged wind shear anomalies exceeding 12 m s –1 were also measured west of the Baja
Peninsula. In addition to the increased vertical wind
shear, the SSTs were near normal in the MDR during
June and July, while warmer SSTs developed in August
when an area from +0.5° to +1.0°C SST anomalies
developed of f the coast of the Baja Peninsula
(Figure 4.13). The situation changed dramatically during the latter half of the season, as the moderate
El Niño formed in September; the midtropospheric
wind shear anomalies weakened and SSTs increased
in response to the developing warm event. As a result,
warmer-than-normal SST anomalies persisted over
the eastern half of the MDR during September and
October (Figure 4.13).

numerous impacts, including 280 mm of rain at San
Jose de los Planes near the landfall location, the
overflow of the Iguagil Dam in Comundu, coastal
flooding in the Acapulco area, and an official total of
five deaths directly attributed to the storm. Major
Hurricane Lane came ashore at category 3 intensity
with winds ~110 kt along the Peninsula de Guevedo
in Sinaloa. Lane interacted with the coastal mountains,
producing heavy rainfall, flooding, and mudslides
over many areas along the Pacific Coast, with four
fatalities directly attributed to this landfall. Hurricane
Paul, which reached category 2 intensity on 23 October,
resulted in four deaths associated with flooding.

WESTERN NORTH PACIFIC BASIN S. J. CAMARGO

In 2006, a total of 27 TCs (including 3 TDs) occurred
in the western North Pacific. This was below the climatological (1970–2004) median of 31, matching the
25th percentile of the climatological distribution. In
Figure 4.14a the number of TSs, TYs, and super-TYs
per year is shown. There were 24 TCs reaching TS
intensity or higher, according to the JTWC preliminary
reports, but two of them were not named (01W and
17W). The climatological median for NSs: TSs and
TYs is 26; 24 NSs also match the 25th percentile of
the climatological distribution. There were 15 TYs in

51
StateoftheClimate_2006.indd 51

2/22/08 11:19:26 AM

2006, which is slightly below the climatological median
of 16. In contrast, the number of super-TYs in 2006
(7) was in the top quartile of the climatological distribution (median is four, 75th percentile is five). A high
number of intense TYs is typical during El Niño years
in the western North Pacifi c (Camargo and Sobel
2005). Since 1970, when the data are more reliable,
only two other years had more super-TYs than in 2006,
and they occurred in 1997 and 2002, both of which
were El Niño years. Another typical characteristic of
El Niño years is an above-normal occurrence of central
Pacific hurricanes (Chu and Wang 1997; Clark and Chu
2002), with some of the central Pacifi c hurricanes
moving into the western North Pacific, as was the
case with H/super-TY Ioke in 2006.

The 2006 western North Pacific TC season started
slowly in March with a TC that reached TS intensity
(01W), but was given no name. The next TC (Chanchu)
occurred in May and reached super-TY (≥130 kt
maximum sustained winds) intensity. Tropical cyclone
activity continued to be below normal in June and
July, with one and three TCs, respectively, placing
that period in the bottom quartile of the 1970–2004
climatological distribution for those months. In
contrast, August was a very active month with eight
TCs, which is slightly above the 75th percentile of the
distribution of seven; four of these reached T Y
intensity, and two became super-TYs (Saomai and
Ioke). September and October had a normal level of
TCs, with five and four TCs, respectively, equal to the
median of the climatological distribution for those
months. November and December had two TCs,

climatological distribution for those months,
r e s p e c t i v e l y. T h e c u m u l a t i v e d i s t r i b u t i o n
(Figure 4.14b) shows a slightly below-normal season
throughout the year.
The ACE Index (Bell et al. 2000) was slightly above the
climatological median in 2006, in spite of the low
number of TCs, because of the high number of intense
TYs in 2006 (see Figure 4.15a). The seven super-TYs
contributed to 64% of the ACE of the 2006 season; the
largest contribution was from the very long lasting
super-TY Ioke, which provided 17% of 2006 ACE and
had the 15th highest ACE per storm value (in the top
one percentile) of the historical record. The 2006 ACE
per month is shown in Figure 4.15b compared with
the 1970–2004 climatology. In the months of May and
September, values of ACE were in the top quartile of
the climatology, due to the occurrence of super-TYs
Chanchu (May), Ioke (August–September), and Yagi
(September), and T Ys Shansha and Xangsane
(September).
The number of days with TCs that reached TS intensity
or higher in 2006 was 132.25 (based on preliminary
JTWC data), which was below the climatological
median of 159 days, but slightly above the 25th
percentile of the climatological distribution (128 days).
There were 75.5 days with TYs in 2006, which was
above the climatological median of 57.25 days, and
very near the 75th percentile of the 1970 –2004
distribution (76.4 days). There were 32.75 days with
intense TYs (with sustained winds ≥ 96 kt) in the top
quartile of the climatological distribution (75th
percentile is 27.1 days). Figure 4.16 shows a scatterplot
of the number of days with intense TYs and the
Niño-3.4 index (Barnston et al. 1997) for July–October;
note that for higher values of the Niño-3.4 index
(El Niño years) there is a tendency for more days with
intense TYs, as discussed in Camargo and Sobel (2005).
Another typical characteristic of El Niño years is a
tendency for long-lived TCs (Wang and Chan 2002;
Camargo and Sobel 2005). In 2006, 7 of the 24 named
TCs’ lifetimes were longer than the median of the
climatological distribution of 7.25 days. One super-TY,
Ioke, had a very long lifetime of 16.25 days, which is
in the top quartile of the climatological lifetime
distribution. There were, however, many short-lived
named TCs in 2006, nine of which had lifetimes in the
bot tom quar tile of the climatological lifetime
distribution.

A well-known influence of ENSO on western North
Pacific TC activity is a southeast (northwest) shift of
the mean genesis location within the region in El Niño
(La Niña) years (e.g., Chan 1985; Chia and Ropelewski
2002). In 2006, the mean average genesis position of
the NSs was 13.9°N, 139.8°E, which is slightly northwest of the climatological mean genesis position
(12.8°N, 143.2°E; standard deviations: 1.9° latitude,
6.6° longitude). Therefore, the typical southeast shift
of genesis in El Niño years did not occur in 2006.
However, the mean track position of NSs was 18.8°N,
131.2°E, which is slightly east of the climatological
mean position (19.0°N, 134.1°E), largely due to the
contribution of the long-lived Ioke, with a track starting in the central Pacific.
The 2006 El Niño started late and was not very strong,
attaining moderate strength in November after the
peak TY season. Therefore, its influence on the TY
season was not typical. In Figure 4.17a the SST anomalies in the months of July–October (when the peak TY
season occurs) are shown with a slightly positive SST
anomaly in the central Pacific region. As shown in
Chan and Liu (2004), the western North Pacific TY
activity does not have a relationship with local SSTs.
However, there is a relationship with large-scale
dynamics associated with El Niño events, such as the
extension of the low-level anomalous westerlies from
the monsoon trough. In strong and typical moderate
El Niño events, the anomalous westerlies extended
throughout the western North Pacific (see, e.g.,
Camargo et al. 2007). In 2006, however, the anomalous
wes terlies were present jus t wes t of 150° E

(Figure 4.17b). There was no TC genesis in 2006 east
of 150°E, with exception of TYs with more subtropical
genesis locations and Ioke, with a genesis location in
the central Pacific (Chan 2007).
Some interesting events occurred in the 2006 TY
season. Super-TY Chanchu (8–18 May) attained that
status in the South China Sea, a rare occurrence, with
only two other TCs reaching that intensity in the area
before: Ryan (1995) and Sally (1996). Chanchu was
also the earliest system to become a super-TY in the
South China Sea (Padgett 2007). Super-TY Saomai
(4–14 August) made landfall in eastern China, and was
the strongest TY to make landfall in China in the modern record (Padgett 2007). Super-TY Saomai, TS Bopha
(6–10 August), and TY Maria (5–9 August) coexisted
in the western North Pacific, contributing to a very
busy month of August in the basin. Tropical storms
Wukong (12–19 August) and Sonamu (13–16 August)
formed in a large monsoon gyre. The monsoon gyre
is an episodic event, occurring approximately once a
year and lasting from two to three weeks, and often
TCs are produced in the eastern periphery of the gyre

(Lander 1994). Wukong and Saomai underwent a
binary interaction, and the stronger Wukong absorbed
Sonamu, similar to the case described in Lander (1995).
The strongest TC in 2006 was super-TY Yagi, which
did not affect any major land areas.
The 2006 western North Pacific TY season was responsible for many fatalities and economic losses, primarily
in the Philippines and China, with eight and four landfalls, respectively. Other countries affected by TCs in
the 2006 season were Viet Nam, Taiwan Province of
China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea. Bilis
(8–15 July), though only reaching TS intensity, was
responsible for 672 deaths in China and over
US $ 2.5 billion in economic losses due to very heavy
rain, flooding, and landslides. Bilis was soon
followed by TYs Kaemi (8–16 July) and Prapiroon
(28 July–5 August), which also struck China and caused
more economic losses and resulted in over 100 deaths.
Typhoon Xangsane (25 September–2 October) had
significant impacts in the Philippines, where strong
winds and heavy rainfall led to numerous mudflows
and the death of over 200 people, before striking Viet
Nam where 71 deaths were reported. Typhoons Cimaron
(26 October–6 November), Chebi (8–14 November),
Durian (24 November– 5 December), and Utor
(7–14 December) all made landfall in the Philippines.
Typhoon Durian was responsible for at least 720 deaths
resulting from mudslides of volcanic ash, which covered
houses in a large portion of Legazpi City.

INDIAN OCEAN BASINS K. L. GLEASON

North Indian Ocean (NIO)

The NIO TC season extends from April to December,
with two peaks in activity during May–June and again
in November when the monsoon trough is climatologically positioned over tropical waters in the basin.
Tropical cyclones in the NIO basin develop in the Bay
of Bengal and the Arabian Sea typically between
8° and 15°N latitude and are usually short lived and
weak, quickly moving into the subcontinent. However,
strong and “severe cyclonic storms,”5 as illustrated
by Neumann et al. (1993), can develop with winds
greater than 130 kt.

The Bangladesh supercyclone of 1970 produced perhaps the greatest human fatality
toll on record from a TC, where at least 300,000 people died, primarily from the
associated storm surge in the low-lying deltas (Holland 1993).

on 28 April, attained peak intensity, and became the
first major cyclone in the NIO since 2001. Shortly after
attaining peak intensity, MCYC Mala weakened
somewhat before making landfall over Myanmar on
29 April. The hardest hit area was near Yangon, with
more than 100 buildings and numerous power lines
damaged by the strong winds. Extreme storm surge
and large waves caused severe structural damage.
Heavy rainfall associated with Mala also caused
flooding, which resulted in at least 22 fatalities in this
region.

Figure 4.18. Annual tropical cyclone statistics for the North Indian
Ocean over the period of 1970–2006: (a) number of tropical storms,
cyclones, and major cyclones, and (b) the estimated annual ACE
Index (x 104 kt2) for all tropical cyclones during which they were
at least tropical storm or greater intensities (Bell et al. 2000). The
1981–2000 base period means are included in both (a) and (b).
Note that the ACE Index is estimated due to a lack of consistent
6-h sustained winds for every storm.

Using reliable records from 1981 to 2000, a mean of
nearly five NSs (sustained winds ≥ 34 kt), 1.6 TCs
(sustained winds ≥ 64 kt), and one MTC (sustained
winds ≥ 96 kt) form each year in the NIO. The 2006 TC
season was near average with five NSs, one TC, and
one MTC forming from Januar y to December
(Figure 4.18a). Regarding the overall level of TC activity, the estimated ACE Index for the NIO basin in 2006
was nearly 14 × 104 kt2, which was less than the 1981–
2000 mean of 17 × 104 kt2 (Figure 4.18b). In fact, the
annual ACE values in the NIO over the past seven
years have all been below average, indicating a period
of decreased activity. This most recent period of
below-normal activity followed four active TC seasons
with above-average ACE values during the late 1990s
(Figure 4.18b).
Severe TC Mala was the only TY-strength storm to
form during 2006. Mala developed off the western tip
of Sumatra on 24 April and tracked northwest into the
central Bay of Bengal. By 25 April, Mala had intensified
into the equivalent of a category 1 TC on the SaffirSimpson scale and began to accelerate to the northeast.
TC Mala continued to intensify over the next several

South Indian Ocean

The TC season in the SIO is typically active from
December through April and officially extends from
July to June, spanning across parts of two calendar
years. The SIO basin extends south of the equator
from the African coastline to 105°E, although most
cyclones develop south of 10°S latitude. Cyclones in
the SIO that remain east of 105°E are included in the
Australian summary (see section 4C7). The vast majority of SIO landfalling TCs impact Madagascar,
Mozambique, and the Mascarene Islands, including
Mauritius. Due to a lack of historical record keeping
by individual countries and no centralized monitoring
agency, the SIO is probably the least understood of
all TC basins (Atkinson 1971; Neumann et al. 1993).
As a result of the disparate nature of the data in this
region, the SIO historical statistics presented are
incomplete, especially prior to the late-1970s.
Using reliable data from 1981 to 2000, the SIO averages
11.9 NSs, 6.2 TCs, and 2.8 MTCs each year. During the
2005/06 season (July 2005–June 2006), the SIO TC
occurrences were below average with 9 NSs, 3 TCs,
and 3 MTs (Figure 4.19a). The estimated ACE Index for
the SIO during 2005/06 was 55 × 104 kt2, which is slightly
more than half of the 1981–2000 average of 107 ×
104 kt2 (Figure 4.19b). The SIO ACE Index values over
the last three years were below average and the 2006
ACE value was the fifth lowest value since 1980. During
the 2005/06 season, the strongest TC in the SIO was
MTC Carina with 130-kt sustained winds.
The first major TC in the southeast Indian Ocean
formed east of 90° during mid-November 2005 and
was named Bertie. This storm gradually strengthened
and was classified as a severe TC on 21 November.

The most intense TC in the SIO during the 2005/06
season was MTC Carina, which attained peak sustained
winds of 130 kt. Carina developed in late February 2006
southeast of Diego Garcia in the central Indian Ocean
and quickly strengthened into a moderate tropical
storm. While remaining over open waters and among
favorable conditions for development, Carina deepened
and became a MTC as it moved to the southwest. On
28 February, MTC Carina neared category 5 strength

TC Tam was the first TC of the season, which occurred
north of Fiji on 12 January, and tracked toward Tonga
on 13 February, to pass west of Niue, with gale force
winds. Urmil occurred on 15 January, and tracked well
south of Niue with maximum sustained winds of
85 km h –1. TC Jim occurred next, with sustained wind

1999/00

TC Boloetse formed off the eastern coast of Madagascar
during late January 2006. Boloetse intensified into a
tropical storm with sustained winds of 50 kt before
making landfall near the village of Mananjary on
29 January. After crossing the island, Boloetse remerged
and reorganized in the Mozambique Channel. Gaining
intensity, this storm reached a peak intensity of 100 kt
in early February, the equivalent of a category 3 cyclone
on the Saffir–Simpson scale. Eventually, CYC Boloetse
tracked southwest of Madagascar before it transitioned
to being extratropical. Boloetse was the only TC that
made landfall during the 2005/06 season.

1997/98

By the 23 November, Bertie entered the southwest
Indian Ocean and was renamed Alvin. That same day,
Bertie/Alvin reached peak intensity of 115 kt, which is
the equivalent of a weak category 4 TC. The storm
weakened shortly after attaining peak intensity and
dissipated by the end of the month.

The southwest Pacific experienced nine occurrences
(east of 150°E) of TCs during 2006, equal to the average number normally expected for the region in a
year (Figure 4.20). There was also one occurrence
that originated adjacent to the region, just west of
150°E. Many of the seasons’ occurrences affected
the region west of the date line, with the highest
frequency of occurrences in the Coral Sea since at
least 1999/2000 (Figure 4.21). This was consistent
with weak La Niña conditions in early 2006. There
was an even spread of TCs throughout the period
from January to March, and the most severe portion
of the season was in April. Above-average SSTs
combined with enhanced convection over the Coral
Sea, and assisted in the development of TCs in that
area of the basin. Seven of the southwest Pacifi c
basin TCs (71%) reached H strength (sustained wind
speeds of at least 118 km h –1), and three major hurricane strength (sustained wind speeds of at least
168 km h –1).

speeds of at least 155 km h –1 (hurricane force). Jim
was located in the Coral Sea on 28 January, and later
tracked southeast to pass between New Caledonia
and Vanuatu. A mean speed of 154 km h –1 (H force)
was noted at Pekoa in northern Vanuatu on 31 January.
TC Vaianu from 11 to 15 February produced sustained
wind speeds of 140 km h –1. Vaianu affected open
waters near the Wallis and Futuna and Tongan Islands.
TC Kate occurred from 24 to 25 February with sustained
wind speeds of 90 km h –1. Kate was fairly localized,
occurring over the Coral Sea south of Papua New
Guinea. The TCs in March were Larry (18–20 March)
(see section 7) and Wati (19–24 March). TC Wati affected
the open waters west of Vanuatu and New Caledonia,
with estimated maximum wind speeds of 150 km h –1.
TC Monica (see section 7) was the last to affect the
southwest Pacific in mid-April.
The 2006/07 season commenced unusually early,
consistent with El Niño conditions later in the year,
on 22 October. While not part of the TC season
described in this section, we note that two named TCs
for the 2006/07 season occurred prior to the end of
calendar year 2006. TC Xavier occurred from 22 to
25 October, with estimated maximum sustained wind
speeds reaching 215 km h –1, and TC Yani from 22 to
25 November had estimated maximum sustained
wind speeds of 120 km h –1. Both occurred between
the Solomon Islands and Fiji.

AUSTRALIAN BASIN A. B. WATKINS

Weak La Niña–like conditions in the equatorial Pacific
Ocean and warmer SSTs off the northern and eastern
coasts of Australia contributed to the slightly above
average 2005/06 TC season. A total of 12 TCs occurred
in the Australian region between 105° and 160°E,
2 more than the long-term average of approximately
10. However, 3 of these 12 reached category 5 on the
Australian scale, with TC Larry being the strongest
cyclone to make landfall in Queensland since 1918,
and TC Monica the strongest TC ever observed in the
Northern Territory region. In the western Australian/

140

130

Indian Ocean sector, seven TCs were recorded as
follows: Bertie (category 4), Clare (3), Daryl (2), Emma
(1), Floyd (4), Glenda (5), and Hubert (2); and in the
Queensland/Pacific sector, Jim (3), Kate (2), Larry (5),
and Wati (3); and in the Queensland and Northern
Territory region: Monica (5).

INTERTROPICAL CONVERGENCE ZONES

1)

PACIFIC ITCZ A. B. MULLAN

Three convergence zones can be identified in the
Pacific: the ITCZ in the NH at around 5°–10°N; its
Southern Hemisphere counterpart, denoted separately here as SITCZ; and the SPCZ, which extends
diagonally from around the Solomon Islands (10°S,
160°E) to near 30°S, 140°W. The SITCZ only occasionally extends eastward of about 160°W, and west
of this point often merges with the SPCZ, making
it difficult to separate the two features in the southwestern Pacific.
The year 2006 saw a weak La Niña event end in the
first few months, followed by the development of a
moderate El Niño by mid-September that peaked at
the end of the year. La Niña conditions in March–April
are known to promote the appearance of a “double
ITCZ” (Lietzke et al. 2001; Zhang 2001), and Figure 4.22
shows a striking example of this. The SITCZ convection
for March 2006 is continuous from 85°W to west of
the date line, is stronger than a rather broken northern
ITCZ, and shows a clear separation from a weak SPCZ
farther south. Similar convection patterns are evident
in TRMM rainfall data for March 1999 and 2000 (also
La Niña periods), although in those years the separation
from the SPCZ is not as marked. As noted by Gu
et al. (2005), there appears to be some competition

during 2006 for comparison. Note that although the
TRMM rainfall dataset begins in 1998, the long-term
averages are taken from 1999 because extreme
El Niño conditions in the first few months of 1998
distort the rainfall climatology in the SITCZ region.

15, and 20 mm day–1

between the two ITCZs as measured by rainfall, and
the northern ITCZ is weaker at this time than the
prominent SITCZ.
A more typical two–convergence zone pattern is seen
in the rainfall rate for December 2006 (Figure 4.22,
lower panel). A prominent ITCZ is particularly active
east of the date line, and the SPCZ is bowed northward
near 150°W, both features characteristic of El Niño
conditions. For the year as a whole, the TRMM rainfall
data suggest that rainfall was close to the 1999–2005
average over much of the tropical Pacific, with the
exception of enhanced convection in the SITCZ region.
(See section 6H3 for further information on the
SPCZ.)
The seasonal progression of convection through
2006 is shown in Figure 4.23, where area-averaged
rainfall rates have been calculated for the following
three convergence zone regions: ITCZ (0 ° –15°N,
150°E–90°), SITCZ (0 ° –10°S, 150°–80°W); and SPCZ
(0 ° –30°S, 150°E–90°). These boundaries are chosen
after examination of the data to avoid the complications
of the merging ITCZ and SPCZ in the far western
tropical Pacific, and the orographic rainfall over
Central America near 80°W. The SITCZ region is
limited to the east of 150°W, even though at rare
times (Figure 4.22) the southern ITCZ is distinct from
the SPCZ west of this point. In calculating the SPCZ
area-averaged rainfall, the rainfall within the SITCZ
part of the domain is set to zero. To place all three
quite different domains on a more equal footing, the
monthly area averages are normalized by the 1999–
20 0 5 annual average for each region. Thus,
Figure 4.23 shows both the climatological annual
cycle (dotted lines) and the monthly progression

Rainfall in the ITCZ is higher in the second 6 months
of the year, and this climatological pattern was
accentuated during 2006. Rainfall was lower than
normal, particularly in February, and higher than
normal in October through December 2006. This
transition was also apparent in island rainfall records
for the year. The islands of the Federated States of
Micronesia in the western Pacific, which enter their
dry season at the start of the calendar year, were very
dry in some parts (e.g., the northern Marshall Islands)
in the first quarter of 2006. South of the equator,
rainfall in specific island groups was affected by the
ENSO modulation of the SPCZ. The SPCZ was farther
south than usual from January through May, as
expected with La Niña, and farther north than usual
in at least some months at the end of 2006 (e.g.,
December). However, in the area average of the SPCZ
region plotted in Figure 4.23, these local precipitation
fluctuations average out and there is no marked
pattern of precipitation anomalies through the year.
As noted above, precipitation in the SITCZ region,
which occurs mainly from February through April,
was enhanced during 2006.

land–sea temperature contrast, low-level winds, moisture convergence, and the meridional SST gradient
between the North and the South Atlantic (Nobre and
Shukla 1996). Large-scale dynamics given by Kelvin
wave propagation affecting the Walker circulation can
also drive the ITCZ’s interannual variability, because
ENSO is one of the relevant mechanisms of seasonal
influences (Münnich and Neelin 2005).

ATLANTIC ITCZ A. B. PEZZA and C. A. S. COELHO

The Atlantic ITCZ is a narrow but well-organized
convective region that oscillates between several
degrees north of the equator during July–November
and only a few degrees south of the equator in January–
May (Waliser and Gautier 1993). The ITCZ is active all
year-round, demarcating the transition from the
southeasterly to the northeasterly Atlantic trade winds.
A zonally oriented cloud band is usually observed
over the Atlantic Ocean basin extending from the
northeast coast of South America to the northwest
coast of Africa. Convective activity with high rainfall
rates well inland is generally triggered by the nearby
passage of the ITCZ as observed over northern Amazon
in 2006 (Figure 4.24).
The positioning of the ITCZ modulates the rainy season
of northern/northeastern South America and northwestern Africa. Some regions experience a bimodal
monthly rainfall distribution with two peaks—one
when the ITCZ is moving southward and the other
when it is moving back northward. Its seasonal migration and high asymmetry are primarily driven by

High-resolution TRMM data indicate that during 2006
the ITCZ reached its southernmost position in April
(2.5°S) and its northernmost position in August and
September (10°N), and was to the north of its monthly
climatological mean position during a number of
months, particularly during the second half of the
year. As a result, most of the tropical South Atlantic
presented less rainfall in 2006 than the 1998–2005
annual mean value. However, the 2006 ITCZ’s annual
mean position appears close to its climatological
annual mean due to a high variability, with outbursts
of southward displacement from late austral summer
to early austral winter. TRMM also shows a double
ITCZ (Liu and Xie 2002) during April, with a primary
band of convective clouds around 3°N across the
entire equatorial Atlantic, and a secondary band of
clouds around 2.5°S (Figure 4.24).
April featured the interaction and organization of the
secondary ITCZ branch with continental convection
over northern Brazil, resulting in a wider ITCZ to the
west of 30°W. This interaction over northern Brazil
was also noted in May and June (Figure 4.24), decaying in July. The ITCZ became less active from September
to December, with little rainfall observed in September
around 7.5°N in the central North Atlantic and near
the African coast. August was the most active month
for the period from July to December, when some
areas near the African coast experienced high rainfall
rates (Figure 4.24). Interaction with western Africa
rain was irregular during the year, with areas of positive and negative precipitation anomalies observed
over the western tip of the continent. The onset of a
weak El Niño event in the Pacific during mid-2006
contributed to keeping most of the ITCZ convective
activity to the north of the equator for the remainder
of the year, with annual rainfall below average over
most tropical South Atlantic and above average over
the tropical North Atlantic.

AN AUSTRALIAN SEASON OF EXTREMES: YES, WE HAVE NO BANANAS
A. B. WATKINS, H. J. DIAMOND, and B. C. TREWIN
.
The 2005/06 TC season in Australia was
only slightly above average when judged
by TC frequency. When viewed in terms
of intensity, it ranks as one of Australia’s
most extreme TC seasons on record. Of
the 12 TCs of the season, 3 were Australian
category 5, with 1 being the strongest to hit
Queensland in nearly 90 years, and another
being the strongest TC ever reported off
the Northern Territory coast and one of
the strongest ever in the Australian region.
Although only one TC made landfall as category 5, each severe TC had impacts upon a
different state or territory within Australia.
If you lived in Australia and craved a banana
with your cereal, banana chips with lunch,
or the occasional banana daiquiri, then
2006 was just not your year. When TC Larry
blasted across the northern Queensland
coast, it devastated the Australian banana
crop, drastically limiting supply and raising
prices Australia-wide by 400%– 500%,
arguably triggering a small rise in Australia’s
inflation rate.
TC Larry (Figure 4.25) crossed the north
Queensland coast near Innisfail on the
morning of 20 March 2006. Larry reached
category 5 intensity shortly before reaching
the coast, but crossed as category 4.
This was supported by a wind gust of
293.7 km h –1 recorded on the eastern
(leeward) slope of Mount Bellenden Ker at an
elevation of approximately 1450 m, although
by an instrument on a tower at nonstandard
height. Worst affected was the town of
Silkwood, where 99% of the houses suffered
cyclone damage. In total, the immediate
impact of the cyclone caused over $350 million
Australian dollars of insured losses.
TC Larry destroyed between 80%–90%
of the tot al A us tr ali an b an an a c ro p

Figure 4.25. Tropical Cyclone Larry viewed just after landfall, 0730 Australian EST 20 Mar 2006
(Figure 4.26). In addition to limiting supply,
it served to synchronize the crop, which had
been staggered through the year to ensure
a constant supply and stable prices.
The second record TC of the season was
severe TC Monica, which followed a very
long track (Figure 4.27) from the Coral Sea
east of Queensland, crossing the Cape York
Peninsula and then intensifying along the
northern coast of the Northern Territory
before making landfall north of Jabiru on
24 April. During its passage along the
Northern Territory coast, it intensified
into a category 5 system, and one of the
most powerful cyclones witnessed in the
Australian region and the strongest cyclone
ever observed in the Northern Territory.
Estimated wind speeds were in excess of
350 km h –1 on both 23 and 24 April. There
was evidence of a 5–6-m storm surge zone
in Junction Bay.

Figure 4.26. Damage to the banana crop as a result of Tropical
Cyclone Larry

Severe TC Glenda was a small but intense
system that developed rapidly after moving
off the northwest coast of Western Australia
near Kimberley. Glenda reached category
5 intensity with estimated wind gusts to
300 km h –1, but weakened as it approached
the Pilbara coast. It weakened before finally
crossing the coast near Onslow on 30 March
as a marginal category 3.
The 2005/06 TC season in Australia was
clearly one of its most intense on record.
Fortunately, the strongest storms either
missed heavily populated areas or reduced
in intensity at just the right time, and hence,
damage to property and loss of life was kept
relatively low. However, in Queensland at
least, the effect of a severe TC upon agriculture was devastating; an impact ultimately
felt across the country.

OVERVIEW

The permanent presence of sea ice, ice sheets, and
continuous permafrost are unique features of the
polar regions. The Arctic is further distinguished
because it sustains a human population in a harsh
environment. These characteristics amplify the impact
of global climate change on both the regional physical and societal systems. These impacts reach beyond
the Arctic region. For instance, studies are underway
to determine the extent to which the loss of sea ice
cover and the conversion of tundra to larger shrubs
and wetlands, observed to have occurred over the
last two decades, have impacted multiyear persistence in the surface temperature fields, especially
in the Pacific sector. In this report, we provide observations that indicate continuing trends in the state
of physical components of the Arctic system, including the atmosphere, ocean, sea ice cover, and land
(Richter-Menge et al. 2006). The temporal extent of
the data provides a multidecadal perspective and
confirms the sensitivity of the Arctic to changes in
the global climate system.
In 2006 there continue to be consistent signs of a general warming in the Arctic region, most apparent in the
relatively small extent of the winter and summer sea ice
cover and increased greenness of the tundra. However,
there are also indications of a possible deceleration in
the rate of change in some geophysical parameters,
driven by pronounced shifts in atmospheric circulation patterns. These atmospheric circulation patterns
mark a return to patterns that predominated prior to
the mid-1990s. Perhaps correspondingly, the most
recent observations indicate that the upper-ocean
salinity and temperature in the vicinity of the North
Pole and in the Beaufort Sea have relaxed toward
the climatological norms reported since the 1950s.
In 2006 ocean temperatures cooled in the Bering Sea
and there was a slight recovery in the extent of the
summer sea ice cover. The persistence and impact
of the moderating 2006 conditions represents an
intriguing and significant puzzle with respect to the
contemporary global climate system.

ATMOSPHERE

(i)

Circulation regime

The annually averaged AO index in 2006 was slightly
positive, continuing the trend of a relatively low and
fl uctuating index, which began in the mid-1990s
(Figure 5.1). This follows a strong, persistent positive
pattern from 1989 to 1995. The current characteristics
of the AO are more consistent with the characteristics
of the period from the 1950s to the 1980s, when the
AO switched frequently between positive and negative phases.

Surface temperatures and atmospheric circulation

In 2006, the annual surface temperature over land
areas north of 60°N was 1.0°C above the mean value
for the twentieth century (Figure 5.2). The surface
temperature in this region has been consistently

above the mean since the early 1990s. Figure 5.2 also
shows warm temperatures in the 1930s and early
1940s, possibly suggesting a longer-term oscillation
in climate. However, a detailed analysis shows different proximate causes for the 1930s compared to
recent maxima. The early warm and cold periods are
associated with intrinsic variability in high-latitude
circulation patterns; while the recent warm temperatures appear to have an anthropogenic component
(Johannessen et al. 2004; Wang et al. 2007).
In 2006 the regional hot spot of 3°–4°C in springtime
temperature anomalies observed during 2000–05
shifted from the western Arctic (east Siberia, Alaska,
and surrounding waters) to the eastern Arctic (Svalbard
and the Barents Sea) (Figure 5.3). Despite this shift,
positive (warm) anomalies continue to remain over
the entire Arctic. This pattern is in contrast to the North
America/Eurasia dipole patterns of anomalies associated with the two principal atmospheric circulation
features of the twentieth century, the Pacific North
American Pattern and the Arctic Oscillation/Northern
Annular Mode/North Atlantic Oscillation (Quadrelli
and Wallace 2004; Overland and Wang 2005).
(iii)

End of an era for the Bering Sea?

Air and ocean temperatures in the Bering Sea cooled
significantly in 2006 from the previous six-year period
of relatively warm temperatures (Figure 5.4) and
reduced sea ice cover (Figure 5.10), in concert with
Arctic-wide changes (Figure 5.3). Vertically averaged
temperatures from an oceanographic mooring on the
southeastern Bering Sea continental shelf (Stabeno
et al. 2002) recorded temperatures in 2000–05 that
were 2°C warmer than earlier years, with 2005 as
having the warmest summer. Winter 2006 was cold
(note the drop in temperature between fall 2005 and
summer 2006), with a –0.2°C air temperature anomaly
recorded at St. Paul Island for November–April.

Although winter 2006 was cold, the spring ocean
temperatures and ice extent in 2006 were near their
climatological averages because the beginning fall
2005 temperatures were warm. Temperatures in fall
2006, in contrast, started cold and the weather pattern
for November–December 2006 was also cold, with a
–1.0°C anomaly for November–December. The 6-year
period of sustained warm temperatures (2000–05) was
suf ficient to restructure the ecosystem away
from Arctic conditions that favored bottom species,
to favoring midwater fishes (Grebmeier et al. 2006).
Because of the dramatic shift in ocean and ice
conditions in 2006 and the beginning of 2007, the
future state of the Bering Sea ecosystem is now
less certain.

OCEAN

(i)

Surface circulation regime

The circulation of the sea ice cover and ocean surface
layer are closely coupled and are primarily wind
driven. Data from satellites and drifting buoys indicate
that the entire period of 2000–06 has been characterized by an anticyclonic circulation regime resulting
from a higher sea level atmospheric pressure over
the Beaufort Gyre, relative to the 1948–2005 mean,
and the prevalence of anticyclonic winds. The sea
surface atmospheric pressure at the North Pole
together with the Arctic Oscillation index is a good

indicator of the Arctic Ocean and atmosphere circulation regimes (Figure 5.5). During high AO years, the
low SLP dominates over the Arctic Ocean and the ice
drift and ocean circulation are characterized by cyclonic
(counterclockwise) motion. During low AO years, the
high SLP prevails over the Arctic Ocean and sea ice
and the ocean tends to circulate more in a clockwise
sense. The dominance of the anticyclonic regime
during the last decade of 1997–2006 is consistent with
the AO index, which has exhibited relatively low and
fluctuating values since 1996 (Figure 5.5).
(ii)

Heat and freshwater content

From 2000 to 2006, intensive investigations have been
conducted in the vicinity of the North Pole (NPEO;
online at http://psc.apl.washington.edu/northpole/) and
in the western Arctic (BGOS; online at www.whoi.
edu/beaufortgyre/index.html). Observations show that
in the previous decade (1990s) the water temperature
and salinity fields of the Arctic Ocean changed dramatically relative to the climatology of the Environmental
Working Group atlas of the Arctic Ocean (Timokhov
and Tanis 1997, 1998) where water temperature and
salinity from observations were averaged and gridded
for the decades of 1950, 1960, 1970, and 1980.
Hydrographic data acquired at the North Pole in the
Anticyclonic Circulation Regime

1990s show a strong increase in upper-ocean salinity
and a large increase in Atlantic water temperature
relative to EWG climatology average for all decades.
From 2000 to 2005, the oceanographic conditions in
the North Pole region relaxed to near the pre-1990
climatology (Figure 5.6). As characterized by average
temperature and salinity anomalies relative to EWG
climatology within 200 km of the North Pole, the
change in the 1990s and the subsequent retreat to
climatology are roughly consistent with a first-order
response to the AO with a 5-year time constant and
3-year time delay (Morison et al. 2006a). Recent
results indicate conditions in 2006 at the pole reverted
to near 2004 conditions, but measurements of bottom pressure trends from 2002 to 2006 by GRACE

regimes of the Arctic Ocean. Two circulation regimes of surface
waters (anticyclonic: left; cyclonic: right) are shown in blue arrows. In
the cyclonic regime the clockwise circulation pattern in the Beaufort
Sea region (the Beaufort Gyre) weakens, and the flow across the
basin, from the Siberian and Russian coasts to the Fram Strait (the
Transpolar Drift), shifts poleward. The cyclonic pattern dominated
during 1989–96; the anticyclonic pattern has prevailed since 1997.
Sea level atmospheric pressure patterns are shown by lines (hPa)
(adopted from Proshutinsky and Johnson 1997).

suggest a return of oceanographic conditions over
the entire Arctic Ocean to pre-1990s conditions
(Morison et al. 2006b).
The western Arctic hydrography in the 1990s has
also changed relative to climatology but, in opposition to the salinity increase at the North Pole, the
salinity of the upper layer in the western Arctic was
reduced. There are some indications that in the 2000s,
relative to the 1990s, the salinity in this region has
increased, but it is still significantly less than in EWG
climatology. Since 2000, the temperature of the Pacific
and Atlantic waters in the western Arctic is higher
than in the 1990s and 0.8°–1.0°C higher than in EWG
climatology.
The Beaufort Gyre is the major reservoir of freshwater
in the Arctic Ocean. In 2000–06, the total freshwater
content in the Beaufort Gyre has not changed dramatically relative to the climatology but there is a
signifi cant change in the freshwater distribution
(Figure 5.7c,d). The centre of the freshwater maximum
has shifted toward Canada and significantly intensified relative to the climatology. Significant changes
were observed in the heat content of the Beaufort
Gyre (Figure 5.7a,b). It has increased relative to the
climatology, primarily because of an approximately
two-fold increase of the Atlantic layer water temperature (Shimada et al. 2004). The Pacific water heat
content in the Beaufort Gyre region has also increased,
and it is possible that the pronounced sea ice reduction in this r e gion, ob s er ve d in 20 0 6 (s e e
Figure 5.8, right panel), resulted from heat being
released from this layer (Shimada et al. 2006). It is
speculated that the major part of these changes in

the freshwater and heat content occurred in the 1990s,
but there are not enough data to confirm this.
(iii)

Sea level

Figure 5.9 shows sea level time series from nine coastal
stations in the Siberian Seas. These stations are still
operational in the Arctic with data from 1954 to 2006.
There is a positive sea level trend along the Arctic
coastlines. Proshutinsky et al. (2004) estimated that for
1954–89 the rate of sea level rise along Arctic coastlines
(40 stations), corrected for the GIA, was 0.185 cm yr–1.

Figure 5.8. Sea ice extent in (left) March and (right)
September 2006, when the ice cover was at or near its
maximum and minimum extent, respectively. The magenta
line indicates the median maximum and minimum extent
of the ice cover, for the period 1979–2000. The March 2006
maximum extent marked a record minimum for the period
1979–2006. (Figures from the Sea Ice Index, online at nsidc.

The maximum ice extent, typically observed in March,
was 14.4 million km2 and set a record minimum for
the period 1979–2006 (Figure 5.8, left panel). It is
notable that in March 2006 the ice extent fell within
the mean contour at almost every location. In comparison, the mean ice extent for March and September,
for the period 1979–2006, is 15.6 and 6.8 million km2,
respectively.

(SLP) at the North Pole (from the NCEP–NCAR reanalysis
data) multiplied by –1.

For the nine stations shown in Figure 5.9 the rate for
1954–89, after correction for their GIA, was 0.194 cm
yr–1. Addition of 1990–2006 data increases the estimated
rate of increase in sea level, beginning in 1954, to
0.250 cm yr–1. The sea level time series correlates relatively well with the AO index and with the inverse of
the SLP at the North Pole. Consistent with these influences, sea level dropped significantly after 1990 and
reached a minimum in 1996/97 when the circulation
regime changed from cyclonic to anticyclonic. In contrast, from 1997 to 2006 the mean sea level has generally
increased in spite of the more or less stable behavior
of the AO and SLP. At this point, because of the large
interannual variability, it is difficult to evaluate the significance of the change in relative trends.

SEA ICE COVER

(i)

Extent and thickness

Satellite-based passive microwave images of the sea
ice cover have provided a reliable tool for monitoring
changes in the extent of the ice cover since 1979.
During 2006, the minimum ice extent, typically observed
in September, reached 5.9 million km2 (Figure 5.8,
right panel). This marked a slight recovery from the
record minimum of 5.6 million km2 for the period
1979–2006, observed in 2005. Consistent with the past
several years, the summer retreat of the ice cover was
particularly pronounced along the Eurasian and North
American coastlines. A unique feature was the isolated
region of open water apparent in the Beaufort Sea.

To put the 2006 minimum and maximum ice extent
into context, the time series of the variability of ice
extent in March and September for the period 1979–
2006 are presented in Figure 5.10. In both cases, a
negative trend is apparent with a rate of 2.5% decade –1
for March and 8.9% per decade for September relative
to the 1979 values. The summers of 2002–05 marked
an unprecedented series of extreme summer ice extent
minima (Stroeve et al. 2005).
Ice thickness is intrinsically more difficult to monitor.
With satellite-based techniques (Laxon et al. 2003;
Kwok et al. 2004) only recently introduced, observations have been spatially and temporally limited. Data
from submarine-based observations indicate that the
ice cover at the end of the melt season thinned by an
average of 1.3 m between the period 1956–78 and the
1990s, from 3.1 to 1.8 m (Rothrock et al. 1999).
Measurements of the seasonal ice cover do not indicate any statistically significant change in thickness
in recent decades (Melling et al. 2005; Haas 2004;
Polyakov et al. 2003).

a precipitous decrease in the perennial ice extent in
the last few years.

Perennial and seasonal ice

The Arctic sea ice cover is composed of perennial ice
(the ice located toward the center of the Arctic Basin
that survives year-round) and seasonal ice (the ice
around the periphery of the Arctic Basin that melts
during the summer). Consistent with the diminishing
trends in the extent and thickness of the cover is the
observation of a significant loss of the older, thicker
perennial ice in the Arctic (Figure 5.11). Results from
a simulation using drifting buoy data and satellitederived ice concentration data to estimate the age
distribution of ice in the Arctic Basin (Rigor and Wallace
2004) indicate that the March ice cover has experienced
a significant decline in the relative amount of perennial
ice over the period 1958–2006, from approximately
5.5 to 3.0 million km2 . While there is significant
interannual variability, a general decrease in the
amount of perennial ice appears beginning in the early
1970s. This trend appears to coincide with a general
increase in the Arctic-wide, annually averaged
surface air temperature, which also begins around
1970 (Figure 5.2).
Results from a new technique employing data acquired
by the NASA SeaWinds scatterometer on board the
QuikSCAT have recently become available (Nghiem
et al. 2005, 2006; Nghiem and Neumann 2007). In the
half-decade of overlap, which begins in 2002 and
represents the period of data reprocessed to date by
the QSCAT project, the two products provide consistent estimates of perennial ice in March and suggest

Figure 5.12 presents a comparison of the ice distribution
derived from the drift age model and observed by
QSCAT in March 2006. The two products provide
strikingly similar results. Both indicate that the older,
thicker ice is concentrated in the western Arctic Basin.
This result is consistent with the dominant ice
circulation patterns in the Arctic (see Figure 5.5). Ice
residence times are typically longer in the western
Arctic in the region of the Beaufort Gyre. The eastern
Arctic is dominated by the Transpolar Drift, which
carries sea ice out of the Arctic basin via the Fram
Strait.
A relatively younger, thinner ice cover, similar to the
one that has developed in recent years, is intrinsically
more susceptible to persistent atmospheric or oceanic
warming. It is of crucial importance to observe whether
the sea ice cover will continue its decline or recover
under the recent, more neutral AO conditions, which
have shown to be more conducive to ice growth.

surface in the red and near-infrared channels. If the
climate warms, higher NDVI values might be expected
to shift northward. Earlier global studies of NDVI
changes indicated a general pattern of increased NDVI
in the region between 40° and 70°N during the period
1981–99 (Myneni et al. 1997, 1998; Zhou et al. 2001;
Lucht et al. 2002). Studies of the NDVI in the tundra
area of northern Alaska indicate an increase of 17%
in NDVI values in this region where the SWI measured
at ground stations across northern Alaska has been
increasing by 0.16°–0.34°C yr–1 during the same period
(Figure 5.13) (Jia et al. 2003).
A more recent analysis indicates that different patterns of greening have occurred in the boreal forest
and tundra areas of North America (Goetz et al. 2005).
The NDVI has increased in tundra regions by an
average of about 10% for all of North America,
whereas the NDVI has declined in the boreal forest
regions particularly during the past 10 years.

Permafrost

At the present time, there is no remote sensing technique to remotely and extensively monitor permafrost
temperatures. Long-term permafrost temperature
data are available only from a few clusters of stations,
mostly in North America. However, the situation could
improve as a result of implementing an INPO, which
is the major goal of the IPY TSP project. Observations
from the long-term sites show a general increase in
permafrost temperatures during the last several
decades in Alaska (Osterkamp and Romanovsky 1999;
Romanovsky et al. 2002; Osterkamp 2003), northwest
Canada (Couture et al. 2003; Smith et al. 2003), Siberia
(Pavlov 1994; Oberman and Mazhitova 2001;
Romanovsky et al. 2002; Pavlov and Moskalenko 2002),
and northern Europe (Isaksen et al. 2000; Harris and
Haeberli 2003). Uninterrupted permafrost temperature
records for more than a 20-year period have been
obtained by the University of Alaska Fairbanks along
the International Geosphere–Biosphere Programme
Alaskan transect, which spans the entire continuous
permafrost zone in the Alaskan Arctic. All of the observatories show a substantial warming during the last
20 years. This warming was different at different locations, but was typically from 0.5° to 2°C at the depth
of zero seasonal temperature variations in permafrost
(Osterkamp 2005). In 2006, there was practically no
change to the mean annual temperatures at the permafrost surface if compared to 2005 (Romanovsky
et al. 2006). These data also indicate that the increase
in permafrost temperatures is not monotonic. During
the observational period, relative cooling has occurred
in the mid-1980s, in the early 1990s, and additionally
in the early 2000s. As a result, permafrost temperatures
at 20-m depth experienced stabilization and even a
slight cooling during these periods.
Very similar permafrost temperature dynamics were
observed in the European north of Russia during the
same period (Figure 5.14). However, there is some lag
in the soil temperature variations at the Alaskan sites
compared to the Russian sites. This observation is
similar to what was discovered in comparison with
permafrost temperature dynamics in Fairbanks, Alaska,
and Yakutsk, Russia (Romanovsky et al. 2007). Relative
cooling has occurred in the Vorkuta region in the early
and late 1980s and then in the late 1990s. The total
warming since 1980 was almost 2°C at the Vorkuta
site.

permafrost table was unfrozen during the entire winter.
The active layer in the summer of 2006 was also one
of the deepest on record at most of the observation
sites in the Fairbanks area, even though the summer
air temperatures were close to normal.

permafrost observatories in northern Russian Federation.
Bottom: Changes in permafrost temperatures at 15-m
depth during the last 20–25 yr (Oberman 2007).

Data on changes in the ALT in the Arctic lowlands are
less conclusive. In the North American Arctic, ALT
experiences a large interannual variability, with no
discernible trends. This is likely due to the short length
of historical data records (Brown et al. 2000). A noticeable increase in the active layer thickness was reported
for the Mackenzie Valley (Nixon et al. 2003). However,
this positive trend was reversed into a negative trend
at most of these sites after 1998 (Tarnocai et al. 2004).
An increase in thickness of more than 20 cm between
the mid-1950s and 1990 derived from historical data
collected at the Russian meteorological stations was
reported for the continuous permafrost regions of the
Russian Arctic (Frauenfeld et al. 2004; T. Zhang et al.
2005). At the same time, reports from several specialized permafrost research sites in central Yakutia show
no significant changes in the active layer thickness
(Varlamov et al. 2001; Varlamov 2003). The active layer
was especially deep in 2005 in interior Alaska. Around
Fairbanks the 2005 active layer depth was the deepest
observed in the past 10 years. Data from many of
these sites show that the active layer developed during the summer of 2004 (one of the warmest summers
in Fairbanks on record) and did not completely freeze

Snow extent

As dicussed in section 2C2, NOAA has produced snow
extent charts since 1966 (Robinson et al. 1993; Frei
and Robinson 1999). These charts were primarily
derived from the manual interpretation of visible band
imagery until 1999, when passive microwave and
other data sources became available (Ramsay 1998;
NOAA/NESDIS/OSDPD/SSD 2004, update 2006).
Passive microwave data can enhance snow measurements based on visible data alone, sensing the surface
through clouds and in darkness. However, passive
microwave may not detect some areas of shallow
snow that can be seen in visible band imagery. As a
result, time series from the two sources can differ.
Figure 5.15 shows mean snow cover for the 1966–2006
period. Figure 5.16 compares a microwave data–derived
snow cover dataset (Armstrong and Brodzik 2001;
Armstrong et al. 2005b) with NOAA snow extent data.
Both show similar interannual variability and consistently indicate Northern Hemisphere maximum extents
exceeding 40 million km2 . The NOAA time series
indicates a decreasing trend of –2.0% decade –1 (Brodzik
et al. 2006). There is a decreasing trend of –0.7%
decade –1 in the microwave snow cover, although it is
not significant at the 90% level. Both sources indicate
a decreasing trend in snow cover in every month but
November and December. The strongest seasonal
signal occurs during May–August when both indicate
significant decreasing trends. The western United
States is among the regions with the strongest decreasing trends, supporting Groisman et al. (2004) and Mote
et al. (2005) results using in situ observations. Shallow
snow cover at low elevations in temperate regions is
the most sensitive to temperature fluctuations and
hence most likely to decline with increasing temperatures (IPCC 2007).

Glaciers and ice caps, excluding those adjacent to the
large ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica, can be
found on all continents except Australia and have an

estimated area between 512 and 540 × 103 km2. The
complicated and uncertain processes that control
how fast glaciers move make it difficult to use changes
in the areal extent of glaciers as a straightforward
indicator of changes in climatic conditions. Further,
many large collections of glacier photographs are
available, but it is only in the last decade or so that
remote sensing imagery has provided a means to
monitor changes in the areal extent of glaciers. The
Global Land Ice Measurements from Space glacier
database project, with participation from more than
60 institutions in 28 nations, is working now on a
baseline study to quantify the areal extent of existing
glaciers (Armstrong et al. 2005a).

Mass balance measurements, or the difference

of a glacier. Changes in mass balance correspond to
changes in glacier volume. These measurements are
typically obtained from less than about 0.2% of the
world’s glaciers. Researchers have measured mass
balance on more than 300 glaciers since 1946, although

a continuous record exists for only about 40 glaciers
since the early 1960s. Nevertheless, considerable
compilation and analysis has occurred (e.g., Cogley
2005). These results indicate that in most regions of
the world, glaciers are shrinking in mass. From 1961
to 2003, the thickness of “small” glaciers decreased
approximately 8 m, or the equivalent of more than
6,000 km3 of water (see http://nsidc.org/sotc/glacier_
balance.html). Recent mass loss of glaciers and ice
caps is estimated to be 0.51 ±0.32 mm SLE per year
between 1961 and 2003 and 0.81 ±0.43 mm SLE per
year between 1993 and 2003 (Dyurgerov and Meier
2006; online at http://nsidc.org/sotc/sea_level.html).
The greatest mass losses per unit area are found in
Patagonia, Alaska, and the northwest United States/
southwest Canada. However, because of the
corresponding large areas, the biggest contributions
in total to sea level rise come from Alaska, the Arctic
and the Asian high mountains.

River discharge

The river discharge database R-ArcticNet (available
online at www.R-Arcticnet.sr.unh.edu) was extended
up to 2004 for 48 downstream river gauges. The last
five years were characterized by an increase of total
discharge to the Arctic Ocean mainly due to a contribution from Asian rivers. Mean 2000–04 discharge
from Asia was 110 km3 (5%) higher than over the previous 20 years. The mean discharge to the ocean from
North America and Europe for 2000–04 was practically
unchanged relative to 1980–99. A consistent increase
in river discharge is observed from Eurasia for a longer
time interval as well. Mean discharge over 2000–04
for the large Eurasian rivers was 3%–9% higher than
the discharge over 1936–2004. Thus, the contemporary
data further confirms the presence of a significant
increasing trend in the freshwater discharge to the
Arctic Ocean from Eurasia documented earlier by
Peterson et al. (2002). The maximum total discharge
of the six largest Eurasian rivers over 1936–2004 was
observed in 2002, at 2080 km3 yr–1.

OVERVIEW T. SCAMBOS

The Antarctic climate pattern and mean circulation is
stabilized by the presence of the encircling Southern
Ocean (for discussion here, the portions of the major
oceans south of 50°S; definitions vary), and by the
huge, roughly pole-centered ice plateau of the Antarctic
continent. It is characterized by intense eastward-moving polar cyclonic systems and strong off-continent
katabatic flow. Nevertheless, it is also strongly influenced by climate patterns to the north (e.g., ENSO;
Bromwich et al. 2004a; Turner 2004), and it exhibits
large circulation shifts that are correlated with changes
to these broad temperate and tropical patterns. These
changes in the atmospheric circulation in turn influence the formation and drift of Antarctic sea ice. The
Southern Ocean sea ice cycle represents the thirdlargest annual change of the Earth’s surface (after
Northern Hemisphere leaf out, and seasonal northern
snow cover), and its growth and retreat has a very
large influence on heat and moisture transport to the
atmosphere, as well as on the southern oceanic
ecosystem.
The year 2006 continued the recent trend of warming
in the peninsula and offshore west Antarctica, and a
trend of moderate and shorter-duration anomalies in
the SAM circulation index (Figures 5.17 and 5.18). While
annual averages for the high southern latitudes showed
broad patterns of mildly warmer-than-average
conditions, there were several anecdotal indications
of a cool austral winter in 2006 (snow in South Africa;
iceberg remnants off southern New Zealand). The
annual mean SAM index was weakly positive, but
there were several significant circulation shifts during
the year. Sea ice trends were remarkable in that the
year included both the record minimum and record
maximum ice extents relative to the 1979–2006 period
(the period of accurate satellite observations), possibly
linked to the shifts in circulation pattern during the ice

growth period. The extent of seasonal melt during
the 2005/06 spring–summer period was quite low
overall, but included an anomalously long melt event
for the northeastern Ross Ice Shelf and Shirase Coast.
While springtime ozone depletion reached record
proportions by a small margin, it is still anticipated
that detectable decreases in springtime ozone loss
will occur by 2023.

of 20°S. The year 2006 showed several significant
SAM anomalies, particularly in May and August, when
the SAM was more than one standard deviation above,
and two standard deviations below, its 1979–2005
mean, respectively (Figure 5.18). Overall, the year
showed a mildly positive SAM index, continuing a
trend toward positive mean SAM over the past several
decades (Figure 5.18, inset).
Based on an examination of monthly mean patterns,
we divided the Antarctic 2006 climate into five multimonth periods (Figure 5.18, top), and in Figure 5.19
we examine their 850-hPa height and surface temperature anomalies. Strong geopotential height and
pressure decreases across Antarctica, and corresponding rises in the southern midlatitudes, are seen for
the May–June–July period (Figure 5.19e), in association with the positive SAM index noted above. This
led to warmer-than-average temperatures in the
Weddell Sea by up to 6°C (Figure 5.19f); and cooler
temperatures over offshore Dronning Maud Land and
Enderby Land (0°–60°E), again by 6°C. An abrupt shift
to nearly opposite conditions, with opposing-sign
temperature anomalies, occurred during the August–
September period (Figure 5.19h). This period also
showed intensely warm conditions (up to 10°C above
mean) for the eastern Ross Sea and Ross Ice Shelf
area.

The SAM has been characterized by high month-tomonth variability since 2003. Notably, December 2006
initiated a mild El Niño event, which tends to produce
positive height/pressure anomalies in the Amundsen–
Bellingshausen Seas. However, Figure 5.19i shows
that a negative height anomaly was observed in this
region during October–December, which suggests
there was no significant climate teleconnection to the
South Pacific from the late-onset 2006 El Niño at that
time.

(warm in March–April, cooler generally in May–July)
for the east Antarctic bases concur with the regional
plots shown in Figure 5.19. In the northeastern peninsula, surface observations from a number of stations
operated by Argentina (Skvarca et al. 2006) indicate
a very warm 2005/06 austral summer period, among
the warmest during the preceding 30 years, during
which extensive melt and melt ponding was observed.
However, temperatures for the western peninsula were
only slightly greater than the mean.

The long-term radiosonde record from these stations
and several others has indicated that a midtropospheric, winter season warming has been taking place
above the Antarctic in recent decades (Turner et al.
2006). At Syowa station on the coast of east Antarctica,
temperatures at the 500-hPa level have risen by 0.7°C
decade –1 over the last 30 years. During 2006, however,
the winter 500-hPa temperatures at Syowa were
below average after near-record warm temperatures
in 2005, 2003, and 2002.

SURFACE MASS BALANCE A. MONAGHAN and
D. BROMWICH

Snowfall accumulation is the mass input to the Antarctic
ice sheets, and is the net result of precipitation, sublimation/vapour deposition, drifting snow processes,
and melt (Bromwich 1988). Of these, precipitation
(almost entirely in the form of snowfall) is the dominant term of surface mass balance at regional and
larger scales (Genthon 2004); only in relatively limited
areas does ablation equal or exceed snow input,
although recent remote sensing analyses suggest
these may be more widespread than previously thought
(firn “glaze” areas of near-zero accumulation; Scambos
et al. 2006). Atmospheric models have been the primary means of assessing the variability of Antarctic
snowfall for periods longer than a decade (e.g.,
Bromwich et al. 2004b). More recently, satellite radar
altimetry (e.g., Davis et al. 2005) and other satellitebased techniques (e.g., Velicogna and Wahr 2006) are
increasingly being used to study surface and total ice
sheet mass balance for periods of <1 decade. The
most recent model studies and observational data
indicate there has been no trend in snowfall in recent
decades (Van de Berg et al. 2005; Monaghan et al.
2006).

Figure 5.21. Detrended precipitation anomalies (% yr–1)
from NN2 for 2006 compared with the 1979–2006 mean

Precipitation fields from the NOAA/NWS/NCEP/DOE
Reanalysis II (NN2; a successor to the NCEP–NCAR
Reanalysis) are employed here to assess Antarctic
snowfall for 2006. In recent studies (e.g., Bromwich
et al. 2004b), snowfall trends in NN2 have been found
to have an anomalous upward trend from 1979 onward,
compared to other model-based records, snow-stake
measurements, and ice core records; however, the
interannual variability of the snowfall is in very good
agreement with other models (Monaghan et al. 2006).
Therefore, a detrended NN2 record (linear mean trend
subtracted) roughly approximates the “flat” trends
that more accurate models predict. Using this we
calculate a 2006 snowfall anomaly pattern compared
to the 1979–2006 mean (Figure 5.21).
In general, the anomaly over the continent interior is
negative, and is positive over most of the Antarctic
Peninsula and western Weddell Sea. Smaller positive
trends over the Amery and northern Ross Ice Shelves
suggest that the mean wavenumber-3 pattern
(Figure 5.17a) had a strong impact on precipitation.
While the pattern of precipitation anomaly and circulation anomaly are consistent with a mildly positive
SAM for 2006, the link between the SAM and precipitation is not as robust as the link for temperature
(Genthon et al. 2003). Continentwide, the mean anomaly is small (–6%), with no month exceeding two
standard deviations from the mean. The observed

SEA ICE EXTENT AND CONCENTRATION R. MASSOM,
S. BARREIRA, and T. SCAMBOS

Sea ice extent anomalies varied widely during the
year, from record-low January and March extent
(March was –18% relative to the 1979–2006 mean) to
record highs of +4% for September and October, based
upon analysis of monthly mean SSM/I-derived sea ice
concentration data produced by the NSIDC Sea Ice
Index project (Figure 5.22; see Fetterer and Knowles
2004). However, by December 2006, sea ice extent
was below average again. Strong regional variability
is also apparent in ice extent and concentration
anomalies. For the austral sea ice minimum period
(February–March), the record low is primarily a result
of greater-than-average March retreat in the Weddell
Sea. This is likely a result of the intense warmth (up
to 5°C above average) in the eastern Weddell in March,
and a circulation pattern that favored southward and
eastward wind-driven drift of the pack. In the autumn
growth season, positive anomalies in the Amundsen
Sea and western Indian Ocean sectors are balanced
by negative anomalies in the South Atlantic (Weddell
Sea) and Ross Sea/WPO sectors. The winter ice cover
in August is characterized by major negative anomalies
(indicative of wind-driven ice compaction) in the
Bellingshausen–Amundsen Seas plus WPO sectors
and a lesser negative anomaly skirting the Greenwich
meridian. These are counterbalanced by equally large
positive anomalies in the Weddell Sea, Ross Sea, and
Indian Ocean sectors. This pattern persisted through
September–October. In fact, the Indian Ocean sector
experienced large positive extent and concentration
anomalies from April through November. Locations
of extent anomalies, and the overall record extent
during the winter maximum, suggest an influence
from the earlier positive SAM mode and strong positive wavenumber-3 anomaly, and the presence of
lower-than-average temperatures near the winter ice
edge (see Massom et al. 2006; Raphael 2004).

The 25 season mean melt extent is 1.277 million km2,
or 9.34% of the continent’s area. During the 2005/06
summer, melt extent, including all areas with at least
one day of surface melting, was 1.009 million km2,
or 7.4% of the continent (Figure 5.23). This is the
second lowest extent during this period, af ter
1999/2000 (Liu et al. 2006). The 2005/06 melt season
extended from 5 November to 4 March. Peak melt
extent occurred on 7 January.
Extensive and continuous melt occurred on the ice
shelves of the Antarctic Peninsula, and the Amery,
Abbot, West, and Shackleton Ice Shelves. Melt areas
are also scattered along the coasts of Wilkes Land
and in glacial valleys in the Transantarctic Mountains.
A brief but extensive surface melting occurred over
the west Antarctic ice streams and Ross Ice Shelf

with warm air temperature anomalies there during
this time (Figure 5.19b). Regionally, 2005/06 was a

2006 AUSTRAL SPRINGTIME OZONE
DEPLETION P. A. NEWMAN, B. J. JOHNSON, D. LUBIN,
S. J. OLTMANS, and R. C. SCHNELL

Springtime ozone depletion in 2006 was by a small
margin the most severe ever recorded as measured
from the NASA Aura satellite’s OMI. The ozone
hole’s area had an average late-September extent of
27.4 million km2 (Figure 5.24). The ozone hole area
is estimated by integrating the area of observations
with total ozone values less than 220 DU from the
NASA TOMS instruments and the Aura OMI satellite
instrument. A record-minimum column ozone abundance of 85 DU was recorded on 8 October over east
Antarctica. This is consistent with the extremely cold
temperatures in that same altitude range during this

period (~ –85°C), which led to extensive PSC formation.
Aura MLS observations revealed high ClO abundances
(>1 ppbv) filling nearly all of the polar vortex. While
the 2006 ozone depletion was severe, it began about
two weeks later than the mean of those years with
comparable severity (Figure 5.24).

Despite its severity, the 2006 event does not necessarily
signify a worsening of polar ozone depletion. Ozone
depletion over Antarctica is highly sensitive to the
dynamics of the winter stratospheric polar vortex,
and this dynamical variability has yielded significant
interannual variability in springtime ozone depletion
over the past decade. For example, the weak and split
polar vortex of 2002, accompanied by an anomalously

The total column of O3 (blue line) is in Dobson units
(and the 20–24-km stratospheric temperature (red line)
illustrates the development of the O3 hole over South
Pole Station in 2006. The severity of O3 depletion
depends on wintertime stratospheric temperatures,
the stability of the polar vortex, and active chlorine
levels. The 2006 measurements showed some of the
lowest O3 amounts ever in the 21-year record at South
Pole. Average total column of O3 was 270 DU in July
through mid-August before stratospheric O3 began
the now-typical, steady decline throughout September.
Stratospheric temperatures remained colder than
normal during that month. The total O3 minimum of
93 DU at the South Pole (shown in Figure 5.25c) was
measured on 9 October, consistent with the satellite
observations. This low value occurred about one week
later than normal, and was the third lowest minimum
observed since South Pole measurements began in
1986. The depletion was the largest ever observed
within the primary O3 layer from 14 to 21 km, dropping
from 125 DU in late July to a record low of 1.2 DU
(99% depletion) in early October. The polar vortex
remained stable over the Antarctic for the final
weeks of 2006, resulting in a slow recovery in
stratospheric O3. Significant amounts of ozone-enriched
air transpor ted from midlatitudes eventually
reached the South Pole on 8 December, as shown in
Figure 5.25a and 5.25d, when total O3 increased to
301 DU.

warm stratosphere, led to a very mild springtime
ozone depletion. During 2006, the polar vortex was
much colder than average. These colder temperatures
resulted from a weaker tropospheric planetary
wave–driven warming of the stratosphere during the
July–September period (related to the positive anomaly
in 850-hPa level in Figure 5.19g). Given these conditions,
the severe 2006 ozone depletion is consistent with
the decadally averaged abundance of anthropogenic
ODS (mainly chlorofluorocarbons). ODS abundances

have only recently started to decline in response to
the Montreal Protocol; the rate of this decline is ~0.6%
year–1, not yet enough to reduce the severity of the
springtime ozone depletion over Antarctica. According
to models by Newman et al. (2006), ODS mitigation
resulting from the Montreal Protocol should yield a
decreaseinAntarcticozonedepletionbeginningaround2010,
detectable at the 2σ level by 2023, and with a
disappearance of the springtime ozone depletion
phenomenon by 2070.

A.

OVERVIEW A. ARGUEZ

While a holistic (global) view of the 2006 state of the
climate is a worthwhile vantage point, much can also
be gleaned by analyzing individual continents, countries,
and subregions. This section represents such a “downscaling” approach, as 2006 weather conditions over
smaller geographic areas are not only described and
put in a historical context, but international and interregional contrasts are also brought to light. The section
is divided into seven sections: Africa, North America,
Central America and the Caribbean, South America,
Asia, Europe, and Oceania. These regions are further
subdivided into practical climate divisions. Country and
regional names utilized in this section do not, in any
shape or form, reflect any political bias or sympathy. In
addition, please note that varying base periods are often
utilized for the computation of climate anomalies.

AFRICA A. ARGUEZ

Precipitation was generally above average over much
of Sub-Saharan Africa in 2006 (Figure 6.1). Several flood
events and droughts occurred, causing substantial losses
to human life and property. Most of Africa was slightly
warmer than average for 2006 (Figure 6.2). The following
section discusses the state of the climate in four distinct
regions: eastern Africa, northern Africa, southern Africa,
and western Africa (including the Sahel).

The GHA countries experienced heavy rainfall leading
to severe flooding (the worst in the region for 50 years),
causing loss of life and property in the region from
October to November 2006. The worst hit were parts
in Ethiopia, Somalia, and Kenya. Flood waters from
the Juba River in Somalia and the Tana River in Kenya
combined to inundate a large region of northeastern
Kenya. Several rivers burst their banks, washing away
roads and destroying bridges.
Climatologically, the timing of the rainy seasons in East
Africa is governed by the meridional migration of the
ITCZ through the course of the year. Although the
complex orography and presence of the East African
lakes make the climate of the region quite complicated,
three general regimes can be delineated. In the southern

sector, the central and southern parts of the United
Republic of Tanzania have a unimodal rainfall regime,
with precipitation primarily between December and
April. Northern and northeastern United Republic of
Tanzania, most of Kenya, southern and eastern Ethiopia,
and most of Somalia comprise the equatorial sector,
which generally exhibits a bimodal rainfall regime, with
the “long rains” during March–May and the “short
rains” during October–December. In the northern sector, which includes much of central and western Ethiopia,
western Eritrea, and much of Sudan, the major rainy
season occurs during the months of June–September.
In addition to a peak in rainfall centered on July and
August, areas of north-central Ethiopia, eastern Eritrea,
and Djibouti also experience a climatological rainfall
maximum during March–May.
East Africa experienced a dramatic shift from terrible
drought at the beginning of the year to generally abundant precipitation that was accompanied by destructive
flooding throughout the region. Although the March–May
long rains (Figure 6.3) brought above-normal rainfall to
parts of Kenya and southern Somalia, areas of northern
United Republic of Tanzania, and portions of northern
Kenya, southern and eastern Ethiopia, and central Somalia
continued to experience precipitation deficits. However,
the October–December short rains (Figure 6.4) produced
above-normal rainfall throughout the region.
(i)

Southern sector

By the early months of 2006, below-normal rainfall in the
United Republic of Tanzania during the previous year was
causing significant food security and power supply problems. Approximately two-thirds of the country’s electrical
power is produced by hydropower. By February 2006,
water levels in the hydropower reservoirs were nearly
too low to continue producing electricity. After extremely
dry conditions in January, rain finally began falling somewhat consistently in February and March in central and
southern parts of the country, which constituted a delay
of several weeks for the start of the rainy season there.
In the final quarter of 2006, some signifi cant early
rainy season precipitation fell in October and November
in central and southern United Republic of Tanzania,
and rainfall in December was well above average
throughout the country. The heavy rains caused
flooding in the regions of Shinyanga and Kigoma in
northwestern parts. The paths of Tropical Storm Anita

and Cyclone Bondo brought them into the northern
end of the Mozambique Channel during December,
providing an additional source of moisture and rainfall,
though neither made landfall on the continent.
(ii)

Equatorial sector

The extreme drought in East Africa, which became very
severe by early 2006 with the nearly complete failure
of the October–December 2005 short rains (Oludhe et
al. 2006), was centered on the border region of northeastern Kenya, southeastern Ethiopia, and southern
Somalia. Accumulated precipitation anomalies over
the March–May 2006 long-rains season show near- to
above-normal precipitation throughout much of Kenya,
far southern Somalia, northeastern Uganda, and parts
of southern Ethiopia. Below-normal precipitation is
indicated in parts of north-central Kenya, southern
Uganda, north-central United Republic of Tanzania,
eastern Ethiopia, and large parts of central and southern
Somalia. Precipitation during the March–May long rains
was only about 40%–70% of normal in these areas of
Somalia (and in the neighbouring Somali region of
eastern Ethiopia, and parts of northern Kenya).
(iii)

Northern sector

Rainfall in the highlands of central and western Ethiopia,
much of Sudan, and western Eritrea started earlier
than normal and remained plentiful throughout the
June–September rainy season. In many areas of the
northern sector, precipitation was more than 200% of
normal. Heavy rainfall in July and August throughout

from the 1971–2000 mean were generally found along
or just north of the Atlas Mountains across northern
Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia. Temperatures were
generally cooler than normal in January and February
2006. Above-average temperatures returned to the
region during March–May, but moderated somewhat
during the course of the boreal summer through
September. Above-normal temperatures again dominated in October and November.

COUNTRY SPOTLIGHT: MOROCCO
During early 2006, Morocco recorded wet
conditions with an average monthly rainfall
much greater than the monthly long-term
mean. Winter storm systems occurred
during January and February, generating
cold-air intrusion from the north and caused
heavy rainfall that exceeded the monthly
mean by more than 100%. For example,
Rabat City recorded 173 mm during January,
whereas the 1971–2000 monthly mean is
only 82 mm. Several heat wave events
occurred in late spring and during summer,
punctuated by a +3°C temperature anomaly
for the month of May in many parts of
Morocco (Figure 6.5). In addition, 2006 saw
many Moroccan stations break wind speed
records in summer, surpassing 100 km h –1
in some instances.

Precipitation

The Mediterranean and Atlantic coastal area of North
Africa receives the majority of its precipitation during
October–April, largely from midlatitude cyclones and
associated cold fronts. Mean annual rainfall totals
decreased rapidly from about 700 mm at stations
along the Mediterranean coast of Algeria and Tunisia
to nearly zero in the interior of the Sahara Desert. In
the Atlas Mountains of northern Morocco, Algeria,
and Tunisia, cold-frontal passages can bring subfreezing temperatures and heavy rain or snow, occasionally
causing floods and landslides.
For the year, annual precipitation amounts were above
the 1971–2000 normal in a band extending just south
of the Atlas Mountains from western Algeria northeastward into Tunisia, and at some locations along

and Algeria. Annual totals were generally below normal in Egypt, in interior Algeria, and in the Atlas
Mountains of northern Algeria. Precipitation anomalies
for the October 2005–April 2006 rainy season were
above normal throughout the Canary Islands, Morocco,
northern Algeria, northern Tunisia, and northwestern
Libyan Arab Jamahirya. They were below normal in
central Algeria, northwestern Libyan Arab Jamahirya,
and northern Egypt (Figure 6.6). After generally nearnormal precipitation during October–December 2005,
several extratropical cyclones brought abundant rainfall
to most of North Africa during the first two months
of 2006. However, the months of March and April were
quite dry throughout the region, particularly in northern Algeria and Tunisia. To start the 2006/07 boreal
winter rainy season, precipitation deficits affected
northern Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia in October
and November. Above-normal precipitation returned
to northern Algeria and Tunisia in December.
(iii)

Notable events

During 7–13 February, a slowly propagating extratropical cyclone tracked eastward across the Canary
Islands and Morocco, and into western Algeria,
producing unusually heavy rainfall and destructive
flooding. The heavy rains at Las Palmas/Gando
Station on the Canary Islands contributed signifi cantly to an October 2005–April 2006 precipitation
total that was approximately 200% of the median
for the rainy season. The storm also contributed
heavily to a February 2006 total of 81 mm of precipitation at Tindouf Station in western Algeria;

SOUTHERN AFRICA A. KRUGER, W. LANDMAN, and
W. THIAW

(i)

Temperature

Annual mean temperatures over southern Africa
were generally very close to the 1971–2000 mean in
the southern parts, but about 0.5°–1.0°C above the
1979–2000 average in the north. In an area in the
northern part of Madagascar, temperatures were
between 1° and 2°C above normal (Figure 6.2). The
near-normal temperature conditions in the southern
parts is reflected by the mean temperature anomalies
of 28 South African climate stations, which show
that temperatures in South Africa were about 0.27°C
above the 1961–90 mean, making 2006 only the 15th
warmest year since 1961.
(ii)

Precipitation

Overall, southern Africa received mostly normal to
above-normal rainfall during 2006. The Namibian
northern coastal area and adjacent interior experienced very high rainfall, which is very uncharacteristic
of the region. In contrast, below-normal rainfall was
experienced in central Mozambique and central and
southern Madagascar, where it was very dry in the
east (Figure 6.1).
The rainy season for most of southern Africa extends
from October to April, with most rainfall usually from
December to March. ENSO plays a significant role in
the variability of rainfall, and for the most part causes
drier conditions during warm episodes and wetter
conditions during cold episodes. In the 2006 latesummer rainfall season, SSTs in the Niño-3.4 region
were on average about –0.7°C below normal (base
period 1971–2000), probably playing a role in the
above-normal rainfall experienced over most of southern Africa during late summer.
A surface trough got established over southern Angola,
Namibia, and South Africa. Associated with this system, upper-air (500 hPa) cyclonic circulation resulted
in high rainfall totals during the austral summer and
autumn over the southern parts, including South
Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Angola. Such wet

conditions may have been associated with the La Niña
conditions observed during early 2006. Well-established cloud bands were reported, contributing to
large rainfall anomalies, particularly over Namibia.
Easterly waves contributed to rainfall over the eastern
regions including Kenya, United Republic of Tanzania,
Mozambique, and parts of South Africa. In late autumn,
the surface circulation became anticyclonic, but with
some frontal activity that contributed to anomalously
wet conditions over parts of South Africa, including
regions that are predominantly summer rainfall areas.
During austral spring (SON), surface and associated
upper-air trough systems developed once again over
the west, leading to wet conditions over large areas
of the region. However, these systems weakened during the month of December in association with the

In the southern par t of Mozambique,
the average monthly rainfall ranges from
23 mm in August to 152 mm in January. The
annual average rainfall is about 857 mm.
The monthly normal average air temperature ranges from 18.7°C in July to 26.3°C
in February, with an annual average air
temperature of 23.0°C. In 2006, the minimum monthly rainfall was observed in July
(14.4 mm) and the maximum in March
( 2 8 9.0 mm), with an annual total of
10 6 7.1 m m ( 2 4 . 5% a b o v e n o r m a l ).
Concerning the average air temperature,
the smallest monthly average was 20.1°C in
July and the largest was 27.8°C in February.
The annual average value was 23.8°C, corresponding to 0.8°C above normal.
In central Mozambique, the monthly mean
rainfall varies from 16 mm in September to
221 mm in February, with average annual
rainfall of about 1191 mm (Figure 6.8). The
monthly average air temperature ranges
from 20.2°C in July to 27.0°C in January;

Circulation

The low-level atmospheric circulation associated with
the 2005/06 rainy season featured easterly winds that
averaged about 4–8 m s –1 from the east-central Indian
Ocean westward into Madagascar and portions of
interior southern Africa. This easterly flow was found
along the equatorward flank of an enhanced Mascarene
high pressure system and converged over interior
southern Africa with a northeasterly flow that
originated from the Bay of Bengal. The 500-hPa
geopotential height exhibited strong intraseasonal

the annual average air temperature is
24.4°C. In the case of 2006, the minimum monthly rainfall was observed in
July (5.4 mm) and the maximum in
March (322.7 mm), with an annual value
of 919.5 mm (22.8% below normal).
With regard to the average air temperature, the monthly minimum value was
registered as 21.1°C in July and the
maximum was 29.2°C in December.
The annual average value of 25.4°C corresponds to 1.0°C above normal.

For 2006, the smallest monthly rainfall
was observed in September (2.4 mm),
while the maximum was repor ted in
March (259.9 mm). The annual total was
1122.3 mm (10.4% above normal). The coldest (warmest) monthly average temperature
was registered as 20.8°C (28.0) in July
(November). The annual average temperature was 24.5°C (2.0°C above normal).
Figure 6.7 depicts the temporal distribution of monthly total rainfall and average
air temperature for year 2006, as well as
for the normal period (1961–90). In 2006,
the weather was strongly influenced by
the ITCZ during summer in the center and
north. In the south, cold fronts played a
dominant role. The southern and central
parts of Mozambique were affected by
a tropical depression in January, and by
Tropical Cyclone Boloetse in February.

In northern Mozambique, the monthly
mean rainfall ranges from 4 mm in
September to 196 mm in January; the
annual average rainfall is about 1017
mm. The normal monthly average air
temperature ranges from 19.4°C in
July to 24.4°C in November; the annual
average air temperature is 22.5°C.

Total rainfall (mm)

Mozambique is situated on the southern
part of the East African coast, generally
between 10° and 27°S and between 30°
and 41°E. The country has a climate with
tropical characteristics due to its location,
with a hot rainy season generally from
October to April, and a milder dry season
from May to September.

variability in the circulation, but the presence of an
anomalous trough was evident throughout the season.
This anomalous trough was associated with a weak
low-level anomalous cyclonic circulation across
southern Africa and favored the intrusion of midlatitude
disturbances. These contributed to higher-than-normal
rainfall activity across southern Africa.

WESTERN AFRICA W. THIAW

Precipitation

The 2006 rainy season once again featured abovenormal rainfall across most of the Sahel (Figure 6.8).
Rainfall totals were slightly less than those in 2005,
but exceeded 100 mm above the average over portions of southwestern Senegal, southern and northern
Burkina Faso, southern Niger, and central Chad.
Overall, the 2006 rainy season was the fourth wettest
since 1968. However, despite the wet conditions, the
rainfall season was marked by a late onset. As of
July, most areas in central Senegal, southern
Mauritania, western Mali, and Niger reported rainfall
deficits with amounts only 50%–70% of the long-term
climatological mean. An abrupt northward jump of
the ITCZ in mid-July marked the onset of the rains
in most areas in the Sahel. As of August 2006, cumulative rainfall totals were near or above average across
many areas in the Sahel. In the west, the formation
of tropical depressions (some of them later developed
into Atlantic tropical storms and hurricanes) along
the coastlines of southern Senegal and Guinea,
resulted in strong rainfall anomalies exceeding
200 mm. In contrast, seasonal rainfall totals across
most of the Gulf of Guinea region were below normal.
Rainfall deficits ranged between 100 and 300 mm
across the central and southern areas of Benin, Togo,
Ghana, most of the Côte d’Ivoire, and the eastern
half of Guinea. The exceptions were the northern and
southeastern areas of Nigeria, Liberia, and Sierra
Leone, where rainfall totals exceeded 900 mm.
(ii)

Atmospheric circulation

The above-average 2006 rainy season resulted from
an enhanced West African monsoon in the latter part
of the season. In August–September 2006, strong
southwesterly winds at 925 hPa averaging 3–6 m s –1
extended well northward into the Sahel region. This
enhanced monsoonal inflow was also evident at

850 hPa with Atlantic westerly wind anomalies
exceeding 3 m s –1, contributing to a deep penetration
of moist, unstable air well into the Sahel region. The
enhanced monsoon was also associated with an
anomalous low-level cyclonic circulation across the
northern and central Sahel, characterized by enhanced
cyclonic shear along the equatorward flank of the
AEJ. The mean position of the AEJ across the western
Sahel was at about 15°N.

CANADA R. WHITEWOOD and D. PHILLIPS

The climate of Canada in 2006 was characterized by
near-record temperatures (Figure 6.9) and near-normal
precipitation relative to the 1951–80 base period
(Figure 6.10). Extreme weather took a toll this year with
several deaths and millions of dollars in property damage. British Columbia suffered the most in 2006, starting
the year with a near-record number of days with precipitation, experiencing drought-like conditions through
the summer, and concluding with some of the most
powerful storms ever to hit the province.

remaining the warmest at 2.5°C above normal—since
reliable nationwide records started in 1948. Most of
Canada had temperatures at least 2°C above normal,
with the northern territories experiencing the greatest
anomaly of about 4°C. Only an area in northern British
Columbia had near-normal temperatures. This marks
the 10th straight year of above-normal temperatures,
with 6 of the warmest 10 years occurring in the last
10 years. Over the period of record (1948–2006) the
national trend is +1.3°C.

This is in sharp contrast to 2005, which was the wettest
on record, 13.4% above normal. Wetter areas of the
country, those with more than 20% above normal,
include the Arctic Islands, southwest British Columbia,
central Saskatchewan, northern Manitoba and Quebec,
and southern Ontario. Drier areas, those more than
20% below normal, include the western edge of the
Northwest Territories, northern British Columbia, a few
areas throughout Alberta, southern Manitoba, and
northwest Ontario. One climate region, southern Ontario
and Quebec, experienced its second wettest year (17.6%
above normal); no climate region ranked among its
10 driest years. The southern prairies provinces experienced the driest value, –5.8% (22nd driest).

Nine of the eleven Canadian climate regions had temperatures that ranked among the 10 warmest, with
three climate regions having their warmest year: two
covering Nunavut (+3.4° and +2.3°C), and one covering
northern Ontario and Quebec (+2.3°C). Three other
regions experienced their second warmest year: the
region covering much of the Northwest Territories
(+3.2°C), Atlantic Canada (+1.8°C), and southern Ontario
and Quebec (+1.8°C). Over the 59 years of record, all
the climate regions show a positive trend, with the
region covering much of the Northwest Territories
showing the largest trend of +2.2°C, and the Atlantic
Canada region the smallest trend of +0.3°C.
(ii)

Precipitation

Nationally, 2006 was unremarkable with regard to
precipitation totals, ranking 21st wettest, out of 59 years
of nationwide records, 2.2% above the 1951–80 normal.

(iii)

Notable events

Vancouver, British Columbia, set a couple of records
in January: the most rainfall for the month (283.6 mm,
the normal is 154 mm) and the most number of days
with rain (29). The warm season had the opposite
effect, with a dearth of rain across much of Vancouver
Island. The resort town of Tofino, on the west coast
of the island and normally one of the wettest spots in
Canada, received no significant rain between 14 July
and 16 September. Consequently, the town’s reservoir
fell to record-low levels. November brought three
notable storms to British Columbia’s coast. The first,
on 5 and 6 November, brought intense rains, at times
10–15 mm of rain an hour for 15 hours. A storm on

Overview

Reliable monthly, seasonal, and annual weather
records for the United States exist since 1895, enabling
the climate of 2006 to be placed in a 112-year context.
The nationally averaged temperature for 2006 was
12.72°C, ranking this year as the second warmest on
record. The 2006 annual average temperature was
only 0.04°C cooler than the record that occurred in

15 November brought heavy rains to the Vancouver
area, causing so much turbidity in the drinking water
that an estimated two million people were advised to
boil their tapwater before drinking. Then, on
25 November, a storm brought 40 cm of snow to
Vancouver and Victoria, the amount they normally
receive in a year. Three wind storms (greater than
100 km h –1), all aimed at Vancouver Island and the
lower mainland, were the hallmark of December.

Figure 6.12. Annual temperature (°F and °C) averaged across
the contiguous United States from 1895 to 2006

1998, and ~0.01°C warmer than 1934, making these
three years nearly identical in rank (Figure 6.12). These
rankings are based on version 2 of the US Historical
Climatology Network. Note that ties are not indicated
in figures; ties are labeled as duplicates of the more
extreme ranking (e.g., a tie for ranking two and three
is listed as two for both).
Nationally, annual precipitation was near the longterm mean, giving 2006 a rank of 55th driest year in
the 112-year record. Considerable variability in precipitation occurred across the country and throughout
the year. Florida had the driest March–December
season on record in 2006, while Indiana ranked as
the wettest on record for the same season. Significant
drought expanded during the first half of the year,
affecting ~52% of the country at its peak in July. The
dry conditions were accompanied by a record wildfire
season, with almost 10 million acres (~4 million ha)
burned during 2006.
(ii)

Temperature

For the contiguous United States, 2006 marked the
ninth consecutive year with temperatures much warmer
than the long-term average (Figure 6.12). The past nine
years have all been among the 25th warmest years on
record, a streak that is unprecedented in the historical
record. The long-term warming trend for annual
temperatures is approximately 0.56°C (1.0°F) warmer
than at the start of the twentieth century. National
temperatures persisted at warm or record warm levels
throughout 2006 with only two months (September
and October) that were cool exceptions.
The 2005/06 winter season (December–February)
temperatures were above average across most of the
nation with near-average temperatures limited to parts
of the Northwest and Southeast and no state ranking
below average. The warmer-than-average winter season was due in part to record-warm temperatures that

84
StateoftheClimate_2006.indd 84

2/22/08 11:21:00 AM

affected the nation in January. The nationally averaged
temperature for January 2006 was 3.9°C, which is 1°C
warmer than the previous January record set in 1953.
All states within the contiguous United States were
warmer than average during January, with 13 states,
mostly located in the central and northern plains and
Great Lakes, ranking as their record warmest.
Cold-air outbreaks affected the western states during
March and the Southeast during May, but warm
temperatures dominated the nation during the 2006
spring season (March–May). Much warmer-thanaverage temperatures affected most of the central
states, with Texas and Oklahoma having the warmest
spring on record. April ranked second warmest in the
1895–present record for the nation, with an average
temperature of 13.4°C.
The summer (June–August) months were characterized
by an intense and long-lasting heat wave that began
in mid-July in the northern plains and upper Midwest,
breaking records that stood since the Dust Bowl years
in some locations. The heat spread across the plains
and moved into the West before returning to the northern plains by late July, then spreading to the East Coast
by the first week of August. More than 2,300 daily
temperature records were broken in the United States
during the last two weeks of July and several more
during the first half of August; more than 50 records
for the highest temperatures in any July were established. Many locations from the West Coast to the
central plains broke records for the most days above
32.2° (90°F) and 37.8°C (100°F). The month of July 2006
ranked as the second hottest month ever in the 112-year
record, with a nationally averaged temperature of 25.1°C,
only 0.24°C cooler than the record-hottest month—July
1936. Nationally averaged temperatures gave summer
2006 a rank of second warmest on record just behind
1934 (second warmest) and 1936 (warmest).
The persistent widespread warmth for much of the year
resulted in the warmest January–August period on
record. Colder weather during September and October
brought a brief respite before unusual warmth returned
to much of the country during November and December.
December 2006 ranked fourth warmest on record.
For the year as a whole, New Jersey, Vermont,
Oklahoma, and Texas were second warmest on record
(Figure 6.13a). Another 13 states had one of their

top-five warmest years. All of the 48 contiguous states
were either record warmest, warmer, or much warmer
than average. No state ranked near or below average
during 2006. This contrasts with the spatial pattern
during the warmest and third warmest years, 1998
and 1934, when at least one state ranked colder than
average for the year (Figures. 6.13b,c). The 2006 annual
temperature for Alaska ranked near the 1918–2006
average, breaking a string of persistently warm years
dating back to 2000. Winter temperatures in 2006 were
above average for the seventh consecutive year. Both
spring and summer were slightly cooler than average
and fall was slightly warmer.
(iii)

Precipitation and drought

Precipitation in the contiguous United States during 2006
was variable throughout much of the country, with periods
of excessive rainfall, especially across the Northwest,
Great Lakes, and Northeast, and persistent and developing drought in other areas. Winter storms in the Northwest
contributed to the ranking of 10th wettest winter for the
region. The Southwest had its second driest winter, with
Arizona and New Mexico having their driest winters on
record. Precipitation averaged across the nation was
below average during spring. Regionally, the Southeast
had the third driest spring, whereas the West ranked as
the sixth wettest. The Northeast had its wettest summer,
exceeding the previous record by more than 25.4 mm
(1 in.), while the region consisting of the Northern Great
Plains and northern Rockies states had its ninth driest
summer. Three states (New Hampshire, New York, and
Rhode Island) had the wettest summer on record. Fall
was generally wet across the contiguous United States,
resulting in a rank of 15th wettest for the nation. Regionally,
the Northwest and Northeast ranked as having the 10th
and 4th wettest autumn periods, respectively.
Five of the first seven months of the year were drier than
average for the contiguous United States as a whole.
Combined with unusually warm temperatures, this
exacerbated drought across much of the country. By
late July, half of the contiguous United States was in
moderate to exceptional drought. Annual precipitation
ranks ranged from third driest in Florida and fifth driest
in Wyoming and Georgia, to second wettest in New
Hampshire and third wettest in Indiana. The Northeast
had another wet year, ranking sixth wettest in 2006 and
marking the fifth consecutive year with above-average
precipitation. In fact, the top two wettest annual periods

in New Hampshire occurred during the past two years.
Nationally, annual precipitation was near the long-term
mean, ranking as the 55th driest year on record.
The year began drier than average across a broad
swath of the country from the Southwest to the Great
Plains, across much of the Gulf Coast, and into the
coastal Southeast. Above-average precipitation continued to erode the drought areas in the Pacific
Northwest. This pattern continued throughout the
spring and into the summer (Figure 6.14). By fall,
drought was concentrated in the plains, especially in
Texas and Oklahoma. By the end of the year, drought
subsided in much of the Southeast, but was prominent
across parts of the plains.
Several short-lived dry episodes occurred in other
regions throughout the year, notably in the mid-Atlantic
in February and March, the Northeast coast in March,
the Pacific Northwest in July and August, and Florida
for much of the year. The percent area of the contiguous United States experiencing moderate to extreme
drought (as defined by the Palmer Drought Index) grew
steadily from 20% in January, to a peak of about 52%
by July, and then declined during the second half of
the year. Impacts from the 2006 droughts were felt
especially hard by the agricultural and hydrological
communities. The South Platte River was nearly dry
during the summer, low water levels in the Mississippi
and Missouri Rivers forced an early end to barge
transportation, several municipalities imposed water
use restrictions, livestock was prematurely sold, and
crops died before harvest. In some areas, such as in
South Dakota and Nebraska, recovery of grazing lands
from drought is not expected for at least two years.
(iv)

Snowpack

The 2005/06 snow season was generally above average
across parts of the Northwest and below average across
the Southwest. The snow cover extent was below average for the North American continent as a whole during
the winter season, in which January 2006 had the second lowest snow cover extent behind 1981, as well as
during the spring season. This is consistent with a trend
toward reduced spring snow cover for North America
since 1986. By the end of the spring season, snowpack
was above average across the western mountains from
the Sierra Nevada in California to the Washington
Cascades, and into the interior Northwest.

the month of February that affected areas of the MidAtlantic and the Northeast on 11–12 February. This
storm produced 68.3 cm (26.9 in.) of snow in New York
City’s Central Park. This amount broke the all-time storm
total record of 67.1 cm (26.4 in.) set during the
26–27 December 1947 storm. The NESIS classified the
February blizzard as a category 3 (major) storm and
ranked it as the 20th most intense on record for the
Northeast. In Hartford, Connecticut, a snowfall total of
55.6 cm (21.9 in.) broke the old storm total record of
53.3 cm (21 in.), set in 1983. Many locations in the region
reported 25–51 cm (10–20 in.) during this event.
An active Pacific storm track during the winter and
spring brought a steady supply of snow to the West,
Northwest, and Intermountain West. On the other
hand, snowfall across Arizona and New Mexico was
exceptionally low throughout the season, with most
basins reporting less than 40% of normal snowpack
at the end of spring.
The 2006/07 snow season started with above-average
snowfall across parts of the West. Snowfall accumulations of up to 60 cm (2 ft) fell across the Cascades in
late November. During December 2006, two major
winter snow storms impacted Colorado and parts of
the High Plains. Denver, Colorado, had its third snowiest December on record and endured a major blizzard,
which brought the city to a standstill during the holiday
travel season. Snowfall in excess of 90 cm (3 ft) fell
across portions of the Colorado Front Range and
western High Plains during these two events.

Wildfires

Continuing a pattern of increased large fire activity
that extends back to the early 1990s, wildland fires

reached record levels in 2006. According to the NIFC,
preliminary estimates of the area burned exceeded
9.8 million acres (~4 million ha) across the United
States this past year. In contrast to the total acreage
burned, the annual number of wildfires has decreased
steadily since the 1980s; over 96,000 fires were
reported in 2006, which was the sixth consecutive
year that the annual number of fires for the entire
United States has been below 100,000. As discussed
by Westerling et al. (2006), there has been an increasing trend of larger wildfires across the West, where
the inverse relationship between increasing area
burned and decreasing number of fires has been the
most pronounced.
There were several notable aspects to the record fire
season in 2006, in terms of its timing and severity.
Wildfires that initially began across the southern
plains in December 2005 persisted into early 2006.
Below-normal precipitation and extreme drought
conditions aided in the development of numerous
wildfires across Oklahoma, Texas, and Arkansas, with
over 1.5 million acres (~600,000 ha) burned over the
first three months of the year in the southern area
(which encompasses 13 states, Puerto Rico, the Virgin
Islands, and the District of Columbia). During the
spring, fire activity spread to the Southwest, with
the most severe activity concentrated in New Mexico
and southern California. By summer, wildfires had
spread into the Great Basin and Pacific Northwest,
with large fires affecting most of the West by the end
of July. Large fire activity spread northward, because
the Pacific Northwest was the focal area in August
and early September, while during the fall, activity
shifted again into southern California.
(vi)

Severe extratropical storms

Several severe extratropical cyclones affected the
United States in 2006. The first of these occurred early
in the year on 18 January, when a powerful winter
storm brought heavy rainfall, strong winds, and heavy
snowfall to sections of the East Coast. During the
spring peak in severe weather, several tornado
outbreaks occurred in the southern plains, as well as
the Tennessee and Ohio valleys, which produced over
500 tornadoes and nearly 50 fatalities during March
and April combined. Northwestern Tennessee was
the hardest hit region, with 23 fatalities attributed to
the storms. According to preliminary statistics compiled

by NOAA’s Storm Prediction Center, there were
1333 tornadoes reported across the United States in
2006, with April having the most of any month (324).
The most severe day of the year was 12 March when
142 tornadoes were reported.
Two large extratropical storms of note occurred toward
the end of 2006. On 21–22 November, a strong extratropical cyclone developed off the southeastern coast
of the United States, producing a variety of severe
weather events in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic.
Heavy rainfall and strong winds were reported along
the coastline from South Carolina northward through
Virginia. Winds gusting over 115 km h–1 (70 mph) were
reported along the coast of North Carolina. On
13–15 December, a powerful storm system came
ashore along the Pacific Northwest coast and generated strong winds, heavy rainfall, and high-elevation
snows. Wind gusts reaching hurricane force caused
power outages across Washington and Oregon.

MEXICO V. DAVYDOVA BELITSKAYA and A. DOUGLAS

Mexico was on average 5% wetter than normal in 2006,
with much warmer than normal temperatures. Mexico’s
SMN reported a national precipitation average of
808 mm, compared with an historical average of
771 mm (1941–2000). The nationwide annual mean
temperature was 21.9°C, which was a 1.2°C above the
long-term climate average. However, it should be noted
that most of the stations used to create the nationwide
temperature values are in large urban centers. In light
of inherent heat island biases in the underlying data,
which are currently unaccounted for, care should be
taken in interpreting the 1.2°C climate anomaly.
The rainfall distribution was not homogeneous
throughout the year or across large sections of the
country. The year started abnormally dry but it quickly
recovered with a good rainy season from May to
October (total rain or warm-season precipitation was
111% of normal according to the SMN; see Figure 6.15).
The summer of 2006 was typified by widespread and
consistent monsoon rainfall through much of the
country; this helped to raise reservoir levels throughout the western states following a long series of dry
winters in that region.
Some states reported major rainfall deficits for the
year. These include Baja California (46% below the

long-term mean), San Luis Potosí (25% below), México
and Yucatan (19% below), Oaxaca and Sonora (16%
below), Hidalgo (15% below), Zacatecas and Tamaulipas
(12% below), Quintana Roo (10% below), and Sinaloa
(7% below). The deficits in the northwest were associated with a poor winter rainy season in early 2006
and again in late 2006. The development of El Niño
conditions during the later half of the year was associated with four east Pacific tropical storms that
recurved toward the west coast of Mexico: John,
Lane, Norman, and Paul. In contrast, there were no
landfalling tropical storms on the east coast of Mexico;
this helped to contribute to the observed dryness in
the Yucatan Peninsula and northeast Mexico.
Despite the very warm annual mean temperature; a
notable cold outbreak occurred in northern Mexico
on 17 January when Temosachic and La Rosilla recorded
–15°C, Yecora recorded –10°C, Pabillon recorded –7°C,
and Saltillo recorded –4.5°C. An exceptionally early
winter cold outbreak occurred in the northwest on
1 December, with La Rosilla falling to –13.5°C and
Temosachic to –12°C. One of the most significant and
highly unusual meteorological events occurred during
the last week of the year in the states of Chihuahua
and Durango when very heavy snows covered the
western section of the these two states, with mountainous areas exceeding well over 10 in. of snow.

Most of the Central American isthmus and the
Caribbean experienced drier-than-normal conditions
in 2006 (Figure 6.16). Precipitation deficits were severe
and more persistent over what is known as the “dry

central Honduras, northern and central Nicaragua,
and western El Salvador). August had the highest

precipitation defi cits compared to the 1971–2000
period. Precipitation deficits continued during
September and October along the dry corridor. In
parts of Nicaragua and Honduras, deficits between
35% and 55% of the long-term mean were observed
in September and October. October is when most
tropical cyclones form close to Central America,
generating very intense rains or “temporales” on
the Pacific side of the isthmus. The temporales were
lacking in autumn 2006, because El Niño conditions
were observed in the tropical Pacific. In November,
the Caribbean side of Central America was affected
by a cold front that brought strong rains to the northern Honduras coast and central Panama. Late-year
rains, associated with the divergent phase of the
MJO, were observed on the Pacific side of Central
America through the middle of December.

in Belize, western Guatemala and Honduras, and western Panama. At the same time, positive anomalies were
registered in Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Positive anomalies dominated along the whole region from May to
October. The warmest conditions, relative to climatology, were observed in July and August, when monthly
departures from the 1971–2000 mean exceeded 0.5°C.
In November, mean temperatures in northern Central
America (northern Guatemala and Belize) showed
negative anomalies. In the southern extreme of the
Central American isthmus (eastern Panama), temperatures remained above normal. The whole region showed
positive anomalies once again in December.

TEMPERATURE

Annual mean surface temperature in 2006 was above
normal across much of Central America and parts of
the Caribbean (Figure 6.17). Positive anomalies of
between 0.3° and 0.4°C were found over Central America
(south and west of Honduras and El Salvador, Nicaragua,
and northern Costa Rica), and were near normal across
Panama. Temperatures that were near normal predominated the first two months of the year. In March,
resulting from a late intrusion of cold fronts into the
region, below-normal monthly means were observed

3)

NOTABLE EVENTS

In 2006, the reduced hurricane activity in the Caribbean
(consistent with the development of a weak El Niño
event) spared Central America from heavy rainy events,
creating a stark contrast between 2006 and 2005, when
tropical cyclones had a significant impact on the region.
Also consistent with El Niño, Central America experienced drier-than-normal conditions in the latter half
of 2006. Cold surges in November impacted the region
with low temperatures in the north and stronger-thannormal winds and rainfall in southern Costa Rica and
Panama. The surges caused significant damage to
vegetable crops in the Guatemala Plateau. Along with
high humidity values, heavy flooding events produced
floods in the Caribbean plains of Honduras and central

SOUTH AMERICA

1)

OVERVIEW M. RUSTICUCCI and J. L. CAMACHO

The overall weather in South America in 2006 was very
dry or wet in parts (Figure 6.19), but largely warmerthan-normal (Figure 6.20). La Niña conditions prevailed
in the central equatorial Pacific for a few months at the
start of the year. A weak-to-moderate El Niño event
developed by the middle of the year; it reached its
maximum strength by late November. Modulation by
the MJO also played a role. Some extreme rainfall
events occurred in Colombia and Ecuador. In July–
August, ENSO shifted to the warm phase. In the second
part of the year, some classical teleconnections were

COUNTRY SPOTLIGHT: CUBA

active, especially in central or Atlantic areas. Most
notably, there were no reports of hurricane activity in
the north. However, the teleconnections over the Pacific
side were less clear and the ITCZ in the eastern Pacific
was not as intense as expected.
For temperature, the most important feature was the
overall positive anomaly. Consistent with the overall
warming pattern since 1950 (Figure 6.21), 2005 and 2006
were warmer than average, though not reaching the
peak of 1998. Some areas of Brazil experienced recordbreaking temperatures in austral summer, for example,
the 44.6°C record for Bom Jesus on 31 January. A belt
from northern Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, and southern Brazil showed a marked warm anomaly in July. In
contrast, fall (April–May) was cold in the tropical Andes
and in southern areas due to marked cold-air advection.
Extreme temperature variability on weekly or monthly
time periods was noteworthy in Brazil.

A. M. CARRIÓN ROMERO, M. HERNÁNDEZ SOUZA, and D. BOUDET ROCO
The Cuban climate in 2006 was affected by
the weak El Niño, primarily from September
through December. Precipitation was lower
than normal in September and October. In
November and December, precipitation
was above normal as cold fronts reached
the Caribbean, and the subtropical jet was
southeast of its usual position (consistent
with El Niño). December was a particularly
warm month across Cuba.
The year 2006 as a whole was very warm
(11th warmest since 1951), with an average temperature of 25. 8 5° C, 0. 3 6 ° C
above normal (Figure 6.18). January and
December contributed most to the warm
anomaly. Januar y, the coldest month,
brought positive anomalies of 0.5°–1°C
across Cuba, whereas December was the
second warmest since 1951 (just behind
1986). Many Cuban stations broke maximum or minimum temperature records in
2006, especially during a cold outbreak in
late November.
Rainfall deficits affected parts of western
and central Cuba. Eastern parts received
abundant rainfall, including Holguín and
Guantánamo (comparing against the

1971–90 normal). Tropical Cyclones Alberto
and Ernesto both impacted Cuba. In June,
Alberto brought intense rains to western
Cuba, especially in Pinar del Río and Isla
de la Juventud.In August, Ernesto brought

torrential rains to central and eastern Cuba.
Despite these two storms, the 2006 hurricane season was relatively quiet for
Cuba, considering the activity witnessed
this decade.

Rainfall anomalies were highly variable across the
region. The Andean territory of Colombia and
Venezuela was in general above average. Neighboring
areas of Orinoco and Amazonian basins were below
average. There was yet another year of drought, adding to the long-term event that southern Brazil,
Uruguay, and parts of Argentina have been enduring.
Much of southern Peru, a relatively arid zone, had
rainfall clearly above normal. South-central Chile
(near 40°S), the rainiest area in the country, received
more rain than normal, as did Patagonia. A combination of extreme events and passage of fronts more
frequent than normal in the second half of the year
could explain this fact.

NORTHERN SOUTH AMERICA AND THE SOUTHERN
CARIBBEAN J. D. PABÓN, G. HURTADO, and M. HENRIQUEZ

During the first half of 2006, the climate over northern
South America was influenced by La Niña conditions.
Precipitation was above normal over Caribbean and
Andean sectors of Colombian territory and western
Venezuela. In May–June, these conditions were accentuated by the effects of a strong convective phase of
the MJO. Consequently, heavy rainfall events produced landslides, flash floods in mountain regions,

10N

and lowland fl oods, killing over 100 and affecting
over 100,000.
Monthly mean air temperature during the first six
months in the region was between near normal and
slightly below normal, with the exception of February
when isolated regions recorded slight positive anomalies.
Negative anomalies of monthly precipitation dominated
over the region from July to October. The rainfall deficit
was strong in September–October thanks in part to a
subsidence phase of the MJO (Figure 6.22). A very
strong convective phase of the MJO was observed in
November over northern South America; this phase
reactivated rainfall over the region and above-normal
precipitation was reported for November–December.
In the period from July to September, monthly mean
air temperatures were near to below normal. In
October, some sectors recorded slight positive air
temperature anomalies, and during November–
December, consistent with El Niño, positive anomalies
dominated the region. As in the tropical Atlantic, the
tropical cyclone season in the Caribbean Sea was
not active. Only some tropical waves (easterly waves)
observed over the Caribbean Sea influenced the
weather of the Caribbean sector of this region.

TROPICAL ANDEAN REGION E. JAIMES and R. MARTÍNEZ

During January and February, the South Pacific anticyclone was between normal to slightly more intense. The
frequency of inverted troughs brought warmer conditions to the Peruvian coast. The ITCZ and the ET were
located slightly north of their normal position. However,
the Bolivian high was located to the west of its normal
position, favoring significant rains over the central and
southern mountain regions in Peru and affecting the
mountain region of Bolivia with some scattered rains.
Conversely, the periodic formation of the Atlantic convergence zone contributed frequent rains over the
Amazonian region in Brazil, Bolivia, and Peru. In March,
the formation of a second band of the ITCZ in the eastern
Pacific Ocean was observed, close to 5°S with moderate
activity. The ET formed near 8°S with convective activity
in the Amazonian region of Brazil, causing rains and
storms with an intensity ranging between moderate
and strong. Conversely, some migratory highs caused
instability in the atmosphere, forming convective complexes in the jungles and highlands of Bolivia.
For the April–May period, the South Pacific anticyclone
started to show some intensification, typical of the season; however, a second band of the ITCZ persisted, though
smaller than in March, favoring rains along the Peruvian
coast. In some days in April, migratory highs were generated (up to 1030 hPa) that favored the presence of strong

The South Pacific anticyclone and ITCZ moved to the
north during austral winter, as expected. In July, a
thermal orographic low was observed at 1005 hPa and
contributed to the convergence of humidity and to the
increase of air temperatures in Paraguay, the southern
jungles of Bolivia, and the north and central parts of
Argentina. In August and September, the migratory
highs systems in the continent were very frequent
(though not very intense), keeping the skies clear.
Frosts occurred in many areas located near 2500 m
above sea level in the Amazonian regions of Bolivia,
Peru, and Brazil. In November, there were some circulation patterns considered to be characteristics of
(an early) austral summer, such as the behavior of the
Bolivian high. This caused heavy precipitation over
Huanuco, San Martin, and Ucayali; it later affected
Bolivia with strong winds from the north.

TROPICAL SOUTH AMERICA, EAST OF THE ANDES
J. MARENGO

In general, the most important feature of summer
rainfall for 2006 was the occurrence of rainfall extremes
that produced floods and avalanches, claiming lives
and resulting in huge economic losses. During the
summer of 2006 (December 2005—March 2006), and
following a drought situation that affected southwestern Amazonia during most of 2005 (Marengo
et al. 2007, manuscript submitted to J. Climate), the
Brazilian state of Acre experienced abundant rainfall.
Below-normal precipitation was observed in southeastern South America, featuring a drought situation
in southern Brazil and neighbouring Uruguay, which
has lasted at least 3 years. Changes in Southern
Hemisphere circulation may be the cause of this
extended drought. Meanwhile, most of northern
South America and Bolivia saw above-average
amounts of rainfall. In January, Bolivia was affected
by destructive flooding and landslides.
Intense rainfall during the end of 2005 and beginning
of 2006 caused flooding along rivers and coastal areas
of Guyana, including the capital, Georgetown.

92
StateoftheClimate_2006.indd 92

2/22/08 11:21:13 AM

Thousands of acres of farmland in Barima Waini and
Mahaica Berbice were lost due to flooding. In the state
of Bahia in the southern section of northeast Brazil,
drought affected the agricultural production with
losses of about 30% in corn and 29% in bean production. By the end of summer and the beginning of the
fall season (March–May 2006), abnormally heavy
rainfall of about 200 mm above normal in the Brazilian
state of Para caused flooding along the Tocantins,
Xingu, and Tapajos Rivers, all of which are Amazon
River tributaries. Meanwhile, heavy rainfall triggered
new flooding and landslides in Colombia, particularly
along the Pacific coast and in central sections of the
country during January and February, with values
between 100 and 150 mm month –1 above normal.
Consistent with the weakening of the cold episode in
the Pacific in 2006, northeastern Brazil, northern
Argentina, and southern Peru experienced aboveaverage rainfall, while Uruguay, southeastern Brazil,
and much of Colombia had a deficit of rainfall during
April. The rainy season in northeast Brazil that extends

from February to May was near normal. In July–
September 2006, dry anomalies characterized northern
and southeastern South America, from northern
Colombia to Venezuela, with deficits of about 200 mm
month –1 below normal. September and October featured abundant rainfall (about 200 mm month–1 above
normal) from the transition region between Amazonia
and northeast Brazil, extending up to southeastern
Brazil. The latter region (especially the region off the
coast) experienced above-normal rainfall until
December 2006, due to the penetration of frontal
systems coming from the south.
Most of tropical South America, east of the Andes
experienced a warm 2006, with anomalies between
2° and 3°C warmer than normal, especially during
summer between the Andes and eastern Amazonia.
Temperature records were broken in the austral summer in Brazil. Record highs above 41°C were also
detected in other cities in southern Brazil in January
2006. Associated with the extended drought, these
were among the highest temperatures during the last
40 years. In May, in a notable departure from recent
trends, many Southern Hemisphere land areas saw
temperatures well below average, including much of
western Brazil, and southward to Uruguay, Paraguay,
and northeastern Argentina. During September,
extreme cold weather affected southern Brazil. During
the austral winter season, air temperatures in tropical
South America east of the Andes were very high,
sometimes about 3°C warmer than normal. The city
of São Paulo reached a maximum of 30.2°C on 24 July
(a record for the last 63 years), accentuating the notion
that the Brazilian winter of 2006 was highly irregular,
being warmer than normal in most of Brazil even
though extreme cold days occurred.

Temperature anomalies were positive in 2006 over
most the region. Anomalies between 0.5° and 1.5°C
were observed in northern Argentina, northern Chile,
Paraguay, and northwest Uruguay. The beginning of
2006 was anomalously warm in northwest Argentina
and Chile. In southern Uruguay and the province of
Buenos Aires, mean temperature was slightly below
normal. Autumn in southern South America was characterized by below-normal temperatures along Uruguay
and eastern Argentina (+0.2° to –1.0°C), particularly

93
StateoftheClimate_2006.indd 93

2/22/08 11:21:14 AM

during May, when the negative anomalies extended
into Paraguay, southern Brazil, Bolivia, and the southern
portion of the Amazon basin. The winter season was
warm over the entire region with temperatures from
+1.0° to +2.0°C over the climatological mean. June and
July were exceptionally warm in Paraguay, northern
Argentina, Uruguay, and southeast Brazil. In July, mean
temperature anomalies exceeding +4.0°C were observed
over Paraguay and the surrounding regions, while the
area with anomalies above +2.0°C included most of
the continental territories between 6° and 38°S. The
warm spell ended abruptly by the end of the month
due to a powerful cold-air incursion than also affected
southern and western Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, and southern
Colombia. In Uruguay, the daily mean temperature
dropped around 10°C between 26 and 27 July, while
frost was observed in central Argentina and daily
minimum temperatures below –10°C occurred in the
southern part of the country (Patagonia).
The spring season showed positive anomalies of the
order of +0.5° to +1.0°C. Significant weather events
occurred in Argentina during July. During the first half
of the month, a high pressure system located on the
eastern side of the continent favored the advection of
warm and moist air from the Amazon basin. An extreme
Zonda event occurred between 11 and 12 July, producing significant property damage. At the same time, a
powerful winter storm hit central Chile and caused significant flooding. On 26 July, a warm and wet air mass
affected the central and northern portion of the country,
provoking rain showers and intense thunderstorms.
Across northeast Uruguay and southern Brazil, the
moderate-to-exceptional drought that persisted during
2006 contributed to a record low in the Uruguay River
level. Nevertheless, on 23 March, the most intense
rainfall episode in the last 50 years (232 mm in 24 h)
affected southeast Uruguay and the adjacent territory
in southern Brazil. During another intense rainfall
episode that affected the Uruguayan coast of the La
Plata River on 17 December, 200 mm were measured
at Nueva Palmira during a 24-h period. In contrast, a
seasonal rainfall deficit of about 40% characterized
the eastern Uruguayan territory of the Laguna Merin
basin (along the border with Brazil).
The rainfall regime along the extratropical west coast
of South America is determined by the frequency and
intensity of cold fronts moving eastward in the

southeast Pacific. The year 2006 ended with a rainfall
surplus between 10% and 20% at most of the stations
south of 30°S. However, the rainy season started late
in central Chile (30°–35°S), with a rainfall deficit at the
end of May that was nearly –70%. The anomalously
intense frontal activity in June produced a quick
recovery from the deficit. Very wet conditions continued
during July along the west coast of the continent,
southward from 30°S. A powerful extratropical winter
storm hit the region from 9 to 12 July, producing
landslides, flooding, and damage associated with
strong winds. The 107 mm of rainfall measured at
Concepción (37°S) on 10 July was the second highest
daily rainfall reported at this station since 1950. The
region of Bio-Bio in central Chile (around 37°S) suffered
the greatest damage and was declared a disaster zone.
The passage of this frontal system, with associated
strong westerlies in the middle troposphere, was the
origin of a severe episode of Zonda winds along the
eastern side of the Andes on 11 July. Although August
was relatively dry in central Chile (30°–35°S), an
extraordinary rainfall episode occurred along the
extremely arid region of northern Chile during the
night of 29 August, associated with the arrival of
an extratropical cyclonic disturbance. Precipitation
(7.7 mm at Antofagasta, 23°S) and strong winds
produced considerable damage in urban areas of this
region where it very seldom rains.

NOTABLE EVENTS

(i)

Drought in southern Brazil J. Marengo

Southern Brazil exhibited a regular pattern of precipitation, with maxima in austral spring and autumn. An
analysis of rainfall since January 2003 to June 2006
shows that precipitation was below the climatological
mean during most of the period (especially during
the peak season) with above-normal rainfall outside
the rainy season. During 2004 and the period between
December 2005 and June 2006, rainfall has been
below normal. This drought especially impacted the
hydroelectric sector, with precipitation below 60% of
the long-term mean over the basins of the Uruguay,
Jacui, and Iguaçu Rivers. During the 2006 winter, the
reservoir levels along these basins reached values
lower than 20% of their averages. The drought produced severe impacts in the state of Rio Grande do
Sul in southern Brazil during the first six months of
2006, with losses of 11% and 48% reported for the

94
StateoftheClimate_2006.indd 94

soybean and wheat harvest, respectively. Rainfall
deficits were also observed in neighbouring northern
Uruguay during this time of year. Rainfall in Rivera/
Santana do Livramento, near the Uruguay/Brazil border, was about 60% of the normal. Discharge of the
Uruguay (Figure 6.23) and Negro Rivers reached their
lowest values since 1968, producing shortages in
hydroelectric power in the whole country.
The SPI, as defined by McKee et al. (1993, 1995), quantifies the drought in southern Brazil. The SPI accounts
for the various time scales at play during drought and
subsequent rains. For the last four years, the SPI values
were lower than the moderate (–1.0) to very dry (–1.5)
threshold. The drought situation affecting southern
Brazil is not just the consequence of the rainfall deficit
in 2006, but is due to a rainfall deficit that has accumulated during the last three years.
The causes of this extended drought have been linked
to variability in the regional circulation. Cold fronts
represent the main rainfall-producing mechanisms
in southern Brazil. An assessment of the number of
cold fronts during January 2003–June 2006 affecting
the region shows that this number was below normal.
This behavior is consistent with an increase in the
frequency of blocking systems in southern South
America and a reduction in wavenumber in the higher
latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere.

The Zonda event in Argentina F. Norte, G. Ulke, S.
Simonelli, and M. Viale

Four categories define the strength of the Zonda. The
top two categories, “severe” (Z3) and “extremely
severe” (Z4), respectively, account for less than 8%
of Zonda events (Norte 1988). The event of 11 July
reached categories Z3 and Z4 in the surrounding area
of Mendoza and San Juan, where wind speeds reached
over 120 km h –1 during a 2–3-hour period without
interruption.
The synoptic surface and upper-air conditions were
the typical ones associated with a severe Zonda wind
occurrence: 1) a surface cold front approaching the
central coast of Chile driven by a 500-hPa-level trough,
2) a deep low pressure surface system approximately
over 55°S and 65°W, and 3) a strong upper-level jet
stream. The main feature of the event is the sharp
polar air advection from the south and an intense
meridional 500–1000-hPa thickness gradient. The
occurrence of the Zonda episode was characterized
by a marked increase in temperature and a decrease
in humidity. Thus, in Mendoza, the temperature reached
28.2°C while the dewpoint dropped to –6°C. At San
Juan, the air temperature rose to 33.0°C, and the
dewpoint fell to –15.0°C (Figure 6.24). The Zonda

Temperature (ºC)

The Zonda is a strong, warm, and very dry wind
associated with adiabatic compression upon

descending the eastern slopes of the Andes,
preferentially in winter and spring. It is the Argentine
version of katabatic winds, which are also called
mistral, chinook, Santa Ana, and foehn winds in
different parts of the world. Although this phenomenon
occurs across the entire length of the extratropical
Andes, it is most frequently detected near the cities
of Mendoza (33°S) and San Juan (31.5°S), which are
the most populated cities in western Argentina
(1.5 million inhabitants).

N. N. KORSHUNOVA, and V. N. RAZUVAEV

The year 2006 in the Russian Federation showed nearnormal rainfall (Figure 6.25), while much of the country
was quite warm (Figure 6.26). The anomaly of the
mean annual air temperature averaged over the Russian
territory was 0.5°C. In early 2006, most of the Russian
territory experienced severe frosts. Record-breaking
low mean monthly temperatures were recorded in
western Siberia. In both the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous
Area and the Khanty-Mansisk Autonomous Area, the
minimum air temperature dropped as low as –58°C.
Six meteorological stations in the Tomsk region
recorded temperatures that were 0.1°–0.4°C below the
absolute minimum. Daily anomalies exceeded
–25°C.
In the Kemerovo region, thermometers dropped to
–53°C. In the second and third 10-day periods, recordbreaking anomalies were recorded in the Tomsk and
Kemerovo regions and in the Krasnoyarsk Territory.
This winter, the Siberian anticyclone moved far to
the west of its usual position over Yakutia. The

anticyclone center was over the southern part of the
Krasnoyarsk Territory. Therefore, severe frosts persisted there for a long time. At the station of Bor,
frosts below –30°C lasted 22 days—a new record.
The same pattern was observed in the northern part
of the Tomsk region at Aleksandrovskoe, where
severe frosts persisted for 24 days, with frosts below
–30°C persisting for 23 days.
Record-breaking low minimum air temperatures were
recorded in the second 10-day period of January in
the eastern parts of the central Chernozem region.
By 24 January, severe frosts reached southern regions;
in Krasnodar and Adygeia, the recorded air temperatures were –34° and –29°C, respectively. Even on the
Black Sea coast, in the vicinity of Anapa-Novorossisk,
the air temperature dropped as low as –25°C. The
Astrakhan region (Verkhny Baskunchak) experienced
the record-breaking low minimum air temperature of
–33.3°C. The lowest minimum air temperatures for
the whole period of record were observed in Krasnodar
(–30.6°C) and Stavropol (–24.3°C). On 30 January,
temperatures in Krasnoyarsk dropped to –41.3°C,
dropping below the previous daily record of –40°C.
In some of the settlements in the Krasnoyarsk Territory,
the air temperature dropped as low as –50°C. The
lowest temperature in Russia was registered on
30 January in the Evenki Autonomous Area (–58.5°C
in the Kerbo Settlement). For comparison, in Oimyakon,
the town in Yakutia that is the “cold pole” in the
Northern Hemisphere, thermometer readings did not
drop below –45.4°C.

In most of the European Russian Federation, it was
also cold in February. Severe frosts persisted in the
southern part of the Evenki Autonomous Area and in
the central Krasnoyarsk Territory (1°–2°C below normal). In western Siberia, particularly in the north,
February was warm. In the north of the Yamalo-Nenets
Autonomous Area, mean monthly temperature anomalies were 6°–8°C. In northeastern Siberia, mean monthly
air temperature in February was 3°–5°C above normal.
February was also warmer than normal in the Tyva
Republic. Maximum positive anomalies (more than
4°C) were recorded in the northwest of the YakutiaSakha Republic and in the east of the Chukotka
Autonomous Area. In Chukotka, warm weather was
accompanied by a large amount of precipitation, frequent snow storms with wind speeds attaining 23–28
and 35–40 m s –1 on the coast, and poor visibility.

Above-average precipitation was also recorded in the
eastern Amur Region, central Khabarovsk Territory,
and Maritime Territory, and on the western coast of
Kamchatka.
In March, a substantial part of European Russian
Federation experienced cold weather: the entire
Northwestern Federal District and nearly all of the
Central Federal District, except for the Voronezh,
Belgorod, and Kursk regions. At the cold center, the
anomalies were –6°C. In Ural, warmer weather was
accompanied by substantial precipitation (200%–300%
of monthly norms). A monthly precipitation norm was
also considerably exceeded in the Volga-Vyatka and
central Chernozem regions (250%–300%). Very large
amounts of precipitation (250%–330% of monthly
norms) were recorded in the southern Far East.
Particularly intensive precipitation was recorded in
Sakhalin and the Maritime Territory in the third 10-day
period.
In April, positive temperature anomalies were recorded
in most of European Russian Federation. East of Ural,
the air temperature was below normal, with temperature anomalies –6° to –8°C in the Yamalo-Nenets
Autonomous Area and in the vicinity of the Ob Bay.
In southwestern Siberia, cool weather was accompanied by high precipitation (170%–230% of the monthly
norm), which, combined with intensive snow melting,
caused torrential spring floods in the Kemerovo region
and Altai Territory. Particularly serious hydrological
conditions were noted on the Biya River near Biysk:
about 500 houses were impounded in the town and
people had to be evacuated.

Kabardino-Balkaria Republic, and allowed soil drought
to persist in the southern and Volga areas of the
Volgograd region. Soil drought was also recorded in
individual regions of the republics of Mordovia,
Chuvashia, and Udmurtia. The southern Khabarovsk
Territory received more than two monthly precipitation norms, which caused high rainfall floods on the
territory’s rivers that had not been recorded since
1961.
In August, very hot weather set in the southern Federal
District. Mean monthly air temperature anomalies
were 5°–6°C. In the first half of the month, air temperatures rose as high as 37°–43°C. On 10 August, air
drought started in the steppe regions of north Osetia;
the dry period lasted 25–35 days, during which the
maximum air temperature exceeded 30°C. Air drought
was aggravated by soil drought. On 23–24 August,
rains in the north and southeast of the Rostov region
stopped soil drought. August in central European
Russia proved to be very rainy. The Kaluga, Tula, Oryol,
and Ryazan regions received more than two monthly
precipitation norms. In Kaluga, August of 2006 was
the most humid in the past century.
In the Far East, warm weather prevailed in August.
Mean monthly air temperature anomalies in the southern Khabarovsk Territory and in Sakhalin exceeded
3°C. The southeast of the Yakutia-Sakha Republic and
the north of the Magadan region and the Khabarovsk
Territory experienced very warm weather. However,

Summer began with hot weather. In nearly the entire
Russian territory, mean monthly air temperatures in
June were above normal. Although temperature
anomalies were no higher than 5°C, positive anomalies
over most of the Russian territory resulted in 2006
having the warmest June on record (1936–2006). In
July, the mean monthly temperature in the west of
European Russian Federation was 0.5°–1.0°C above
normal. In the northwestern region, from 8 to 12 July,
mean daily air temperatures attained 24°–27°C (anomalies of 7°–10°C).

frequent rains were observed in these regions;
some places received more than three monthly
precipitation norms. Okhotsk, for example, received
72 mm of precipitation in 12 hours on 15–16 August.
September, like in the previous year, proved to be
warm in most of the country, though mean monthly
air temperature anomalies were lower than those in
September 2005.
In the first 10-day period of October, cold weather
occurred abruptly in the north of the Irkutsk Region,
causing frost conditions. Strong winds and snow
caused damage of power transmission lines and
power supply failures. For all of October, the northeast of the Far East region experienced a strong heat
center, where mean monthly temperature anomalies
exceeded 6°C. In November, Russia experienced two
large heat foci, divided by a suffi ciently intensive
cold zone. On the Arctic coast and on the islands, as
well as in most of the Far East, November was very
warm. The center of this focus was over continental
zones of the Magadan region and the Chukotka
Autonomous Area. At the center, mean monthly air
temperature anomalies were 13°–15°C. In the east
and south of Yakutia, the Amur region, the northern
Khabarovsk Territory, the north of the Chita region,
and the southwest of the Magadan region, warm
weather was accompanied by a large amount of

precipitation. This is not typical for this season, when
the Siberian anticyclone is normally prevailing in
these regions. As a result, monthly precipitation
norms were exceeded by up to 100%–300% in many
places. This November in Magadan, for example,
following two very low-snow months of November,
161 mm of precipitation (358% of the monthly normal)
was recorded, which is only 5 mm lower than the
1995 absolute maximum.
The end of the year proved to be abnormally warm
over most of the Russian territory (Figure 6.27). The
mean monthly air temperature averaged over the
territories of the quasi-homogeneous regions (region
IV in the center and the south of European Russian
Federation and region V in the center and the south
of western Siberia) was the warmest on record (Figure
6.27b). Meteorological stations at the places of positive anomalies registered record-breaking mean
monthly air temperatures (Figure 6.27a). In Moscow,
for more than 100 years of observations, the mean
December air temperature did not reach such values
as in 2006. It was 1.2°C. Mean daily air temperatures
were above normal during the whole month, except
for 26 December. Daily air temperatures that are
maximal for the whole period of record were exceeded
11 times. On 15 December, the maximum air temperature reached 9°C.

The annual mean temperature of China in 2006 was
9.9°C, which was 1.1°C above the climatology (1971–
2000 mean value). The year 2006 was the warmest
year since 1951 (see Figure 6.28). The seasonal mean
temperature was also above the climatology in all four
seasons, and reached the hottest peak since 1951 in
both summer and autumn.
Above-normal temperatures were observed almost
throughout the whole country. In the northwest, southwest, western parts of north China, Huanghuai region,
the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River,
and western parts of inner Mongolia, the temperature
anomalies were 1°–2°C above normal (see Figure 6.29).
In the winter of 2005/06 (December–February), warmerthan-normal temperatures were observed in most
areas of the Tibetan Plateau, where the temperature
was 2°–5°C above normal. In summer (June–August),
a record-breaking heat wave affected Chongqing and
eastern parts of Sichuan. In Chongqing, from mid-July
to late August, the number of “broil days” in which
the daily maximum temperature was greater than 38°C
was 21. This was significantly above the normal of
3.2 days, and reached the maximum in records. In
autumn (September–November), above-normal temperatures were observed in most regions of China.

A severe drought occurred in Sichuan Province and
Chongqing City during the summer. From June to
August, the precipitation over these regions was
about 67% of normal, and was the lowest since 1951.
Meanwhile, due in part to the heat wave, Chongqing
and Sichuan endured the worst drought since 1951:
about 3.38 million ha of crops were damaged. Total
losses were estimated at 19.3 billion RMB.
Eastern parts of China experienced warmer and drier
conditions during autumn. The precipitation was 50%–
80% less than normal in north China, Huanghuai region,
and western parts of south China during September
to the first half of November. In addition, higher
temperatures were observed almost throughout the
country. This condition enhanced the soil water
evaporation and caused a large-scale drought over
eastern China. More than 6.4 million ha of crops were
affected, particularly in Shandong and Guangxi
Provinces.

In association with the higher temperature, China
experienced a deficient rainfall year. Below-normal
precipitation was observed in most areas of the
Yangtze River valley, north China, and western parts
of northeast and eastern parts of Inner Mongolia.
Rainfall was 10%–50% less than normal in these
regions. From June to the first half of November, the
Yangtze River valley endured dry conditions, and the
average precipitation was the second lowest since
1951, making the river drop to record low levels.

Tropical cyclones

In 2006, there were 24 tropical cyclones with at least
tropical storm intensity in the western North Pacific,
this was below the 1971–2000 average of 27. Six of them
made landfall in China (the average of seven). The first
landfalling typhoon, Chanchu, was earlier than normal
by 40 days. It is the earliest typhoon to directly strike
Guangdong since 1949. From July to August, five tropical cyclones made landfall in China one after another,
with strong intensity, causing devastation. In autumn,
no tropical cyclones made landfall, which is also a rare
occurrence. There were 1522 deaths caused by tropical cyclones in China during 2006 (the most deaths in
10 years). Associated with the southwesterly monsoon,
Tropical Storm Bilis killed 843 people. Supertyphoon
Saomai was the most powerful typhoon to strike China
since 1949; it directly struck Zhejiang Province with a
maximum wind near the center of 60 m s –1 and a minimum pressure of 920 hPa, resulting in 483 fatalities.

over regions from South China to the Jiangnan area
before the third pentad of June. During the fourth
pentad of June, with the subtropical high skipping
northward, southwesterly flow advanced to the
Huanghuai area. Meanwhile, the 340-K isoline of
potential pseudoequivalent temperature moved northward and remained north of 35°N from July to the
first decad of August. During the fourth pentad of
August, the 340-K isoline retreated southward quickly
to 30°N, and to 20°N during the first decad of September.
During the second pentad of October, the 340-K isoline
withdrew from the SCS, which indicated that the warm
and humid air had withdrawn from the SCS. Meanwhile,
at the 850-hPa level, wind flow over the SCS changed
180° to become northeasterly. This indicated that the
SCS summer monsoon came to an end during the
second pentad of October 2006, which was later than
normal.

In spring of 2006, 18 dust weather events occurred,
including 5 strong dust storms. The number of dust
events reached the maximum since 2000. The strongest dust storm occurred on 9–11 April, affecting
13 provinces in northern China; Tulufan Basin in
Xinjiang Province witnessed the most intense dust
storm in the past 22 years. Another dust storm happened on 16 –18 April, which af fec ted about
1.2 million km2, with large impacts in Beijing.

The SCS summer monsoon index was –0.79 in 2006,
which was weaker than average. Pentad intensities
of the SCS summer monsoon were weaker than normal
during most of the time (Figure 6.30). During the summer of 2006, rainfall totals were more than normal in

50%–100% above average in the western Indo-China
peninsula. Meanwhile, heavy amounts of rain associated
with the northeast monsoon contributed to significant
flooding across the central Philippines and parts of
the Malay peninsula. In spring, precipitation was
~50%–100% above average in the northwestern IndoChina peninsula. June–August precipitation was close
to normal, though heavy rainfall associated with the
monsoon affected Viet Nam, Cambodia, and the
Philippines. During autumn, rainfall totals were 30%
to 50% below average in the eastern Indo-China
peninsula, and near normal elsewhere.

Notable events

In the Philippines, heavy rainfall induced deadly
landslides in southeastern Philippines during the
second decad of February 2006; there were at least
139 confirmed fatalities. Typhoon Chanchu crossed
the Philippines during 11–13 May and produced torrential rain, causing 41 deaths and leaving thousands
homeless. Typhoon Xangsane crossed the Philippines
during 27–28 September and was blamed for
110 deaths. Typhoon Durian struck the northern
Philippines on 30 November, with at least 406 fatalities. Across eastern Indonesia, landslides and floods
caused by torrential rain on 21 February killed at least
33 people in the city of Manado. Monsoon-related
rainfall produced flooding in east Java during midApril, and was blamed for at least 23 deaths. Floods
and landslides ravaged eastern Indonesia on
19–20 June, causing about 200 fatalities. In Malaysia
during the mid-December 2005, flooding killed at
least 9 people, and over 17,000 people were driven
into relief shelters.

During the third decad of May, heavy rainfall brought
devastating flooding and mudslides to parts of northern Thailand. More than 100 people may have died
in flash floods. In Thailand during early October, heavy
rainfall in the wake of the remnants of Typhoon
Xangsane was responsible for 32 deaths across the
country, and affected 1.8 million people. Monsoonrelated flooding in central and northern regions of
Viet Nam was blamed for 42 deaths during August.
Typhoon Xangsane made a final landfall in central
Viet Nam in October; there were 68 deaths and nearly
320,000 homes were destroyed or submerged.

SOUTH ASIA M. RAJEEVAN and JAYASHREE REVADEKAR

The year 2006 was marked by extreme weather across
South Asia, both in terms of precipitation and
temperature. In January, many parts of South Asia
experienced severe cold wave conditions with minimum
temperatures dipping below normal by more than
4°C. Minimum temperatures hovered around the
freezing point at some stations like Amritsar (–2°C on
7 January), Srinagar (–7°C on 11 January), and
Ganganagar (–1°C on 8 January). Frost was observed
in New Delhi for the first time in 70 years as cold air
sweeping in from the Himalayas produced a low
temperature of 0.2°C on 8 January. Over north India,
more than 150 deaths were attributed to cold weather
conditions. In neighbouring Bangladesh, unusually
cold weather also claimed some lives during the same
period. However, in February, many parts of South
Asia experienced unusually warm temperatures, which
severely affected the winter crops over this region.
During the month, mean temperatures were 5°–6°C
warmer than normal over northern parts of India and
adjoining Pakistan and Afghanistan. More than
30 stations reported the highest maximum temperatures
ever recorded for the month of February, even some
100-year records. At Allahabad, the monthly mean
maximum temperature in February was 36.3°C,
breaking the previous record set in 1896.
Before the southwest monsoon sets in, heat waves
are common in May and June over northern parts of
India and Pakistan. During the second week of May,
severe heat wave conditions prevailed over northwestern parts of India, with daily maximum temperatures
above normal by 6°C, claiming more than 50 lives. At
some stations, temperatures reached 45°C. Over India,
mean temperatures were consistently above normal

during all the months, except in June. The year 2006
was the warmest year on record since 1901, with the
annual mean temperature above normal (1961–90) by
0.59°C. In January, snowstorms and flooding affected
major parts of Afghanistan, claiming many lives.
Badakhstan was among the worst hit provinces when
snowstorms moved over this region. During April,
flooding due to snowmelt and seasonal rainfall affected
numerous provinces of Afghanistan-like Faryab and
Baghlan. On the other hand, drought conditions and
severe water stress prevailed over some parts of
Pakistan, especially in Balochistan, due to inadequate
rainfall during the winter and spring seasons.
(i)

South Asian summer monsoon (June–September)

The summer monsoon season (June–September) is the
main rainy season over a major portion of South Asia,
contributing 60%–90% of annual rainfall. The onset
phase of the 2006 monsoon season was characterized
by an early monsoon onset over the south peninsula
(26 May). However, after the first active spell associated
with monsoon onset, there was a prolonged hiatus of
about 16 days, due to southward intrusion of stronger
midlatitude westerlies and enhanced convection over
the equatorial Indian Ocean. During this period, the
advance of the monsoon over northern and northwestern
parts of India was delayed. The monsoon revived during
the last week of June and it finally covered northwestern
parts of India and Pakistan during the last week of July,
about 10 days later than its normal date.
Breaking the declining trends observed over the past
few years, a revived occurrence of low pressure systems typical of the summer monsoon was observed
this year. As many as 16 low pressure systems formed
over the Indian region, 12 over the Bay of Bengal,
1 over the Arabian Sea, and 3 over land. Of these
16 low pressure systems, 8 (the highest since 1997)
intensified into monsoon depressions and 1 into a
cyclonic storm (Mukda). In August, four monsoon
depressions formed over the Bay of Bengal, which is
a record since 1891. The monsoon depressions
formed over the Bay of Bengal moved more in a

0

10 20 30

west-to-northwesterly direction, very much south of
the normal track position, thus giving copious amounts
of rainfall over central India. The remnants of these
systems then moved over extreme northwest India
and adjoining Pakistan.
The all-India summer monsoon seasonal rainfall was
near normal (100% of its long period average). However,
rainfall was not well distributed over space and time.
After the first spell of active rainfall activity associated
with the onset phase, the monsoon was more or less
subdued over the country until the third week of July.
As of 26 July, cumulative all-India seasonal rainfall
departure was only 87% of its long period average.
However, the monsoon revived rapidly during the last
week of July and remained active over India and
Pakistan almost until the end of September. In August,
all-India rainfall was 6% above its long period average
and in September, it was 2%.
During this season, out of 36 meteorological subdivisions of India, 6 received excess rainfall, 21 received
normal rainfall, and the remaining 9 received deficient
rainfall. About 60% of the 533 meteorological districts
received excess/normal rainfall and the remaining 40%
received deficient or scanty rainfall. About 25% of the
districts experienced moderate drought and 30 districts
(6%) experienced severe drought conditions on a
seasonal scale. During the second half, the seasonal
trough (monsoon trough) was confined mainly south
of its normal position and all the low pressure systems
moved across central India along the monsoon trough.
Due to this, central India received excess rainfall by
16%, while seasonal rainfall over northeastern parts
of India and adjoining Bangladesh was below normal
by more than 15%. However, northwest and southern
parts of India received normal rainfall during the season
(Figure 6.31). Over Nepal, rainfall activity was below
normal by more than 20% in July and August. Rainfall
activity picked up only in September, during which the
monthly rainfall was above normal.
Pakistan experienced moderately above normal rainfall
(27.2%) during the monsoon season (July–September).

The province of Punjab received normal rainfall (1.5%)
and the provinces of NWFP and Balochistan experienced slightly above normal rainfall (22.0% and 12.4%,
respectively). The province of Sindh had received
largely above normal rainfall (116.6%). Another interesting aspect of this season was the occurrence of
extreme rainfall events. In many places, many heavy
rainfall events occurred, causing localized but severe
flooding. The unprecedented heavy rains and destructive flooding across much of South Asia, including
Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and Nepal, affected more
than 5 million people and resulted in more than
1000 deaths. During the third week of August, unusually heavy rainfall in the Thar Desert over northwest
India caused devastating floods. During the period
16–25 August, 549 mm of rainfall was recorded over
this region, which destroyed thousands of hectares
of standing crops.

central Anatolia does not have very much
precipitation. While Rize receives 2200 mm

only 320 mm. Average annual total precipitation for Turkey is 632 mm according to the
1971–2000 base periods (Sensoy 2004).
The average total precipitation in 2006 was
606 mm, slightly below average. Western

parts of Turkey and the Çukurova Plateau
had been suffering prolonged drought conditions. Approximately 150 stations received
less precipitation than average in the winter,
spring, and summer seasons. Despite these
dry conditions, flood events occurred in
some places. Ten people died in Diyarbakir
in October from flooding.

Difference (0C) from 1971 - 2000

The annual surface temperature anomaly averaged over Turkey in 2006 was
0. 9 ° C above the 1971–20 0 0 average
(Figure 6.32). Only one station (Solhan)
in the eastern part of Turkey had annual
temperatures below average (– 0.59°C).
Generally, western parts of the country
had annual temperatures near average
while eastern parts were above the mean.
Positive temperature anomalies have been
reported since 1994 (except 1997). The
number of summer days ( Tmax ≥ 25°C)
have been increasing all over Turkey while
ice days and frost days have decreased.
Temperatures in January, November, and
December were below average. Between
February and October, temperatures were
near and above average. Significant positive
temperature anomalies (p ≤ 0.05) occurred
during the summer season (JJA).

parts of India and Sri Lanka. During the 2006 northeast
monsoon season, heavy rainfall continued unabated
over these regions especially during October and
December. In India, the states of Tamil Nadu and
Andhra Pradesh were the worst affected. However,
the season known for tropical cyclone activity, witnessed only one tropical cyclone (Ogni), which affected
parts of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. Most of the
rainfall activity during the season was associated with
the movement of easterly waves. The associated
floods in southeast India and Sri Lanka affected more
than 1 million people with at least 100 fatalities and
had a considerable socioeconomic impact. Over these
regions, the northeast monsoon seasonal rainfall was
above normal by more than 15%.

and wetter-than-average conditions occurred in the
western half of the Islamic Republic of Iran during
autumn.
(i)

Winter

Temporal and spatial temperature variability was
intense in winter (2005/06). The Islamic Republic of
Iran experienced anomalously warm temperatures in
February. On average, winter temperatures were 2°C
above that of the long-term. Parts of central and
northeastern Islamic Republic of Iran were 2°–3°C
cooler than normal. The areas with precipitation
amounts near normal or above were the west, southwest, northwest, and Alborz Mountains, while the rest
of the area had precipitation amounts of 75% of normal
or less. The range of winter precipitation was
1250 mm. The largest amount of precipitation was
observed near the Zagros Mountains (Koohrang
1250 mm) in western Islamic Republic of Iran, and the
lowest (5.9 mm) in southeastern Islamic Republic of
Iran. Winter precipitation was 28% less than 2005, and
6% less than the long-term average. Much of the
precipitation falls as snow, especially in December
and January. Heavy rainfall brought flooding to parts
of the southern provinces during February 2006, creating serious transportation problems for the mountain
and cold provinces.
(ii)

Spring

Spring temperatures were mostly 0 ° –2°C above
normal over most parts of the Islamic Republic of
Iran. A few exceptions were Fars, Kerman, Yazd, and
the south, which was 2°C cooler, as well as a few
places that were up to 4° –6°C warmer than the longterm spring averages. The seasonal mean temperatures
ranged from 10°C in the northwest to 35°C in the
southeast. Precipitation totals across the southeast

of the country were only 0%–25% of the long-term
mean, whereas wetter-than-average conditions
prevailed over the central region, which received
100%–260% of its long-term average precipitation.
The northwest region received 50%–100% of normal
rainfall. In general, precipitation increased with
respect to 2005, but was 14% lower than the longterm mean in spring.
(iii)

Summer

Summer was cooler than average over one-fourth of
the Islamic Republic of Iran (in the central and eastern
provinces) while above-average temperatures were
observed in the rest of the country, with averaged
departures 2°C above normal. Many parts including
central, eastern, and some parts of the southwest
received no measurable rainfall. Averaged precipitation was below normal in the summer of 2006, 5%
lower than 2005, and 24% lower than the long-term
mean. Areas with precipitation amounts of 75% normal
to near normal were parts in south, southeast, northeast, and northwest. Dust and sandstorms occurred
in the Sistan and Balochestan provinces in southeastern Islamic Republic of Iran, western Afghanistan, and
Pakistan.
(iv)

Autumn

In autumn, cooler-than-average conditions persisted
across southern and central Islamic Republic of Iran;
warmer-than-average conditions were limited to parts
in the eastern provinces. Cold temperatures affected
many areas during autumn, with many locations
breaking their all-time record minimum temperatures
for the season. Averaged across the nation as a whole,
it was one of coldest autumns in decades. A severe
cold wave, which arrived during early December,
brought some of the coldest temperatures to the
region in decades. Parts of the country were up to
8°C cooler than normal during December. Snow and
cold weather penetrated the northern areas, with
heavy rainfall in eastern and southern areas. For the
country, the average of precipitation in autumn was
83 mm. The largest anomalies were recorded in
Hormozgan Province, with 2.2 times the normal
precipitation (Figure 6.33). From a seasonal perspective, precipitation totals were normal to above normal
in much of the Islamic Republic of Iran during autumn
2006.

Significant weather events

Significant weather events included drought, heat and
cold waves, flooding, and dust and sandstorms. Floods
occurred in northern Iraq in February and November,
in Turkey in July, in Pakistan from late July through
mid-August, in Afghanistan in August and November,
and in the Ardebil Province of the Islamic Republic of
Iran in May. Heavy rain triggered mudslides in Tajikistan
in May and in northern Pakistan on 3 July. In addition,
significant drought continued throughout some parts
of the region. For example, significant drought across
Afghanistan occurred in July as rainfall had been
lacking since April 2006. Dust storms blew and spread
out over a wide area, covering some par ts of
Afghanistan, southeastern Islamic Republic of Iran,
and western Pakistan during summer and autumn.
Other extreme events, such as a severe winter storm
accompanied by heavy snowfall in some provinces
of Afghanistan, and near Dushanbe in Tajikistan,
caused economic losses.

OVERVIEW A. OBREGÓN, P. BISSOLLI, and J. J. KENNEDY

CAMS-OPI precipitation and air temperature anomalies
over Europe are shown in Figures 6.34 and 6.35, respectively. Europe experienced above-normal temperature
anomalies across nearly the entire continent in 2006.6
For the 35°–75°N and 10°W–30°E region the annual
average land surface temperature was 1.15° ±0.08°C
above the 1961–90 average (based on CRU TEM3;
Brohan et al. 2006). The annual average near-surface
temperature, incorporating land and sea surface temperatures, was 0.93 ±0.05°C above the 1961–90 mean
(Figure 6.36). The highest positive annual anomalies
of more than +4°C were found in northern parts of
Greenland and around Svalbard. Large parts of
Scandinavia, northwestern, western, and central
Europe, and even most parts of the Iberian Peninsula
experienced anomalies above +1°C, exceeding the
90th percentile in many areas, and the 98th percentile
in more limited areas in the HadCRUT3 dataset. The

United Kingdom, Spain, and the Netherlands reported
their warmest years in recorded history. The eastern
parts of Europe had smaller anomalies of less than
+1°C. Slight negative anomalies (down to about –0.5°C)
were only registered locally in southern and
southeastern Europe. Seasonal temperature anomalies
in Europe increased throughout the year from winter
2005/06 through to autumn 2006.
Precipitation amounts for the climatological year of
2006 (December 2005–November 2006) were generally above average in eastern and southeastern parts
of Europe, with anomaly maxima over the Arctic
islands, and in Greece and southern Italy, while wide
areas over the western part of Europe received belowaverage rainfall. Areas receiving less than 80% of
normal precipitation amounts were restricted to the
region between the Alps and the Pyrenees, and southern Spain, as well as some coastal regions in the north.
Precipitation anomalies averaged over 2006 were

NORDIC REGION C. ACHBERGER, J. E. BOX, and D. CHEN

Weather and climate conditions in the Nordic region
(comprising Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland,
Iceland, and Greenland) are characterized by a continued pattern of warm anomalies in observational
records for 2006 as compared to recent decades. The
Fennoscandinavian countries (Norway, Sweden,
Finland, and Denmark) and Iceland experienced a
warm summer and an extremely warm autumn. Surface
climate conditions in this area are to a large extent
controlled by the atmospheric circulation over northern
Europe and the North Atlantic region. Synoptic weather
typing, according to the scheme by Lamb (1950), has
been used to estimate the impact of the large-scale
atmospheric circulation on the surface weather conditions in this region (e.g., Chen 2000). Compared to the
1961–90 mean, the frequency of daily southwesterly
and westerly weather types were above normal, which
can explain the warmer-than-normal conditions in
2006. Positive deviations from the normal weathertype distribution are especially obvious during autumn,
with stronger-than-normal large-scale flow from

of anticyclonic days. These flow conditions in autumn
are consistent with the warm and wet weather that
prevailed in extended parts of Fennoscandinavia.
(i)

Fennoscandinavia and Iceland

Annual temperatures in Fennoscandinavia and Iceland
were, on average, well above the long-term means
for 1961–90: 1°–2.5°C depending on the region
(Figure 6.37). For Denmark, 2006 was the warmest
year since 1874. The annual mean temperature was
1.7°C above the 1961–90 mean. For Norway, 2006 was
one of the three warmest years in the country’s temperature record (behind 1934 and 1990). Some
Norwegian regions experienced their largest positive
deviations from the long-term mean (1961–90), such
as Svalbard (+5°C) as well as parts of the county of
Trøndelag and the southern regions of northern Norway
(+2°–3°C). In Sweden, 2006 was also a very warm year.
The annual mean temperature was only 0.3°C below
the warmest year, as 2006 ranked as the sixth warmest
year during 1860–2006. The Finnish annual mean
temperatures were among the 10th–15th highest since
1900. Iceland experienced a warm year. Several selected
Icelandic stations reported annual mean temperatures
placing 2006 among the 5th to 13th warmest year
since about 1870.
Iceland and Norway experienced a rather mild start
to the year, with temperatures above the 1961–90
mean, in contrast to Denmark, Sweden, and Finland.
Spring was characterized by unusually cold weather
in March, occurring almost everywhere in the region.
Summer temperatures were well above the long-term
mean nearly everywhere. Many very hot days (air
temperature > 30°C) were reported in Finland. Norway

106

had its fourth warmest summer since 1900. July
temperatures in Denmark were nearly 4°C higher than
normal. Swedish summer temperatures were also
higher than normal. Temperatures at Svalbard airport
were more than 2°C above normal, which made 2006
the second warmest summer since measurements
commenced in 1912. The warm summer was followed
by an unusually warm autumn in most parts of the
Nordic region, especially in Denmark where the monthly
mean temperatures from September to December
were 3°–5°C above normal, reaching new records.
Finland experienced unusually warm weather from
the second half of November through the end of 2006.
In Helsinki, the monthly mean temperature in December
was 4°C, the highest since 1929. In Sweden, September
and December were extremely warm.
In some parts of the region, precipitation conditions
deviated considerably from the 1961–90 average,
especially in western Norway and the Norwegian
west coast, which were drier than normal. In contrast,
precipitation in Sweden and Denmark were well above
normal values. For Sweden, 2006 became the sixth
wettest year since 1860. Finland’s annual precipitation
was close to normal or slightly above. Iceland got
rather normal amounts of precipitation, though the
southwest of the island had somewhat wetter-thannormal conditions. In several areas, the summer was
either rather dry and/or rainfall was unequally distributed over the summer months. Southern and
western Finland experienced their driest summers
ever recorded. In Sweden, farmers had problems
because of the lack of rain in June and July, but heavy
thunderstorms and strong showers in August led to
serious flooding in many places in southern and
middle Sweden. Conditions in Denmark were similar,
with only half of its normal rainfall amount in July,
but August had 100% above-normal precipitation.
Norwegian summer precipitation was below normal
for most of the country, but strong showers led to
damage from flooding at some places. The Icelandic
summer was rather wet with stormy weather during
July. Wet conditions continued during autumn in
many regions. For example, southern Norway received
precipitation well above the normal. Heavy thunderstorms in October brought large amounts of rain to
many coastal areas in Sweden, while strong and
extended rainfall events in December caused serious
flooding in southwestern Sweden. Finland got part
of its autumn precipitation as snow, leading to all-time

high values of snow cover in southeastern parts of
Finland in the beginning of November.

Greenland

(a)

Upper-air temperatures

Upper-air soundings available from the IGRA (Durre
et al. 2006) indicate a complex vertical pattern of warm
tropospheric and stratospheric cold temperature
anomalies surrounding Greenland (not shown),
compared to the 1971–2000 base period. The general
pattern of lower-tropospheric warm anomalies accompanied by cold anomalies near the maximum height
of the observations (< 100 hPa) is consistent with
overall 1964–2005 warming trends (Box and Cohen
2006). In the lower troposphere, still well above the
surface at the 850-hPa level (1.1–1.5-km altitude), for
example, annual temperature anomalies were between
+0.9° and +3.1°C at six sites surrounding the island.
Over east-central and southeastern Greenland at
Ittoqqortoormiit/Scoresby Sund and Tasiilaq, respectively, a general pattern of lower-tropospheric warm
anomalies is evident with the exception of spring,
perhaps influenced by above-normal sea ice concentration (see section 5B). At the upper limit of mandatory
observational levels (20 hPa), relatively large (–7.1° to
–8.6°C) cold anomalies are evident in the balloon
observations but are not abnormal considering relatively large lower-stratospheric temperature variability
(e.g., Christy and Drouilhet 1994). What else stands
out are +2.4° to +6.6°C warm anomalies centered at
200 hPa in winter for all sites surrounding but
Narsarssuaq in the extreme south. Other regional
patterns of note include warm anomalies below
500 hPa in Autumn (September–November) at Pituffik/
Thule AFB, including apparently extreme, but probably
erroneous, +7.9°C at 850 hPa for September–November
2006, given disagreement with MSU4 data (J. Christy
2007, personal communication). Another relatively
large (+8.5°C) December 2005–February 2006 anomaly
at Aasiaat/Egedesminde may also result from observational error. The potentially erroneous seasonal
anomalies at these two sites also affect the annual
anomalies.

from a collection of stations around the island (Cappelen
et al. 2007), the only signifi cant annual anomalies
indicate higher-than-normal surface air temperatures
(Table 6.1). In 2006, seasonally, for western and southern sites, like in 2005, spring stood out as being warmer
than normal. At eastern sites, cold spring anomalies
are evident and are significant seasonally, but not
enough to effectively cancel the warmer annual anomalies. Eastern winter anomalies were positive, yet
eastern summer temperatures were much lower than
normal. Eastern glacier melt rates are likely to have
been below recent years in 2006, apparently owing
to the eastern coastal cooling effect of April–June
positive sea ice anomalies. Western and southern
summer temperatures imply continued enhanced
glacial melting as sea ice is absent in southwestern
Greenland at this time of year. Considering the past
century at sites around Greenland where long-term
records are available (such as Nuuk and Tasiilaq), the
1930s–40s air temperatures rival recent warm temperatures and suggest that recent extreme melt rates
are not without precedent.

and A. RAMOS

Temperature

The Iberian Peninsula registered temperatures above
the average throughout the year, with the exception
of winter (Figure 6.38). The annual average 850-hPa
temperature across Iberia in 2006 was 1.14°C above
normal (with respect to the 1961–90 period average).
This signifi cant positive annual anomaly occurred
despite the early negative anomaly for the winter

(–1.16°C) that was followed by an extremely hot
spring (+2.38°C), and a warm summer (+1.50°C) and
fall (+1.84°C). It should be stressed that the annual
average temperature for 2006 was the hottest in
Madrid (since 1900) and Barcelona (since 1925). The
corresponding analysis of the associated upper-level
500-hPa geopotential height anomaly field in winter
shows intense positive anomalies between the
Azores archipelago and northern Europe, while
southern Europe is characterized by lower-than-usual
values (Figure 6.38; DJF). Southwestern Europe and
northern Africa were under the influence of strong
cold-air advection from higher latitudes. Several
c old s p e ll s a f f e c te d I b e r ia in Januar y an d
February.
In particular, a strong cold break was observed in late
January affecting all of Iberia, as well as France and
central Europe. This cold plume reached Lisbon,
Portugal, on the western coast of Iberia, producing a
number of days with both maximum and minimum
temperatures below the 10th percentile of daily longterm records. On 29 January the cold break was
responsible for the first snow episode in Lisbon since
2 February 1954!
Unlike winter, the remaining seasons were characterized by warmer-than-normal temperature values,
particularly between late May and November, where
parts or the entire Iberian Peninsula were affected by
five intense heat waves between May and September.
These three seasons were generally characterized by
high values of 500-hPa geopotential height, with
maximum anomalies located in southern (spring),
northern (summer), and eastern (fall) Europe. These

108
StateoftheClimate_2006.indd 108

2/22/08 11:21:38 AM

patterns contributed to the advection of warm air
masses with origins from overheated Eurasia and/or
northern Africa. Moreover, these intense anticyclonic
patterns can induce subsidence over Iberia associated
with further heating of the surface layers through
enhanced adiabatic heating (Trigo et al. 2005).
(ii)

Precipitation

Most of the Iberian Peninsula experienced drier-thannormal conditions during the winter of 2006, as is
clearly shown by the seasonal precipitation percentages computed with respect to the 1961–90 base
period average. Based on the monthly precipitation
dataset from GPCC (Rudolf et al. 2005) it is possible
to see that such winter drought conditions affected a
much larger European region, with the exception of
the western Mediterranean (and northern Africa). From
an atmospheric circulation perspective, the 2006 winter
was characterized by positive (negative) SLP anomalies
north (south) of the Azores–Iberia latitudinal band,
inducing the negative (positive) precipitation anomalies
mentioned. It should be stressed that the Iberian
Peninsula registered one of the worst droughts ever
recorded during 2005, particularly in its southern half
(Garcia-Herrera et al. 2006). The dryness of yet another
winter season had a strong impact on water resources,

DJF

hydroelectric production, and agriculture. However,
the remaining seasons of the year unfolded very differently from winter, with western Iberia characterized
by normal (spring), above-normal (summer), and
extremely high values (fall) of precipitation. In fact,
Portugal, located in western Iberia, registered the third
wettest fall since 1931 (Espirito-Santo 2006), with most
of the country showing values above 200% of the
seasonal average. The spring and fall seasons correspond to the two most important rainfall seasons for
northern and eastern Iberia (Trigo and Palutikof 2001).
Interestingly, both spring and fall seasons were characterized by negative anomalies of SLP over the Atlantic
Ocean and northern Europe. However, the amplitude
of these negative anomalies was deeper during fall
(compared to spring), and covered the entire Iberian
Peninsula, which is related to the intense positive
precipitation observed. Nevertheless, the Mediterranean
coastal sector, including southern France, eastern
Spain, and northern Africa, remained mostly dry
between spring and fall. Therefore, at the end of 2006,
several Spanish provinces located close to the
Mediterranean coast were extremely dry as a consequence of more than two consecutive years with
precipitation below the 1961–90 average.

compared to 1961–90 base period [Source: NCAR–NCEP reanalyses]

Annual average temperatures in the region were
significantly above average (upper decile of the 1961–90
distribution). Central Europe and the Alpine region
experienced one of its warmest years on record with
several record-breaking months and seasons. The
annual mean temperature of Germany was 9.5°C,
which is 1.3°C above normal. Annual average
temperature anomalies in Switzerland varied between
1° and 1.7°C above average, placing 2006 as the fifth
warmest year in the records since 1864. In most areas
of Austria, temperature anomalies in 2006 ranged
between 0.2° and 1.0°C above average. Poland and
the Czech Republic also experienced above-average
temperatures ranging between 1° and 2°C above the
mean temperatures of the reference period
(1961–90).
Temperatures in Germany, Poland, and the Czech
Republic were significantly below the long-term

average at the beginning of the year. In Germany,
mean January temperatures were 2.1°C below the
long-term mean. In Poland and the Czech Republic,
temperatures were even lower and Warsaw reported
an average temperature anomaly of –5.0°C for January.
Temperatures in February also remained below average
over the whole region. March was the coldest in
Germany for 10 years (anomaly of –2.0°C).
The alpine region experienced below-average temperatures from January to March with anomalies
ranging from –0.5° to –1.5°C. In some regions of Austria
temperatures were between –2° and –3°C and temperatures down to –24°C were measured during the
first 20 days of March in Tyrol, with the lowest value
on 13 March. These lower temperatures are consistent
with NAO’s negative phase (Casty et al. 2005); the
NAO had a reading of –0.82 over the December 2005
to March 2006 winter.
In April and May, temperature anomalies rose to
slightly above average (up to +1.5°C). Temperatures
in the summer months (JJA) showed an extreme
contrast. August was well below average in all regions.
July was dominated by an extended anticyclone over
the Azores, which was stationary over Europe for a
long time. This led to an extreme heat wave in central
Europe and adjacent areas (Figure 6.39). The average
temperature in Germany was 21.8°C, the warmest in
the 106-year record, with an anomaly of 4.9°C above
the 1961–90 mean. Temperature anomalies in July in
the Czech Republic were 4°–5°C above average. In
Vienna, Austria, where observations started in 1775,

a new July record for monthly mean temperature
(23.9°C) was set. The warmest areas, with anomalies
above 5°C, were found in the northern parts of the
Alps. August was somewhat cooler than normal
across the region.
Autumn was extraordinarily warm in central Europe
and neighbouring areas. It was by far the warmest
autumn in central Europe since meteorological measurements began. Seasonal temperature averages
in Germany were 3.2°C above the long-term mean.
Remarkably, September average temperatures
(16.8°C, +3.5°C anomaly) across the region were even
higher than in August (15.4°C, –1.1°C anomaly). These
extreme temperature anomalies are mostly explained
by the anomalous southwesterly flow. In Germany,
December was the warmest it has been for 32 years
(3.4°C above normal). Northern Germany, the Czech
Republic, and Poland experienced anomalously high
temperatures exceeding the 90th percentile in places.
The highest anomalies occurred in northeastern
Poland (> 4°C).

COUNTRY SPOTLIGHT: BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
Bosnia and Herzegovina can be divided into
three climate regions, which are covered
by 13 professional meteorological stations.
The lowest air temperature in 2006 was
recorded in January: –24.7°C in Bjelasnica.
The highest air temperatures was recorded
in June in Mostar (41.2°C) Annual precipitation ranged from a high of 1218 mm in Bihac
to a low of 716 mm in Zenica. The lowest
monthly precipitation total was recorded
in October: 11 mm in Jajce. The highest
monthly precipitation total occurred at Ivan
Sedlo (197 mm) in August. Overall, Bosnia
and Herzegovina was 0.4°C warmer normal

in 2006, while annual precipitation was
slightly lower than normal.
Winter 2005/06 was slightly colder than average. December was near normal, January
was significantly colder, and February was
slightly colder than average. Precipitation
was slightly higher than normal, mostly
due to December rains, but the sums in
January and February were below normal.
Spring 2006 had near-normal temperatures:
March was colder than normal, April was
slightly warmer, and May was near normal.
Precipitation was wetter than average,

especially in March when the largest snow
cover on record was reported in Bjelasnica:
345 cm. Average summer temperatures
were near normal, but there were several
periods of extremely high temperatures
(especially in June), and some with temperatures below the LTM. Precipitation was
slightly wetter than normal; some eastern
locations reported their wettest August on
record. Mean temperature during autumn
(all 3 months; OND) were above normal,
especially in October when the mean
monthly temperature anomaly was +2°C.
Fall precipitation was below normal.

Precipitation

Precipitation in central Europe in 2006 was close to
average. Northern Germany and parts of Poland were
drier than average while southern Germany and the
Czech Republic experienced slightly above-average
precipitation. Annual precipitation anomalies averaged over the entire area of Germany were 93% of
normal. Austria experienced below-average precipitation (70%–90%) in the southern provinces, eastern
Tyrol, Carinthia, and southern Styria, but totals were
above average (110%–130%) in the north. In Switzerland,
negative precipitation anomalies were restricted to
southwestern regions and most parts of Switzerland
experienced 110%–140% of their normal precipitation
amount in March and April and the significantly wet
months of May and August.

Notable events

On the evening of 31 October–1 November, a severe
storm occurred over northern Germany. Wind gusts
of more than 150 km h –1 were registered over the
northern German islands. On the island of Borkum,
the water level reached that of the historical flooding
event of 1962.

WESTERN AND NORTHWESTERN EUROPE
A. OBREGÓN, P. BISSOLLI, AND J. J. KENNEDY

(i)

Temperature

In winter, the region was drier than normal with 74%
of the normal precipitation amount in Germany.
January was particularly dry with only 39% of normal
rainfall. Precipitation during the winter mostly fell
as snow. February saw the heaviest snowfall in
southern Germany for more than 10 years. Rainfall
amounts in spring were significantly above average
in many parts of central Europe. Germany received
130% of its normal rainfall. In April, melting of the
large amounts of lying snow coupled with aboveaverage precipitation resulted in one of the largest
spring floods in the past 50 years in southern and
eastern Germany. The Elbe River rose to record levels
in parts of northern Germany, breaking the records
set during the 2002 flood.

Temperatures in northwestern Europe in 2006 were
above average in all areas, with parts exceeding
the 98th percentile of the 1961–90 distribution. The
United Kingdom and the Netherlands, which have
some of the longest weather records in the world,
reaching back to 1659 and 1706, respectively,
reported their warmest years in history. Annual
average temperatures were 1.42°C above the 1961–90
average in the United Kingdom. In Ireland, it was
the warmest year for at least nine years with annual
mean air temperatures reaching up to 1°C above
the normal. The mean annual temperature of 10.6°C
in Dublin was the highest value since reliable measurements began there in 1855. The CET is the oldest
continuous temperature dataset in the world (Parker
and Horton 2005; Parker et al. 1992). The mean CET
for 2006 was 1.35° ±0.09°C above the 1961–90
average and exceeded all values in the series going
back to 1659.

Summer precipitation was correlated with temperature; the warm June and the extraordinarily hot July
were also remarkably dry (50% and 65% of the normal
in Germany). In July, areas of the Czech Republic,
eastern Germany, and the Bavarian forest received
less than one-fifth of the normal average rainfall for
the month. Prague (Karlov) reported only 12.5% of
its normal precipitation. August was unusually wet.
Autumn saw drier-than-normal conditions in Germany
(80% of the normal rainfall), and some areas along
the Danube River received only about 30% of the
average. In southern and eastern Austria, anomalies
ranged between 40% and 80%. Rainfall totals in
September were significantly below average over
large parts of Germany, Austria, Poland, and the
Czech Republic.

Across Ireland and large parts of the United Kingdom,
March was the only month with widespread belowaverage temperatures. The Low Countries and France
experienced an unusually cold winter. Temperatures
in spring were close to or slightly above average in
the Netherlands and France, while summer temperatures were considerably above average in June and
July. August was, by contrast, rather cool. July 2006
was the warmest month on record for the Netherlands
and Belgium, where records began in 1830. The mean
temperature for July was around 5°–7°C above the
30-year meteorological average. Temperature anomalies in July in France were above 4°C in most parts
of the country, where it was the hottest July in the
57-year record and the second hottest month overall
behind August 2003.

111
StateoftheClimate_2006.indd 111

2/22/08 11:21:42 AM

The warmest September in the CET series (16.8° ±0.2°C,
+3.2°C anomaly) contributed to the warmest autumn
(12.6° ±0.12°C). Indeed, in central England, autumn
2006 was nearly seven standard errors warmer than
the next warmest autumns recorded in 1730 and 1731
(11.8°C). Autumn was also the warmest ever in the De
Bilt (Netherlands) series, which started in 1706. The
mean temperature of 13.6°C in De Bilt was exceptionally
high even compared to the previous record temperature
of 12.0°C. September was the warmest ever recorded
in the Netherlands. France experienced temperatures
above the 90th percentile in October and November.
October 2006 was the second warmest month in France
since records began in 1950 with an anomaly relative
to 1971–2000 of +3.3°C.
(ii)

Precipitation

Annual average precipitation was close to the longterm mean for the northwestern European countries.
However, there was significant seasonal and regional
variability. The United Kingdom as a whole registered
107% of normal annual rainfall (1961–90). With 112%
of normal rainfall, Scotland was the wettest British
region in 2006. In Ireland, annual rainfall totals were
above normal over most of the country.
The United Kingdom had its driest winter since 1964.
France, Belgium, and the Netherlands experienced
their highest negative rainfall anomalies in January
and June, with totals in large parts of the country
below the 10th percentile. Spring precipitation was
slightly above normal in most of the region, with the
highest anomalies in Northern Ireland, Wales, and
western parts of England. May was a significantly
wet month in Belgium, Ireland, England, and
Wales, where monthly precipitation totals were
above the 90th percentile (w.r.t. 1979–2000) and the
England and Wales region reported its wettest May
for 23 years.
Summer rainfall in England and Wales was the lowest for a decade. Eastern Scotland, South Wales,
and the southwest were particularly dry. Extremely
dry conditions occurred in the Netherlands in June
and July with very low rainfall amounts (only 39%
of the normal in July), especially in the western part,
which had less than 10 mm of rainfall. In contrast,
August was extremely wet (above the 90th percentile) in the Netherlands, Belgium, and northern

France. The Netherlands reported 297% of normal
values in August.
Autumn was dry in the Low Countries and northern
France, while conditions in Ireland, the United
Kingdom, and western France were much wetter
(150% of the normal in Ireland). The Netherlands
re c eived only 16 % of the monthly average
rainfall in September. Precipitation in France was
lower only in its northern part, while wetter conditions occurred in the south of the country. Northern
Ireland registered its second wettest September
since 1985. Scotland experienced its wet test
November (155% of the normal with some stations
in the west receiving more than double the monthly
average) and December in a rainfall series that began
in 1914.
(iii)

Notable events

At the end of September, the extratropical remnants
of Hurricane Gordon brought strong winds and rain
to the United Kingdom, particularly to Northern Ireland
and Scotland. The remnants of Gordon produced
widespread and sustained rainfall across Northern
Ireland and Scotland, with winds gusting to
130 km h –1 in Northern Ireland. The southwest of
England was also affected by high winds.

Temperature

In 2006, the region experienced above-average
temperatures nearly everywhere, with anomalies
increasing with latitude. The highest positive anomalies
were observed in the Baltic States (e.g., Lithuania
0.9°–1.7°C). Temperature anomalies in eastern Europe
were mainly between 0.5° and 1.0°C.
The year started with unusually low temperatures in
January across the whole region, except northern
parts of Estonia. Temperature anomalies during the
first month were lowest in Belarus and Ukraine. The
Baltic States were affected by the cold wave and experienced similarly low temperatures. In Serbia, a new
record-low temperature of –39.0°C was measured in
Karajukica Bunari on 26 January. February and March
were also cold throughout most of the region.

112

2/22/08 11:21:43 AM

The rest of the year saw mostly above-average temperatures throughout the region. The heat wave in
July affected the western part of eastern Europe.
Serbia experienced a remarkable heat wave between
20 and 29 July with temperatures of 5°C above the
long-term mean. August showed a dipole pattern in
temperature anomalies. The Baltic States and eastern
regions of Belarus and Ukraine experienced high
temperatures, exceeding the 90th percentile, while
temperatures in Hungary, Slovenia, western Slovakia,
parts of Croatia, Serbia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina
were below the long-term mean. Autumn temperatures
were generally well above average, especially in the
Baltic States, Slovakia, and Hungary. The year ended
with extremely high mean temperatures. Temperatures
in December mostly exceeded the 90th percentile.

northeastern and southern parts were very
dry, while central parts received aboveaverage precipitation. Winter 2005–06 was
rather warm, with seasonal temperatures
1°C above the 1961–90 mean. The summer was the hottest in 70 years; seasonal

Precipitation

In 2006, wide areas of eastern Europe experienced
normal or above-average precipitation, while the
Baltic States were mostly drier than normal.
Precipitation in Lithuania was near normal due to an

The distribution of summer rainfall across the whole
region was similar to that seen in the spring with
negative anomalies in the Baltic States and positive
anomalies in eastern Europe. During the last months
of the year, drier-than-normal conditions were to be
found in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Notable events

An extraordinarily swift thaw in April produced extensive flooding along the Danube, which reached its
highest level in more than a century. Areas in Hungary,
Serbia, Romania, and Bulgaria were most affected. In

SOUTHEASTERN EUROPE A. OBREGÓN, P. BISSOLLI, and
J. J. KENNEDY

(i)

Temperature

Temperatures in southern Europe were above average
in 2006 through much of the region. Greece and the
European part of Turkey experienced slightly above
average temperatures. In the western regions of
southern Europe, temperature anomalies were considerably higher. Italy had annual anomalies on the
order of +1°C in the northern and central regions and
about +0.5°C in the south.
In early 2006, Greece, Turkey and southern regions of
Italy were also unusually cold. The monthly average
maximum temperature in Athens was 2.1°C below the
climatological norm. Temperatures in the European
part of Turkey were below the 10th percentile. However,
some areas on the Italian islands (Sicily and Sardinia)
were also warm in the spring (anomalies up to 4°C),
exceeding the 90th percentile.
Summer temperatures were generally above average. In Italy, June was characterized by warming in
the north and in some points in the south (anomalies
up to 3°–4°C). In July, most of Italy experienced
temperatures above the 90th percentile. Monthly
average maximum temperatures in the northeast of

Italy reached new records in some regions.
Temperatures in southern parts of Greece were above
the 90th percentile in August, while regions in northern Italy were colder than the 10th percentile. Southern
Italy, particularly Sicily, experienced unusually high
temperatures in August. In Messina, an historical
high temperature of 41.8°C was recorded. In Bologna,
it was the second hot test autumn since 1948.
December was colder than normal over Greece.
Temperatures in large parts of Italy were above the
90th percentile during this month.
(ii)

Precipitation

Most parts of northern Italy experienced drier-thannormal conditions, while central and southern Italy,
Greece, and Turkey received positive rainfall
anomalies. In the Po Valley in northern Italy, the low
precipitation amounts caused drought conditions
with reduced water availability. Spring was generally
drier than average in Italy and Greece, due mainly
to an unusually dry May. Summer conditions were
generally wetter than normal in southern Italy and
Greece, while northern Italy remained dry, especially
in June. During this month, most of northern Italy
experienced precipitation below the 10th percentile
(1979–2000 base period).
Lower-than-average precipitation was also observed
in Italy as a whole during autumn. Greece was
signifi cantly wet in September (rainfall above the
90th percentile), but precipitation was well below
average in November (below the 10th percentile) in
most regions. Rainfall on the Greek Aegean island
of Samos was 920% of the average October value.
December was dry across most of southeastern
Europe, especially in southern Greece, although
southern Italy and Sicily were very wet.

Temperature

Annual average temperatures were above average
over nearly the whole region. The anomalies were
mostly between 0° and +1°C and partly above +1°C in
the eastern parts (Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and
western Kazakhstan). The cold spell that dominated
Europe in January also affected the Caucasian countries

and western Kazakhstan, where temperatures were
lower than the 10th percentile with anomalies between
–6° and –10°C. In February, warmer air from the
southeast extended into the region and temperatures
exceeded the long-term average during most of the
spring season. The summer, too, was generally above
average, with high anomalies in June and August,
while July was mostly near average. A heat wave
occurred in Cyprus between 19 and 28 August, with
maximum and minimum temperature anomalies of
2°–5°C above normal. The autumn was mostly warmer
than normal. Significant anomalies occurred in October
when eastern parts of the region were 3°C above
average.
(ii)

Precipitation

Precipitation totals from December 2005 to November
2006 were mainly near normal. Cyprus and Azerbaijan
were the exceptions in that they were very dry, with
some areas receiving less than 50% of the annual
precipitation average. The annual average for Cyprus
was 77% of the normal, although October and
November were particularly wet.

AUSTRALIA A. WATKINS and B. TREWIN

Despite only weak-to-moderate El Niño conditions
in the Pacific, Australia, as in 2002, experienced
30N

above-normal pressures during the year, which
suppressed convection and kept cold fronts south of
the continent. As a result, significant dry conditions
were experienced over much of the country by the
second half of 2006. For many of these areas the drought
of 2006 added to significant longer-term rainfall
deficiencies, with large regions having experienced
little recovery from the droughts of 1997/98 and 2002/03,
resulting in severe hydrological drought throughout
much of eastern and southwestern Australia.
However, a vigorous wet season across northern
Australia, as well as the inland penetration of tropical
cyclones into remote areas of western Australia early
in the year, largely offset the acute dry in the country’s
main population and agricultural areas of the south and
east (Figure 6.41). The wetter-than-average conditions
in the north and northwest of the continent earlier in
the year reduced daytime maximum temperatures in
these areas, while high pressures brought clear skies
and cold nights to the southeast and a cool winter in
the Tropics. Overall, much of eastern Australia had
above-average temperatures in 2006, while a small patch
in the north was cooler than average (Figure 6.42).
For eastern and southwestern Australia, the big
drought of 2006 was exacerbated in the latter months
of the year by very warm conditions. Spring 2006
was Australia’s warmest since seasonal records
commenced in 1950. The driest and warmest 5-year
period on record in the major Australian cropping
zones, in addition to a general failure of rainfall during

in agricultural production.
(i)

Temperature

Maximum temperatures for 2006 were mostly above
normal for areas south of the Tropics, resulting in
33% of the continent experiencing daytime temperatures in the top decile (Figure 6.43). New South Wales,
Victoria, and the Murray Darling Basin (Australia’s
“food basket”) all recorded their second warmest
annual maximum temperatures (behind 2002) on
record7 (1.55°, 0.97°, and 1.54°C above average, respectively). Overall, Australia’s maximum temperatures
were the ninth warmest on record, with an anomaly
of +0.60°C.
In some contrast, minimum temperatures for the year
were cooler than normal in the southeast, as well as
in the top end of the Northern Territory and the Kimberly
region of western Australia. However, inland regions
were generally warm at night despite the reduced
cloud cover, with temperatures ~0.5°C above normal.
South Australia and Queensland both had their 10th
warmest nighttime temperatures on record (+0.65°
and +0.56°C above the 1961–90 average, respectively),
and with 40% and 36% of the states in decile 10. The
Australian minimum temperature anomaly for 2006
was +0.34°C, the 17th warmest. Australia’s mean
temperature for the year was 0.47°C above the 1961–90
mean, making it the 11th warmest year on record.
7

High-quality annual Australia-wide temperature anomalies have been calculated for
all years since 1900 (Della-Marta et al. 2004), while high-quality monthly anomalies
are available from 1950. High-quality nationwide rainfall measurements commenced
in 1900 (Lavery et al. 1997). Anomalies are calculated with respect to the 1961–90
average, in accordance with World Meteorological Organization guidelines.

(ii)

Precipitation

With only January, April, and July bringing widespread
near- or above-average rainfall to Australia, 2006
proved to be an extremely dry year for most regions
south of the Tropics (Figure 6.44). Aside from Darwin,
Australia’s northern-most major city, all of the densely
populated regions of Australia, as well as the vast
majority of Australian agricultural areas, experienced
significantly below normal rainfall for the year. Victoria,
New South Wales, and Tasmania had 96%, 45%, and
72% of their state in decile 1, giving them their third
(366 mm), ninth (349 mm), and third (877 mm) driest
years, respectively. For southeastern Australia, this
was the second-driest year (367 mm) after 1982 (355
mm), while in the southwest of the continent, it was
sixth driest (476 mm). It was the driest year on record
for the cities of Perth and Hobart, and the second driest for Adelaide. The agriculturally vital Murray Darling
Basin experienced its third-driest year on record, after
1902 and 1944. When added to the long-term dry, the
resulting inflows to Australia’s second-longest river,
the Murray, were lower than that of the previously
lowest inflows, which occurred in the Federation
drought of 1902. Rainfall anomalies were particularly
extreme in the highlands of eastern Victoria, southern
New South Wales, and northern Tasmania. Stations
such as Burnie in northwestern Tasmania (408 mm,
previous record 670) and Harrietville in northeastern
Victoria (504 mm, previous record 710) were more
than 200 mm below their driest recorded year.
The dry conditions blanketing the major population
and agricultural regions added to long-term rainfall
deficiencies. By the end of 2006, New South Wales had
experienced dry conditions for over five years; southeast Queensland, seven years; Victoria, northern
Tasmania, and eastern south Australia, 10 years; and
in southwest western Australia, some 30 years.
In contrast, the wet season (October 2005–April 2006)
over northern Australia was the fifth wettest since
high-quality rainfall records commenced in 1900, with
an average of 674 mm falling over the period. This
was despite an initially weak and late start to the
Australian monsoon. At Darwin, the monsoon onset
did not occur until around 13 January, about two weeks
later than the usual timing of 28–29 December
(Drosdowsky 1996). Overall, Australia recorded
490 mm (long-term average 472 mm) for the year,

making it the 32nd wettest year of the 107 years of
record. However, such a relatively wet year would be
contrary to the experience of most Australians, with
the vast majority living within the 39% of the continent,
which received rainfall in the lowest three deciles.
(iii)

Notable events

Tropical Cyclone Larry (see section 4) was category
5 shortly before it crossed the coast as category 4, the
most intense system at landfall in Queensland since
1918. Similarly, during the passage of Tropical Cyclone
Monica along the Northern Territory coast, it became
a category 5 system and the strongest ever observed
in the Northern Territory region.
A major unseasonal cold outbreak affected southeastern
Australia from 15 to 17 November (late spring). Snow
fell near sea level in southern Tasmania, above 400 m
in central Victoria, through large parts of the NSW
tablelands, including the nation’s capital Canberra, and
as far north as Queensland. Numerous record low
maximum temperatures were set. A Queensland State
November record of 0.0°C was set at Stanthorpe and
Applethorpe, and Sydney (8.3°C) had its coldest
November night since 1905.
Persistent extreme heat affected much of eastern
inland Australia from late December 2005 through
early March 2006, with many records being set for
average temperatures or consecutive days above
thresholds. At Windorah (Queensland), there were
55 consecutive days above 37.8°C (100°F) from
30 December to 22 February, and 63 consecutive days
above 35°C ending on 2 March. Birdsville’s January
mean monthly minimum of 30.0°C was the first time
an Australian station had recorded a monthly average
minimum of 30°C or above.

A severe early spring heat wave occurred in
southeastern Australia in early October, with many
locations setting early season records. On 12 October
Adelaide reached 37.9°C, Melbourne 36.6°C, and
Hobart 33.1°C, all early season records. This was
Melbourne’s earliest postwinter 35°C+ day on record
(records commence 1856), which followed its earliest
postwinter 30°C+ day which had occurred only the
month before (30.1°C on 19 September 2006). October
was the hottest on record for New South Wales and
Victoria.
Persistent extreme heat affected much of central and
inland eastern Australia during the second half of
November. November record highs were set over much
of southwestern Queensland, and Birdsville reached
48.5°C on 30 November, which was 0.2°C below the
Australian November record set there in 1990. Many
locations set records for extended November hot spells,
including Canberra (11 days above 30°C) and Alice
Springs (12 days above 37.8°C, or 100°F).
Numerous major bushfires occurred in Victoria during
January 2006. There were also significant fires during
this period in Tasmania. With dry and hot conditions,
major fires in South Australia, New South Wales,
Victoria, and Tasmania occurred far earlier than in
previous years. Lightning strikes on 1 December
sparked an immense blaze in Victoria’s Gippsland and
northeast regions. The fire lasted over two months
and burned approximately 1.1 million ha.
With clear skies and very low soil moisture, a number
of major frost episodes occurred in the southern half
of Australia during late May and June. One extreme
event occurred on 30 May, when state records for the
month were set for Queensland (–6.8°C at Stanthorpe)
and Tasmania (–10.5°C at Liawenee). In western
Australia, a state record for June (–6.0°C) was set at
Collie East on 17 June, the same day the city of Perth
recorded its first subzero minimum (– 0.7°C). A
succession of frost events also caused damage in
southeastern Australia during late September and
October. The most damaging event occurred on 25
September, when widespread subzero temperatures
in northern Victoria led to major losses in the Goulburn
Valley fruit crop (estimated at 70 million Australian
dollars). A new Australian record low temperature for
October was set on the 29th when Charlotte Pass (New
South Wales) reached –12.0°C.

NEW ZEALAND J. SALINGER

(i)

General conditions

Erratic and sometimes extreme, New Zealand’s climate
for 2006 featured one of the severest winter snowstorms in decades, a very windy spring, and a rather
cool start to summer in December 2006. The national
average temperature of 12.4°C in 2006 was 0.2°C below
the 1971–2000 normal. Thus, 2006 ended up very close
to the 1971–2000 normal, as a compromise between
very warm months (April and September) and very
cold months (March, June, December). April was the
warmest and June the coldest in the last 30 years,
September was the third warmest on record, and
December one of the coldest in the last 60 years.
Temperatures were above normal in the northeast of
both islands, but below normal in inland areas of the
South Island. Well-below-normal rainfall occurred
throughout parts of central Otago (southeast of South
Island), with totals less than 75% of normal, as well
as in Awatere Valley in Marlborough. Rainfall was well
above normal in the southern North Island and
Christchurch areas, with totals at least 120% of normal.
The year was dominated by more anticyclones in
the Australian Bight/Tasmania area, with stronger
westerlies in the Southern Oceans, giving windier
southwesterlies over New Zealand.
(ii)

Notable events

The highest recorded extreme temperature of the year
occurred during a heat wave in central Otago toward
the end of January. Alexandra recorded maximum
temperatures of 36°C for three consecutive days from
27–29 January (unheard of in the historical record,
commencing in 1930).
The lowest air temperature for the year was –14.0°C
recorded at both Tara Hills, Omarama, on 14 June,
and Fairlie on 28 June. The minimum air temperatures
were –10°C or lower in parts of inland south Canterbury
and/or north Otago, on nine days between 14 and
29 June.
The highest recorded wind gust for the year was
180 km h –1 and was recorded from the northwest, at
Southwest Cape (Stewart Island) on 2 September,
which is a new record for a wind gust at that site. Mean
wind speeds reached 128 km h –1.

The driest rainfall recording locations were Alexandra
in central Otago with 266 mm of rain for the year, followed by Clyde with 286 mm.
Of the regularly reporting gauges, the Cropp River
gauge in Westland, inland in the headwaters of the
Hokitika River, recorded the highest rainfall with a
2006 annual total of 11,370 mm.
Nelson was the sunniest center in 2006, recording
2580 hours, followed by Blenheim with 2528 hours,
and Tauranga with 2,507 hours.
Invercargill recorded its sunniest year on record with
1853 hours, and Kaitai, Tauranga, and Dunedin their
second sunniest.
The year began with significant soil moisture deficits
in the north and east of the North Island and eastern
South Island, which persisted in these regions until
March. March was cold, and an ex-tropical cyclone
produced high rainfall in the north of the North
Island. Flood-producing rainfall events occurred in
north and east Otago and in the Hauraki–Coromandel
region during April. As a result, the month’s rainfall
was very high in these regions. Rainfall in north and
east Otago totalled 300%–400% of normal, and totals
in the Hauraki–Coromandel region were at least
200% of normal. It was the eighth warmest April on
record. May produced well-above-average rainfall
in the north of the North Island, and east of the
South Island, with low rainfall in parts of the south
of the South Island. Two severe winter snowstorms
accompanied by bitterly cold conditions, and later
heavy frost, contributed to a particularly cold June.
Temperatures were 2°C below average in some
regions. It was much sunnier than normal in all
western and southern regions, with record high
June totals in the north of the North Island, and
coastal Otago. In contrast, July was warmer than
June, going against the usual trend. It was very wet
in the south and west of the North Island, with twice
the normal rainfall in Wairarapa with flooding. July
was rather dry in other areas with rainfall totals a
mere 25%–50% or less of normal in the north of the
North Island and Otago. High rainfall continued in
August in the south and west of the North Island,
but it was dry in much of the South Island, and
extremely sunny in the south. September was a
month of climate extremes with record low rainfall

118
StateoftheClimate_2006.indd 118

2/22/08 11:21:51 AM

and high mean temperatures at many locations.
Rainfall was low throughout much of New Zealand,
especially in the east, with some locations recording
10% or less of normal rainfall. In some areas temperatures were 2°C above average, with windy
conditions in the south. It was windier than usual
over most of the South Island and southern half of
the North Island in October, with several locations
in Marlborough and Otago recording their windiest
October in over a decade. November produced
stormy westerlies over the South Island: it was
particularly warm in the east of the North Island,
yet cold in the southwest of the South Island.
Significant soil moisture deficits existed in Northland
and central Marlborough by the end of the year.
December ended the year on a cool note, with one
of the coldest Decembers in the last 60 years, as
more frequent southerlies brought temperatures
2°C below average.
Notable climate features in various parts of the country
included numerous heavy rainfall events of which 18
produced floods. Snowfall events occurred on 11
occasions, mainly in high countr y areas from
midautumn to late winter, with ski areas having an
extended season. Other climate extremes included
a summer heat wave, seven tornado-like incidents,
three severe hailstorms, and many damaging windstorms. The most significant extreme event of the
year was the winter snowfall event over the night of
11/12 June in Canterbury, especially in the south, with
snow settling to sea level. The worst flooding events
during 2006 were those of 25–26 April in Otago and
4–6 July in Wairarapa. In the Otago flood, rivers ran
extremely high, and much of the Taieri Plains including Mosgiel were flooded, with some evacuations.
Floodwaters also affected the towns of Oamaru and
Waitati. The Wairarapa flood occurred during a 3-day
period of high rainfall, also affecting Wanganui and
Wellington.
3)

SOUTHWEST PACIFIC J. SALINGER

This year saw a change from a La Niña to an El Niño climate pattern in the Pacific. The first quarter of the year
was dominated by weak La Niña–like (cold episode)
characteristics, followed by a neutral period. Weakto-moderate El Niño conditions in the tropical Pacific
were in place by September, which peaked in December.
A higher frequency of surface equatorial westerlies

occurred near the date line from August through
November (the highest persistence since the 2002
El Niño event when surface westerlies were much
stronger). Trade winds generally were near normal in
strength at other times of the year. The SPCZ was
farther south than usual from January through May
(typical for La Niña), but was near its normal location
throughout much of the remainder of the year. Belowaverage equatorial SSTs occurred around western and
eastern Kiribati with the cold episode (–1°C anomalies),
returning to normal by April. Positive SST anomalies
(+0.5°C) became apparent near the date line in the
equatorial Pacific in June. These warmed to a constant
+1.5°C above average in the seas around western and
eastern Kiribati from August/September onward.
Negative SST anomalies occurred around New
Caledonia from August through December, more than
1°C below average in October. These features were
also consistent with El Niño development. From January
through June, OLR anomalies showed enhanced convection over the Solomon Islands and Papua New
Guinea. Suppressed convection occurred over western
and eastern Kiribati from January through May, with
a reversal to enhanced convection from August through
December. For much of the year, mean SLP was below
average east of the date line. However, positive anomalies prevailed in the western Pacific over Australia and
the Tasman Sea from May onward.
For 2006 as a whole, above-average SSTs occurred
throughout much of the tropical southwest Pacific.
These were at least +0.7°C above average throughout
central and southern French Polynesia, extending to
the southern Cook Islands and Pitcairn Island. Some
locations experienced above-average SSTs for
11 months of the year. SSTs were at least +0.5°C
above average in many other tropical island nations,
especially those near and east of the date line. SSTs
were near average in the region between Papua New
Guinea and New Zealand, including New Caledonia.
Southwest Pacifi c island surface air temperature
anomalies for 2006 were consistent with the SST
anomalies throughout the region. It was an extremely
warm year in Fua’amotu, Tonga, where the mean
temperature of 24.6°C was 0.8°C above the historical
average and was highest since measurements
commenced in 1980. Tahiti Faa’a, in French Polynesia,
was also much warmer than usual, with a mean
temperature of 26.9°C (0.7°C above the 1971–2000
normal).

119
StateoftheClimate_2006.indd 119

2/22/08 11:21:51 AM

OLR anomalies (Figure 6.45) showed a region of
enhanced convection over Papua New Guinea and
the Caroline Islands to the north, extending southeast
to the Solomon Islands and northern part of Vanuatu.
Another area of enhanced convection, although not
as strong, occurred over Niue and the southern Cook
Islands. Convection was suppressed in a horseshoelike pattern in 2006 over eastern Kiribati and parts of
western Kiribati, extending to the northern Cook
Islands and southeast over the Tuamotu Islands of
French Polynesia and to Pitcairn Island.
-150

The year’s rainfall anomalies were similar to those of
the OLR, with above-average (at least 110% of normal)
rainfall over much of the Solomon Islands, northern
Vanuatu, Niue, and the Southern Cook Islands, as well
as parts of central and southern French Polynesia.
Rainfall was below average (less than 90% of normal)
in the North Tasman and over New Caledonia, as well
as parts of eastern Kiribati and the northern Cook
Islands. One location, Rotuma Island, Fiji, recorded
an extremely high 2006 rainfall of 4378 mm (128% of

annual totals. These were Noumea, New Caledonia,
with 735 mm (75% of normal), and Raoul Island, New

anomalies (°C) and (bottom) precipitation percentiles based
on a gamma distribution fit to the 1979–2000 base period.
Temperature anomalies (1971–2000 base period) are based on
station data over land and sea surface temperature over water.
Precipitation data were obtained from a combination of rain
gauge observations and satellite-derived estimates (Janowiak
and Xie 1999). Analysis was omitted in data-sparse regions
(white areas).
