Foreword
The warming trend observed over the past few
decades continued in 2014, which WMO has
ranked as nominally the warmest year since
modern instrumental measurements began in
the mid-1800s. Although 2014 broke the record
by only a few hundredths of a degree – less
than the margin of uncertainty – this result
means that 14 of the 15 hottest years on record
occurred during the twenty-first century. The
evidence for human-induced global warming
is therefore increasingly robust.
Although discussions of climate change focus
primarily on atmospheric warming near the
Earth’s surface – which is, of course, where we
live our lives – the warming of the ocean is also
critically important. This is because the ocean
absorbs over 93 per cent of the excess heat
trapped by rising atmospheric concentrations
of greenhouse gases. The WMO Statement on
the Status of the Global Climate in 2014 reports
that global-average sea-surface temperatures
for 2014 were warmer than for any previous
year on record. We need to maintain and even
strengthen our ocean observing systems in
order to better understand sea-temperature
trends and their implications for long-term
climate change.
This Statement also highlights extremes that
occurred in 2014 at the national and regional
levels. Europe, for example, was unusually
warm, with 19 countries reporting record temperatures for the year. Severe flooding and flash
floods occurred in many countries, particularly
in the Balkans, South Asia, and parts of Africa
and South and Central America.
Natural climate variability creates such extremes
every year, but the high incidence of flooding
around the world is consistent with an accelerated hydrological cycle driven by the additional
energy captured in the atmosphere by greenhouse gases. As a result of improved scientific
understanding and modelling techniques, good

progress has been made on attributing certain
observed climate extremes and weather events
to human-induced climate change. WMO is
working with its Members and leading scientific
organizations to further advance attribution
research with a view to incorporating it into
operational climate services in the near future.
Despite expectations that an El Niño could
develop, the event did not materialize, making
2014 a neutral El Niño–Southern Oscillation
(ENSO) year. El Niño is typically associated
with elevated global temperatures. Not only
does this mean that 2014 was exceptionally
warm despite not being an El Niño year, but
the failure of ENSO to mature poses important
scientific questions demanding further research.
Another interesting phenomenon in 2014 was
the behaviour of the seas around Antarctica.
While parts of Antarctica’s land-based glaciers
are melting, the sea ice expanded to a record
extent for the third year in a row. Again, this is
an exciting and important area for continued
observation and research.
This Statement draws on data provided by
leading global and regional climate centres
and research institutes as well as National
Meteorological and Hydrological Services. It
is published in the six official WMO languages
in order to reach a broader audience.

TEMPERATURES
The global-average near-surface temperature
for 2014 was comparable to the warmest years
in the 165-year instrumental record. In 2014, the
global average temperature was 0.57 ± 0.09 °C1
(1.03 ± 0.16 °F) above the 1961–1990 average
of 14 °C (57.2 °F). It was 0.08 °C (0.14 °F) above
1

The uncertainty is that estimated for the HadCRUT.4.3.0.0
dataset. Estimates produced for the MLOST dataset at ± 0.12 °C
are comparable. NASA/GISS does not produce uncertainty
estimates for individual years, but the uncertainty of annual
averages from 1950 –2008 is estimated to be ± 0.05 °C.

the average anomaly of 0.50 °C (0.89 °F) for the
past 10 years (2005–2014).
An anomaly of 0.57 ± 0.09 °C (1.03 ± 0.16 °F)
for the year would nominally place 2014 as the
warmest year on record. However, the estimated
uncertainties in the annual averages are larger
than the differences between the warmest years.
Nominally, the three other warmest years are
2010 (0.55 ± 0.09 °C), 2005 (0.54 ± 0.09 °C) and
1998 (0.52 ± 0.09 °C).
The annual average used by WMO is based on
the mean of three global temperature datasets:
HadCRUT.4.3.0.0 produced by the Met Office
Hadley Centre and the Climatic Research Unit
at the University of East Anglia in the United
Kingdom, MLOST produced by the United
States National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration’s National Climatic Data Center
(NOAA/NCDC) and GISTEMP produced by the
United States National Aeronautics and Space
Administration’s Goddard Institute for Space
Studies (NASA/GISS). The Japan Meteorological
Agency also produces an estimate of the global
average temperature, which nominally places
2014 as the warmest year. According to data from
the reanalysis produced by the European Centre
for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 2014 was
in the top 10% of warmest years since 1979.
One of the largest drivers of year-to-year changes
in global temperature is the El Niño–Southern

Oscillation (ENSO). Years that start during an El
Niño episode are typically warmer than those
that start with neutral ENSO conditions or a La
Niña episode. Sea-surface temperatures in the
eastern tropical Pacific at the end of 2013 were
only slightly cooler than average, indicating
that the global temperature of 2014 would not
be strongly influenced by El Niño or La Niña.
The average temperature for 2014 was above the
long-term mean for most land areas. Air temperatures averaged over land were 0.88 ± 0.20 °C
above the 1961–1990 average according to
NOAA estimates, nominally the fourth warmest
on record (fifth warmest in the CRUTEM4 dataset). Areas where the warmth was particularly
notable were western North America including
Alaska, western Eurasia – many countries in
Europe experienced record warmth – eastern
Eurasia, much of Africa, large areas of South
America, and southern and western Australia.
Notably cooler-than-average conditions for the
year were recorded across large areas of the
United States and Canada.

RAIN, SNOW AND ICE
Global average precipitation in 2014 was close
to the long-term average of 1 033 mm, according
to NOAA. As usual, the pattern of precipitation
anomalies was marked by areas of unusually
low and high precipitation. Areas of notably
low precipitation included particularly the

south-west of the United States, north-east
China and eastern Brazil, which all experienced
drought in 2014. Areas of high annual precipitation included the Paraná River basin covering
northern Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay and the
south of Brazil, and the Balkans.
According to data from the Global Snow Lab at
Rutgers University in the United States, winter
snow cover in the northern hemisphere was
above the long-term average. Spring snow cover
was the third lowest on record (since 1966) at
close to 28 million km2. By contrast, autumn
snow cover was the highest on record for the
northern hemisphere (22.2 million km2), with a
record high autumn extent for North America
(9.7 million km2 ) and the third highest extent
for Eurasia (12.5 million km2 ).

Arctic sea-ice extent 2 reaches a maximum in
March and a minimum in September. According
to the National Snow and Ice Data Center, in
2014 the annual maximum daily extent, recorded
on 21 March, was 14.91 million km2, and the
annual minimum daily extent, recorded on
17 September, was 5.02 million km2. This daily
minimum was the sixth lowest on record. The
monthly average extent for September was also
the sixth lowest on record, 1.24 million km2 below

Melting at the surface of the Greenland ice sheet
was above the 1981–2010 average in June, July
and August. The melt-area anomaly for the summer months was above the long-term average,
but it was well below the record melt observed in
2012. Summer 2014 was the warmest on record
for Kangerlussuaq in West Greenland, the area
of highest surface melt. Nuuk had its second
warmest summer since 1784. The snow and ice
were also darker in the summer of 2014 than
they were in 2013; a lower albedo means that
the surface absorbs more sunlight, increasing
melt in otherwise identical conditions.

OCEANS
Most of the energy that accumulates in the
climate system ends up in the oceans. Seasurface temperatures (SSTs) were much warmer
than average across the North and North-East
Pacific as well as the polar and subtropical North
Atlantic, South-West Pacific, parts of the South
Atlantic and much of the Indian Ocean. Belowaverage SSTs were recorded in the Southern
Ocean, to the south of Greenland and parts of
the east Pacific around 20° south of the equator. Global-average SSTs for 2014 were about
0.44 ± 0.03 °C 3 above the 1961–1990 average,
warmer than any previous year on record. Seasurface temperatures were particularly high in
the northern hemisphere from June to October.
Sea level is another important measure of the
climate system. It is related to ocean heat,
as ocean volume increases through thermal
expansion. Water from the melting of ice sheets
and glaciers also contributes. Local variations
in sea level are affected by tides, storms and
large-scale climate patterns such as ENSO.
For most months of 2014, global-average sea
level reached record or near-record levels.4 This
was close to what would be expected given

REGIONAL ANALYSIS
AFRICA
During 2014, temperatures in Africa were close
to or above average in almost all areas where
long-term records are available. Notable warmth
of 1–2 °C above the long-term mean dominated
northern Africa. The average anomaly across
the entire continent was also higher than the
long-term mean, but lower than the record
value for 2010. There were notable heatwaves in
South Africa between 16 and 18 January, when
four high-temperature records were broken.
Hot weather conditions affected Tunisia and
Morocco in late September and October.
Delay and poor distribution of precipitation
characterized the first part of the monsoon
season in many parts of the Sahel (the semiarid southern fringe of the Sahara) from May
to July. There were significant rainfall deficits
in Senegal, Guinea-Bissau and the Lake Chad
area of Niger, Nigeria, Cameroon and Chad. In
the Gambia, annual rainfall was 17% below the
long-term mean, leaving the country in drought
conditions. In Kenya, the “long rains” between
March and May were below average for the
second consecutive season in most areas, and

affected Ethiopia and south-central Somalia.
In March, persistent rain affected large areas
of northern South Africa. Flooding caused by
heavy rains affected Mozambique in March. On
26 March in the city of Pemba, 587.8 mm of rain
was recorded over four consecutive days, setting
a record for that station. In Morocco, 126 mm of
rain fell in four days at Guelmim in November,
an amount that is close to the average annual
total at that location.

Early in the year, heavy rainfall was recorded in
Eastern Africa in late January to February, which
caused flash floods in parts of Kenya and the
United Republic of Tanzania. Heavy rains and
severe flooding were witnessed in October and
November in several locations in Eastern Africa,
including in Kenya, where three stations recorded

Spring in the Russian Federation was the
warmest since records began in 1936, with an
anomaly of 3.12 °C; temperatures in the north
and east were more than 5 °C above average
for the season. In April, the ice started breaking
up on the River Ob in Siberia two weeks earlier
than normal, the earliest in the past 100 years. In
May, daily maximum temperature records were
broken in many parts of the Russian Federation,
and the Republic of Korea experienced its warmest May since records began in 1973.5 In July
and August, parts of the Islamic Republic of Iran
experienced heatwaves where temperatures
rose above 50°C, reaching 53°C at Gotvand in
Khuzestan province on 17 July.

four stations recorded their lowest monthly
rainfall totals for April in the last 50 years. In
South Africa, the North-West Province was
declared to be in a state of drought disaster on
5 September 2013, with the drought continuing
into January 2014. Farmers lost more than 50%
of their crops; estimated losses were about
R2 billion (US $ 170 million). Rainfall totals
during February 2012 to January 2014 were also
exceptionally low in parts of Namibia, southern
Angola and Zambia.

During summer, China was cooler than average over the Yangtze River Basin and in the
north-western part of the country. The lower
reaches of the Yangtze River experienced their

SOUTH AMERICA
In South America, temperatures were above
average across much of the continent. In
Argentina, the average temperature anomaly
for the year places it as the second warmest on
record behind 2012, but slightly warmer than
2013. Temperatures were particularly high in
southern Brazil and northern Argentina. An
October heatwave affected the Plurinational
State of Bolivia and Paraguay. Monthly average
temperatures in the region were the warmest
on record for October.
South America experienced both unusually high
and low rainfall. Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay
and the Plurinational State of Bolivia were wetter
than average between January and October.
Argentina experienced record national rainfall
totals for January to October, thus making 2014
the first wetter-than-average year in the country
since 2003. In May and June, precipitation totals
in excess of 250% of the long-term average
were recorded in Paraguay, southern parts of
the Plurinational State of Bolivia and parts of
south-east Brazil.
Eastern parts of Brazil and countries along
the northern edge of the continent were much
drier than average. Parts of eastern and central
Brazil were still in a state of severe drought

NORTH AMERICA, CENTRAL AMERICA AND
THE CARIBBEAN
In North America, annual temperatures were below
average across the eastern United States and
Canada. In the United States, seven states had one
of their ten coldest years on record. Temperatures
during the winter and early spring were particularly
low due to a persistent weather pattern that also
brought high temperatures to Europe. Continued
cold weather meant that nearly two thirds of the
Great Lakes remained frozen into early April, and
Lake Superior was not completely ice-free until
early June.7 By contrast, the west of the continent,
from Alaska through Canada down to California,
was much warmer than average. In the United
States, eight states had a top-ten warm year and
California, Arizona and Nevada saw record warmth.
Mexico also recorded its warmest year on record.8

A factory building, destroyed by
Typhoon Rammasun, in Leizhou, China, July 2014

was the first tropical cyclone to make landfall
anywhere in Hawaii since hurricane Iniki in
1992. Hurricane Odile brought heavy rain to
Baja California, Mexico, and Hurricane Vance
led to high rainfall totals in November.
In the Western North Pacific basin, 22 named
tropical cyclones formed between 18 January
and the end of the year, with another Tropical
Storm, Genevieve, crossing from the North-East
Pacific, slightly below the 1981–2010 average
of 26 storms; 11 reached typhoon intensity.
Typhoon Rammasun made landfall in the eastern Philippines on 15 July and on Hainan Island
in China on 18 July. It caused great disruption
in the Philippines, Viet Nam and Thailand. In
all, five typhoons made landfall on mainland
China, with total economic losses estimated
at more than US$ 10 billion. Typhoon Hagupit
made landfall in the Philippines in December,
again causing much disruption.
The North Indian Ocean basin recorded three
storms, slightly below the 1981–2010 average of
four storms. Two of these storms – Hudhud and
Nilofar – became very severe cyclonic storms over
the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, respectively. On 12 October, Hudhud crossed the east
coast of India around Visakhapatnam with maximum sustained wind speeds of 170–180 km/h.
Nilofar dissipated over the Arabian Sea. In the

South-West Indian Ocean basin, a total of nine
named tropical storms formed in the 2013–2014
season, with Bruce crossing over from the
Australian basin. The Australian basin experienced an average number of tropical storms in
the 2013/2014 season. The most intense tropical
cyclone to make landfall over Australia in the
2013/2014 season was severe Tropical Cyclone
Ita, which made landfall as a category 4 cyclone.
Tropical Cyclone Ita also affected the Solomon
Islands,16 with heavy rain causing flash floods
in the capital Honiara and across Guadalcanal
Province. In the South-West Pacific basin, 5 storms
formed in the 2013/2014 season, with another
Tropical Cyclone, Edna, crossing over from the
Australian basin, below the long-term average
of 12 storms. Tropical Cyclone Ian made landfall
in northern Tonga on 11 January.

As a result of the Montreal Protocol on
Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, the
use of ozone-depleting gases, such as chlorofluorocarbons and halons, has been phased out.
However, these compounds break down only
slowly and will remain in the atmosphere for
many decades. There is still enough chlorine
and bromine present in the atmosphere to
cause complete destruction of ozone at certain
altitudes in Antarctica during the August to
December ozone season. Because the abundance of ozone-depleting gases changes only
slowly, the size of the ozone hole in any particular year is largely determined by meteorological
conditions. Conditions during the winter and
spring of 2014 were similar to those observed
in 2013. Analyses carried out at both NASA and
KNMI show that the maximum area of the ozone
hole in 2014 (24.06 million km2 on 11 September
and 23.0 million km2 on 16 September, respectively) was similar to that of 2013 (24.01 million
km2 on 16 September and 23.1 million km2 on

Event attribution: an application to
the global and United Kingdom record
temperatures of 2014
Reference: Christidis, N., P.A. Stott and F.W.
Zwiers, Fast-track attribution assessments based
on pre-computed estimates of changes in the
odds of warm extremes. Climate Dynamics, 2015
(online early-view). Authors: Nikos Christidis,
Peter Stott
Detection and attribution studies have demonstrated that human influence on the climate has
been a main driver of the unequivocal warming
of the global climate system observed since the
1950s, according to the Fifth Assessment Report
of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change. Human influence has also led to significant regional temperature increases at the
continental and subcontinental levels. Shifts of
the temperature distribution to warmer regimes
are also expected to bring about increases in
the frequency and intensity of extremely warm
events. It is interesting to note that, unlike
the observed slowdown in the global mean
temperature increase over the last 15 years,
the occurrence of high temperature extremes
has continued to increase across a range of
spatial scales. The fast-growing research area
of event attribution has been developing new
scientific tools to determine the influence of
anthropogenic climate change on extreme
events by estimating the change in the likelihood
of extremes relative to a counterfactual climate
that is not influenced by human activity. Here,
a new event attribution technique is applied to
the global and UK mean record temperature
of 2014.
Event attribution assessments aim to disentangle the contributions of several different
possible influences on the event, such as the
atmospheric circulation, prevalent modes of
climate variability and the state of the ocean
at the time of the event, as well as the effect
of external climatic forcings such as greenhouse gas emissions from human activity.
Such assessments have typically appeared a
year or more after the event occurs and can
therefore be classed as “slow track”. However,
scientists are often questioned about the role
of climate change in the immediate aftermath
of a high-impact extreme event and asked to
provide a robust scientific analysis at media
timescales. Hence, “fast-track” attribution
techniques are being developed to provide
timely assessments of how human influence

18

may have changed the chances of events in
a general case, that is, irrespective of the
specific conditions at the time of the event
under consideration, until more thorough
slow-track investigations become available. A
fast-track attribution methodology was published last year by scientists of the Met Office
Hadley Centre in the United Kingdom based
on pre-computed tables of the change in the
likelihood of temperature extremes. Tables
can be constructed for any region of the world
and are available for the study of both annual
and seasonal temperature extremes.
The methodology comprises three steps. First,
an optimal fingerprinting analysis is carried out.
This analysis combines information from stateof-the-art climate models and observational
datasets to provide the temperature response
of the global climate to different climatic forcings. In the second step, regional information
is extracted from the global response for the
region of interest. Finally, the simulated overall
effect of internal climatic variability is introduced into the analysis. Regional temperature
distributions with and without the effect of
human influence are constructed. Figure 15
shows the resulting temperature anomaly distributions for (a) the global annual mean and
(b) the UK annual mean. The observed temperatures in 2014 are also marked in Figure 15.
Once the regional temperature distributions
are produced, the likelihood of exceeding an
extreme temperature threshold with and without human influence on the climate can be
estimated. Tables of the change in the risk
can then be produced by obtaining likelihood
estimates over a range of thresholds. Once
a record is equalled or broken, as in the two
cases considered here, the tables provide an
instant assessment of the effect of anthropogenic forcings on the event. This enabled
the Met Office to issue a press release on the
record temperatures as soon as the event was
established. Regarding the global mean surface
temperature, the observed record (vertical
black line in Figure 15 (a)) lies within the red
distribution, but in the extreme warm tail of
the green distribution. This suggests that the
record would not have been equalled or broken in a natural climate without the effect of
anthropogenic forcings.

The UK record of 2014 lies within both distributions, albeit more to the extreme warm tail
of the green distribution (Figure 15 (b)). The
UK distributions are broader and overlap to
a greater extent because natural variability
is higher relative to the attributed anthropogenic changes at this smaller scale. At a

global scale, the relative contribution of the
anthropogenic component is much larger,
and thus the distributions overlap hardly
at all. It is estimated that human influence
has increased the likelihood of the observed
record-breaking temperatures in the United
Kingdom by a factor of ten.
