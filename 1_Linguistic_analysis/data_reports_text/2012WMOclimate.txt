Foreword
Since its initial publication in 1993 by the
World Meteorological Organization, the annual
“WMO Statement on the Status of the Global
Climate” has continued to gain in popularity
and importance. The Statement is produced
by the WMO Commission for Climatology in
cooperation with the 191 Members of WMO.
It gathers together the key climate events of
each year. The series stands today as an internationally recognized, authoritative source of
information for the scientific community, the
media and the public at large. I am confident
that this 2012 edition will further contribute
to the success of the series.
Despite the cooling influence of a La Niña episode
early in the year, 2012 joined the ten previous
years as one of the warmest – at ninth place – on
record. Although the rate of warming varies from
year to year due to natural variability caused by
the El Niño/La Niña cycle, volcanic eruptions
and other phenomena, the sustained warming
of the lower atmosphere is a worrisome sign.
The continued upward trend in atmospheric
concentrations of greenhouse gases and the
consequent increase in radiative forcing of the
Earth’s atmosphere confirm that the warming
will continue.
The record loss of Arctic sea ice in August–
September – 18 per cent below the previous
record low of 4.17 million km2 in 2007 – was also
a clear and alarming sign of climate change. The
year 2012 saw many other extremes as well,
such as droughts and tropical cyclones. Natural
climate variability has always resulted in such
extremes, but the physical characteristics of
extreme weather and climate events are being
increasingly shaped by climate change. For
example, because global sea levels are now
about 20 cm higher than they were in 1880,
storms such as Hurricane Sandy are bringing
more coastal flooding than they would have
otherwise.
Hurricane Sandy killed close to 100 people and
caused major destruction in the Caribbean
before developing further strength and causing tens of billions of US dollars in damage
and around 130 deaths in the eastern United
States of America. Typhoon Bopha, the deadliest
tropical cyclone of the year, hit the Philippines –
twice – in December. During the year, the United

States and south-eastern Europe experienced
extreme drought conditions, while West Africa
was severely hit by extreme flooding. The populations of Europe, northern Africa and Asia were
acutely affected by extreme cold and snow
conditions. Severe flooding occurred in Pakistan
for a third consecutive year.
Every single life lost to weather and waterrelated disasters is a tragedy. Fortunately, such
tragedies are being steadily reduced thanks
to improved early warning systems operated 24 hours a day by the world’s National
Meteorological and Hydrological Services,
the enhanced skill and reliability of numerical
weather prediction models, and advances in
radar, satellite and other weather, climate and
water observing systems.
New scientific paradigms must be further
explored if decision-making is to benefit from
advances in our understanding and prediction
of the climate system. In recent years, climate
change has been recognized as an aggravating
factor of climate variability. Climate change has
also become a source of uncertainty for planners and decision-makers in climate-sensitive
economic sectors.
It is vital that we continue to invest in the observations and research that will improve our
knowledge about climate variability and climate
change. We need to better understand how much
of the extra heat captured by greenhouse gases is
being stored in the oceans and the consequences
this brings in terms of ocean acidification and
other impacts. We need to know more about
the temporary cooling effects of pollution and
other aerosols emitted into the atmosphere. We
also need a better understanding of the changing behaviour of extreme weather and climate
events as a consequence of global warming,
and we need to assist countries in the most
affected areas to better manage climate-related
risks with improved climate early warning and
climate watch systems.
The Global Framework for Climate Services,
adopted by the Extraordinary World Meteorological Congress in 2012, now provides the necessary
global platform to inform decision-making for
climate adaptation through enhanced climate
information.

I wish to express the appreciation of WMO
to all contributors, including those National
Meteorological and Hydrological Services of its
191 Members that collaborated on and contributed
to this key publication. As with the previous editions, I would like to underscore the importance
of your feedback. WMO looks forward to your
comments on the WMO Statement on the Status

of the Global Climate in 2012 and welcomes your
suggestions for its further improvement.

Secretary-General

Preface
The present Statement is based on datasets and
information that were made available by WMO
Members and partners for 2012 and assessed in
their global and regional geographical context.
Comparisons were made with climatological
averages and records (historical background)
whenever possible and appropriate.

Many others made their data and climate reports
available on their websites, and these were
accessed when necessary. When doubts arose
as to facts and figures, WMO communicated
with the relevant national source in order to
verify the information before its inclusion in
the Statement.

The global temperature assessment is based on
three independent datasets that are maintained
by the Hadley Centre of the Meteorological
Office and the Climatic Research Unit of the
University of East Anglia (HadCRU), both in
the United Kingdom; the National Climatic Data
Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NCDC–NOAA), based in the
United States; and the Goddard Institute for
Space Studies (GISS) operated by the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA),
also in the United States. The HadCRU dataset
extends back to 1850, and the NCDC and GISS
datasets (and hence the com­b ined dataset)
extend back to 1880. Other datasets have also
been used for additional analysis.

The definition of the Regions is based on the
WMO regional structure, as follows:

The content was developed and peer-reviewed
by several experts affiliated with international
and regional climate institutions, centres and
programmes, and by the world’s National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs),
the main providers of the underlying observations and climate information. More than
50 NMHSs provided direct input to the Statement following the WMO call for contributions.

WMO Climate System Monitoring uses Essential
Climate Variables (ECVs) as defined by the Global
Climate Observing System. Some 50 ECVs have
been identified as feasible for global observation.
The present Statement incorporates assessments of the status of the global climate and
the observed extremes detected using ECV
data and products, including air temperature,
precipitation, ozone and wind speed (atmospheric ECVs); snow cover, fire disturbance and
river discharge (terrestrial ECVs); as well as sea
ice (oceanographic ECV). The Statement also
incorporates findings on soil moisture, an ECV
for which climate information at a global scale
only recently became available.

GLOBAL TEMPERATURES
The 2012 global land and ocean surface temperature is estimated to be 0.45°C ± 0.11°C above
the 1961–1990 average of 14.0°C. That makes it
the ninth warmest year since records began in
1850. It is also the twenty-seventh consecutive
year that the global land and ocean temperatures
were above the 1961–1990 average. The years
2001–2012 were all among the top 13 warmest
years on record.
The 2012 global land and ocean temperature
anomaly was only 0.1°C less than the record
high value observed in 2010. If the latest 30-year
reference period, 1981–2010, which includes the

three warmest decades on record, is used instead
of the 1961–1990 average, the 2012 global land
and ocean temperature anomaly is estimated
to be 0.16°C above the average.
The above figures are based on an average of
the three main global datasets. Other datasets
produce similar but slightly different results. The
Japan Meteorological Agency’s global temperature dataset estimates that the global land and
ocean surface temperature in 2012 was 0.14°C
above the 1981–2010 average, ranking it as the
eighth warmest year on record.
Global average temperatures estimated using
model-based reanalysis data are typically consistent with the observations. According to
reanalysis data from the European Centre for
Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), the
2012 global land and ocean temperature anomaly
of 0.18°C above the 1981–2010 base period tied with
2002, 2003 and 2009 as the sixth warmest year
since ECMWF reanalysis records began in 1958.
The year began with a weak-to-moderate strength
La Niña, which had developed in October 2011.
The presence of a La Niña episode during the
start of a year tends to have a cooling influence on global temperatures, and 2012 was no
exception. The averaged three-month period
of January–March 2012 saw the lowest global
land and ocean temperature for that period since
1997, yet the temperature anomaly remained

Above-average temperatures were experienced
across most of the globe’s land surface areas,
most notably in North America, southern Europe,
the western Russian Federation, parts of northern
Africa, and southern South America. Nonetheless, cooler-than-average conditions were
observed across Alaska, parts of northern and
eastern Australia, and central Asia.

Precipitation around the globe varied significantly
during 2012; however, some features were particularly prominent, such as drier-than-average
conditions across much of the central United
States, northern Mexico, north-eastern Brazil,
central Russian Federation and south-central
Australia. Wetter-than-average conditions were
present across northern Europe, western Africa,
north-central Argentina, western Alaska and most
of northern China. More details are given below
in the section on Regional Climate Features.

2011/2012 winter was below average, resulting
in the fourth smallest winter snow cover extent
on record and the smallest winter snow cover
extent since the winter of 1999/2000. This was
in marked contrast to the previous two winters
(2009/2010 and 2010/2011), which had the largest
and third largest snow cover extent, respectively,
since records began in 1966.
Meanwhile, the Eurasian continent snow cover
extent during the winter was above average, resulting in the fourth largest snow cover extent on
record. Overall, the northern hemisphere snow
cover extent was above average – 590 000 km2
above the average of 45.2 million km2 – and was
the fourteenth largest snow cover extent on record.
During spring (March–May), the North America snow cover extent was the third smallest
on record, at 930 000 km2 below average. In
Eurasia, the snow cover extent contracted to
1.0 million km2 below average, resulting in the
twelfth smallest spring extent on record. As a
whole, the northern hemisphere snow cover
extent during the spring ranked as the sixth
smallest spring extent on record.

Recent analysis of the NOAA snow cover extent
satellite record maintained at Rutgers University
confirms record low snow cover in Eurasia for
June for every year since 2008. In addition,
three of the past five years have seen record low
June snow cover in North America. The June
2012 snow cover extent was below-average at
2.7 million km2 (the June 1967–2012 average
is 7.8 million km2), making it the lowest June
snow cover extent over northern hemisphere
land areas since satellite observations began
in 1967.
Northern hemisphere June snow cover is currently decreasing at a faster rate than Arctic
summer sea-ice extent, and at rates that exceed
the projections of climate models. Estimates
of the historical variation in the volume of
water stored in the seasonal snow pack over
nor thern hemisphere land areas from the
European Space Agency Data User Element
GlobSnow project show gradual decreases
in annual maximum water storage over the
period since 1979. Both datasets show trends
of significantly earlier spring snowmelt over
high latitudes.

Key findings

Sea-ice extent
The areal extent of Arctic sea ice expands
during the northern hemisphere cold season,
reaching a maximum in March, and then melts
during the northern hemisphere warm season,
reaching a minimum in September. During its
2011–2012 growth season, the Arctic sea-ice
extent reached its annual maximum on 20 March
at 15.24 million km2. The averaged March 2012
sea-ice extent was 15.21 million km2. This was
3.4 per cent below the 1979–2000 March average and the ninth smallest March extent since
records began in 1979. However, it was also the
largest March sea-ice extent since 2008.
After reaching its maximum extent in March,
the Arctic sea ice began its melt season. During 2012, the Arctic sea-ice extent tracked near
or above the 2007 daily levels through May. It
then rapidly declined in June and again in early
August, falling below levels observed in 2007.
In August, the Arctic sea ice lost an average
of nearly 92 000 km2 of ice per day, the fastest
observed loss for the month of August on record.
The ice melted so quickly in August that, by
26 August, the Arctic sea-ice extent dropped

Status of the global climate in 2012

34-year record that the month of August recorded
a sea-ice extent below 4.0 million km2.
The Arctic reached its record lowest sea-ice
extent in its annual cycle on 16 September at
3.41 million km2. This value broke the previous
record low set on 18 September 2007 by 18 per
cent. It was 49 per cent or nearly 3.3 million km2
below the 1979–2000 average minimum. The
difference between the maximum Arctic sea-ice
extent on 20 March and the lowest minimum
extent on 16 September was 11.83 million km2
– the largest seasonal sea-ice extent loss in the
34-year satellite record.
Meanwhile, the Antarctic sea ice expands during
the southern hemisphere cold season, reaching
a maximum sea-ice extent in September, and
then melts during the southern hemisphere
warm season reaching a minimum sea-ice
extent in February or March. The Antarctic
observed its fourth largest March sea-ice extent
on record at 5.0 million km 2 or 16 per cent
above the 1979–2000 average. During its growth
season, the Antarctic sea-ice extent reached
its maximum extent since records began in
1979 on 26 September, at 19.4 million km 2 .

This value surpassed the previous maximum
sea-ice extent record of 19.36 million km2 set
on 21 September 2006.
Greenland ice sheet
In early July, Greenland’s surface ice cover
melted dramatically, with an estimated 97 per
cent of the ice sheet surface having thawed
in mid-July. This was the largest melt extent
since satellite records began 34 years ago. During the summer it is typical to observe nearly
half of the surface of Greenland’s ice sheet
melt naturally, particularly across the lower
elevations. However, in 2012 a high-pressure
system brought warmer-than-average conditions to Greenland, which are associated with
the rapid melting.

MAJOR EXTREME EVENTS AND IMPACTS
Notable climate anomalies and events were
observed worldwide in 2012. Some parts of
the northern hemisphere were affected by
multiple extremes, such as major heatwaves
and extreme high temperatures, drought and
wildfires, extreme precipitation and floods,
snow and extreme cold, and tropical cyclones.

The globally averaged CO2 mixing ratio in 2011
reached 390.9±0.1 ppm, which is 40 per cent
Mixing ratio is defined as the abundance of one component of
a mixture (for example, a particular greenhouse gas) relative to
that of all other components (excluding water vapour). Mixing
ratio is an equivalent to a more technical term “mole fraction”.
The following units are used to express mixing ratio:
ppm = number of molecules of the gas per million molecules of
dry air,
ppb = number of molecules of the gas per billion (10 9) molecules
of dry air,
ppt = number of molecules of the gas per trillion (1012) molecules
of dry air.

Due to the necessity of performing post-calibration and
quality-control checks of greenhouse gas observations at the
measurement networks, the data on the greenhouse gases are
delivered to the World Data Centre for Greenhouse Gases only
in the summer of the year following the year of observations,
while the results of global analysis are presented in November
of the year following the year of observations, which creates a
one-year delay relative to meteorological data reporting. The
results of a global analysis of the 2012 observations will be
available only in November 2013.

higher than the pre-industrial level (before 1750).
The annual increase from 2010 to 2011 was 2.0
ppm, which is higher than the average growth
rate for the 1990s (~1.5 ppm/yr) and is the same
as the average growth rate for the past decade
(~2.0 ppm/yr).
Atmospheric CH 4 reached a new high of
1813±2 ppb in 2011, which is 159 per cent higher
than the pre-industrial level. The growth rate of
CH4 decreased from ~13 ppb/yr during the early
1980s to near zero during 1999–2006. However,
since 2007, atmospheric CH4 has been increasing
again, with a nearly constant rate during the
last three years.
The average global N2O mixing ratio in 2011
reached 324.2±0.1 ppb, which is 1.0 ppb above
2010 and 20 per cent above the pre-industrial
level. The annual increase from 2010 to 2011
is greater than the mean growth rate over the
past 10 years (0.78 ppb/yr). The NOAA Annual
Greenhouse Gas Index (AGGI) was 1.30 in 2011;
this corresponds to 2.84 W/m2 (watts per square
metre) of global radiative forcing, relative to
1750, of all long-lived greenhouse gases.
The AGGI indicates an increase in radiative
forcing by all long-lived greenhouse gases of
30 per cent since 1990 and of 1.2 per cent from
2010 to 2011. The radiative forcing by all longlived greenhouse gases in 2011 corresponded
to a CO2-equivalent mixing ratio of 473 ppm
(http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/aggi).

Key findings

POLAR OZONE
The Antarctic ozone hole of 2012 was less
severe than in most recent years, reaching its
maximum daily size at 21.1 million km 2, the
second smallest in the last 20 years. Averaged over the 7 September to 13 October
period, the size of the 2012 ozone hole was
17.8 million km 2 .
The minimum daily average ozone in 2012
occurred on 1 October at 124 Dobson Units
(DU), the second highest value in two decades.

Second, the 2012 Antarctic stratosphere was
unusually active, leading to the transport of
ozone-rich air from neighbouring latitudes into
the South Pole region. This ozone-rich air acted
like a lid on top of the ozone-depleted air masses
underneath, leading to low values for the area
of the ozone hole (that is, the area of the region
where total ozone is less than 220 DU). These
low values occurred despite the fact that ozone
depletion had taken place more or less as normal
in the 14–20 km altitude range.

Two factors contributed to this development
in 2012. First, stratospheric temperatures over
the South Pole region were somewhat warmer
than those seen in recent years. This led to a
smaller extent of polar stratospheric clouds in
comparison with most recent years, although the
Antarctic stratosphere was even warmer in 2010.
The relatively mild stratospheric temperatures
of 2012 would normally have led to a moderately
weak ozone hole, probably somewhere between
the ozone holes of 2010 (relatively weak) and
2011 (rather normal).

Regional climate features
AFRICA
Temperature and precipitation
Much of Africa experienced above-average temperatures during the year, with the most anomalous
warmth across parts of northern Africa. In Tunisia,
2012 was among the top 10 warmest years since
1950. For East Africa, maximum temperatures were
above average in Kenya during January and February. In some areas, the maximum temperatures,
especially in January, were the highest observed
since 2000. In South Africa, the annual mean
temperature anomalies for 2012 from preliminary
station data were on average 0.23°C above the
1961–1990 average. The mean temperatures of
the past 16 years were all above normal.
Northern hemisphere summer precipitation
across sub-Saharan Africa was above average,
with much of western Africa, specifically Senegal,
southern Mauritania, western and eastern Mali,
Niger and northern Burkina Faso, having 40 per
cent or more above-normal precipitation. Several
countries in the Gulf of Guinea and eastern Africa
had precipitation deficits, recording only 70 per
cent of normal precipitation.
Heatwaves and extreme high temperatures
Heatwaves affected northern Africa throughout
the year. Morocco experienced its worst heatwave during June and again from mid-July to
early August, prompting many new temperature
records. In some locations, the new temperature
records were 2°C–3°C above the previous record.

Drought
Below-average rainfall occurred during the
March–May rainfall season across north-eastern
parts of Kenya, with the city of Garissa recording a paltry 19.2 mm, which was 13 per cent of
the average and the second lowest since 1959.
Extreme precipitation and flooding
Many parts of western Africa and the Sahel,
including Niger and Chad, suffered severe
flooding between July and September because
of a very active monsoon. The heavy rainfall
prompted severe floods in 23 states across
Nigeria. The hazardous weather affected nearly
3 million people and caused 300 fatalities. The
floods destroyed farmlands, homes and schools
and caused outbreaks of cholera and other
diseases. The torrential rainfall caused floods
across parts of Niger, destroying thousands
of homes, affecting over 480 000 people and
claiming the lives of nearly 100 people.
Across parts of the United Republic of Tanzania,
heavy rain fell during different episodes in April,
prompting flash floods. In Kenya, record-breaking
rainfall events occurred in May and August, as
well as during the “short rains” season (October–
December). Continuous heavy rainfall occurred
in the western parts of Kenya during the short
rains season. This was mainly attributed to the
positive Indian Ocean Dipole. Some of the rivers
burst their banks and caused flooding, sweeping away some people and displacing others,
as well as destroying infrastructure in the Lake
Victoria basin.
In South Africa, Tropical Storm Dando brought
heavy rains over the north-eastern parts of the
country on 17 January, increasing river flow,
raising dam levels and causing localized flooding.
Extensive flooding occurred across the cities
of Cape Town and Port Elizabeth during June,
causing thousands of people to be displaced.
August once again saw parts of the low-lying
areas of Cape Town flooded. Following heavy
rain in the Eastern Cape on 20–21 October, the
main routes from East London to Port Elizabeth
were closed indefinitely to heavy vehicles due
to road damage.
Extreme cold and snowfall
Cold conditions during late January through
mid-February affected parts of northern Africa,

ASIA
Temperature and precipitation
Most of western and southern Asia experienced
warmer-than-average temperatures during
2012, with the most notable warmth across
north-western Asia. However, cooler-thanaverage conditions were present across parts
of central Asia.
The Russian Federation as a whole had a warm
winter, spring and summer, with temperature
anomalies above the 1961–1990 average. April
was the warmest of all three northern hemisphere spring months relative to normal, with
mean monthly temperature anomalies exceeding 7°C in several regions. The summer of 2012
was the second warmest on record, behind the
record-breaking summer of 2010, and autumn
was the fourth warmest since records began
in 1891.
While China experienced above-average temperatures during spring and summer, temperatures
were below average during winter and autumn.
Overall, the 2012 annual temperature for the
country was 9.4°C, which is 0.2°C below the
1981–2010 average. Mean temperature over
India for the summer monsoon season was
0.61°C above the 1961–1990 average – the second
warmest monsoon year since 1901, behind 2009
and 1987 (+0.80°C). Monthly temperatures in
Thailand during 2012 were warmer than average, with November and December reporting
anomalies in the range of 2°C–3°C above average.
The 2012 annual precipitation in China was
669.3 mm, 6.3 per cent above average. North
China, Beijing and Tianjin experienced their
wettest year in 35 years. Rainfall for India as a
whole was only 69 per cent of average. Rainfall

characterized by remarkable spatial and temporal
variability.
Heatwaves and extreme high temperatures
During April and May, most of China experienced
exceptional warmth, with most areas having
monthly anomalies as high as 5°C above the
1961–1990 average. On 30 April, Hong Kong,
China recorded a daily mean temperature of
28.5°C, tying with 26 April 1994 as the highest
temperature in April since records began in
1884. On 3 May, Hong Kong, China observed
a minimum temperature of 28.0°C, its earliest
occurrence of a “hot night” (minimum temperatures equal to or higher than 28°C).
South-central China experienced a heatwave
from late June to mid-July, prompting the electricity load to rise as high as 3.8 gigawatts in
Changsha city on 9 July, the highest on record.
The warm conditions continued to affect parts
of southern China in August, with Hong Kong,
China experiencing one of its warmest August
months on record.

A heatwave from mid-July to early August
brought daily maximum temperatures between
29°C–37°C across parts of central Russian Federation. Northern Japan experienced extremely
warm conditions from late August to mid-September due to the significantly enhanced North
Pacific High, prompting record-high 10-day mean
temperatures with an anomaly of 5.5°C above the
1981–2010 average in the middle of September.
Drought and wildfires
In China, Yunnan province and south-western
Sichuan province experienced severe drought
during the winter and spring. Nearly 9.6 million
people were affected, over 1 million hectares
of crops were damaged and direct economic
losses were over US$ 780 million. While most
of southern China had near- to above-average
precipitation during the entire year, Hong Kong,
China experienced below-average conditions
with only 80 per cent of the 1981–2010 average
precipitation during the same period. Hong
Kong, China had its driest August since 1992.
Drought conditions also affected parts of western
Russian Federation and western Siberia during June and July. The dry conditions caused
crop failure or damages, resulting in nearly
US$ 630 million in damages.
Drought conditions were present across parts of
the Islamic Republic of Iran throughout the year.
The south-west region experienced moderate to
extreme drought from November 2010 through
November 2012. The dry conditions contributed
to wildfires.
Extreme precipitation and flooding
Parts of southern China experienced their heaviest rainfall in the past 32 years as torrential rain
fell from 5 April to 15 May. On 21–22 July, Beijing,
Tianjin and Hebei had torrential downpours, with
several stations recording their highest daily
precipitation on record. Mentougou recorded
an impressive 305.2 mm of precipitation in one
day. Some US$ 4.5 billion in economic losses

and 114 deaths were attributed to this extreme
rainfall event.
Episodes of extreme precipitation and devastating floods were recorded across parts of western
Russian Federation during May–October and in
the country’s southern Far East during August–
September. On 21 May, the eastern part of the
Krasnodar Territory recorded 110 mm of precipitation in under two hours. The heavy rain caused
floods, inundating nearly 50 homes. Torrential
downpours fell once again in the area in early
July, triggering devastating floods that killed
nearly 200 people, flooded over 5 500 homes
and destroyed infrastructure in the town of
Krymsk. Damages were estimated at nearly
US$ 630 million. On 2 August, extreme flooding
was observed in Khabarovsk Territory, where
river water levels were exceeded by 10 metres.
The heavy rain inundated roads, crops and
60 houses and destroyed a bridge.
Heavy rainfall during the last week of June
prompted severe floods in Assam in northeastern India. The floods claimed nearly 120 lives.
A cloudburst during the night of 13 September
in Uttarakhand (hilly areas of the western Himalaya) washed away many houses and claimed
at least 70 lives.
Devastating floods hit Pakistan during September. Monsoonal rains prompted deadly flooding
across the country, with Balochistan, Punjab
and Sindh the hardest-hit regions. Over 5 million people and over 400 000 hectares of crops
were affected, and more than 460 000 houses
and infrastructure were damaged or destroyed.
Heavy rain fell across parts of the Golestan,
Mazandaran and Gilan provinces in the Islamic
Republic of Iran on 12–13 October, prompting
deadly floods that claimed the lives of six people
and caused damages to agriculture, residential
areas and roads. Economic losses were estimated at over US$ 47 million.
Extreme cold and snowfall
China experienced two cold snaps that had
significant impacts. From mid-January to midFebruary, North-east China through eastern Inner
Mongolia registered minimum temperatures
ranging between –30°C and –40°C. This affected
nearly 41 000 people, damaged 25 000 houses

Regional climate features

and caused a direct economic loss equivalent
to US$ 1.8 million. The cool temperatures contributed to the region having its coldest mean
minimum temperature (–25.6°C) since 1991 and
its fourth coldest since national records began
in 1951.
Snowfall also fell across parts of the country,
with Nyalam registering a total of 91.5 mm
on 9 February, the highest daily snowfall total
on record. The second cold snap occurred on
22–23 August across parts of the country and
affecting 125 000 hectares, the most serious
cold damage since 1961. Nearly 400 000 people
were affected by the cold, and economic losses
were equivalent to US$ 25.7 million.

SOUTH AMERICA
Temperature and precipitation
The 2012 mean temperature was predominantly
above average in South America. The persistence
of warm anomalies in the range of 1°C–2°C was
observed over northern South America, Brazil,
Paraguay and northern Argentina. The persistent
warmth that affected Argentina throughout the
year led to the warmest year on record since
1961, at 0.78°C above the 1961–1990 average.
This value surpassed the previous record year of
2006 by +0.22°C. Spring 2012 was the warmest
such period for the country.

Precipitation was above average during January–March in western parts of northern South
America and in Argentina, with anomalies ranging from 50 mm to 250 mm. By contrast, during
most of the year below-normal precipitation

was observed in Brazil, which bottomed out
in March–May, with a deficit of 300 mm. This
had severe impacts on the populations of the
northern region.
In the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Colombia, Suriname and Guyana, below-average
precipitation was observed from April through
to the end of the year. From August onwards,
precipitation was above average across the
central region of Argentina, with the southern
hemisphere spring (September–November)
being extremely wet for the region.
Heatwaves and extreme high temperatures
A moderate to severe heatwave affected parts
of central Argentina during the first 10 days
of January. The intense heat prompted many
temperature records to be broken and caused
energy supply cuts.
Drought
North-east Brazil experienced a severe drought
during its 2012 wet season, which followed several years of near- to above-normal precipitation.
The severe drought affected over 1 100 towns,
endangering the lives of local people and their
livestock. This was the lowest rainfall registered
in the region in the past 50 years.
Extreme precipitation and flooding
Across northern South America, parts of Colombia were affected by heavy precipitation during
most of the year, with some areas recording
daily totals between 150 mm and 250 mm. The
weather in Colombia during the first four months
of the year was influenced by La Niña, which
produced heavy rain across parts of the country,
leading to the overflow of rivers and floods that
affected thousands of people. In the northern
part of the country, Istmina, Chocó recorded a
total of 251 mm of rain on 31 March, the highest
24-hour amount in March.
In August, extreme heavy rainfall severely
affected the Buenos Aires province in Argentina,
producing severe flooding and evacuations.
Monthly totals broke historical records (since
1875) in several locations across central and
parts of northern Argentina, with nearly double
the previous records for the month of August in
some places. On 6 December, a severe storm
brought heavy precipitation to Buenos Aires.

Status of the global climate in 2012

In a few hours a total of 122 mm of precipitation fell, resulting in the second highest daily
precipitation in December since 1906. In the city
of Rosario, Santa Fe province, extreme rainfall
fell on 19 December, with a total of 178 mm
accumulating in 12 hours, the second highest
daily rainfall since 1935.
Snowfall
In Argentina, the southernmost city in the world,
Ushuaia, was affected by heavy snowfall during
June, equaling the record 19-day snowfalls in
June 1986 and 1995.

NORTH AMERICA,
CENTRAL AMERICA AND
THE CARIBBEAN
Temperature and precipitation
Across North America, the contiguous United
States and Canada experienced anomalous
warmth throughout the year. The 2011/2012
northern hemisphere winter (December–February) ranked as the third warmest for Canada and
for the contiguous United States since national
records began in 1948 and 1895, respectively.

Canada experienced its warmest summer (June–
August) on record, with the contiguous United
States having its warmest spring (April–May)
and second warmest summer on record. Autumn
(September–November) brought cooler temperatures across parts of the contiguous United
States and Canada. Overall, the contiguous
United States had its warmest year on record,
approximately 1.8°C above the twentieth century
(1901–2000) average.
While most of North America was experiencing
unusual warmth during January, anomalous cool
conditions dominated across Alaska, resulting
in the coldest January in the 95-year record
for the state.
Across Mexico, warmer-than-average temperatures were present throughout the year.
February was the only month when coolerthan-average temperatures were present across
parts of the country. In the Caribbean, summer
temperatures were warmer than average, particularly over the Greater Antilles, with some
locations setting all-time records from June
through November. In the metro area of San
Juan, Puerto Rico, summer 2012 was the third
warmest on record, with June 2012 the warmest
month on record.

Regional climate features

Canada observed near-normal precipitation,
just 1 per cent above the 1961–1990 average.
The 2011/2012 winter was the second driest
on record at 18 per cent below average. Precipitation was near average during the other
seasons. Much of the contiguous United States
experienced below-average precipitation, with a
national average of 674.9 mm – 65.3 mm below
the 1901–2000 average. Although many states
had below-average precipitation for the year,
only two states, Nebraska and Wyoming, had
their driest year on record.
In the Caribbean, precipitation was average to
below average during the region’s wet season
(June–November), with June and September
being very dry across the region. In June, totals
of 3.1 mm and 4.1 mm were recorded on Sint
Maarten and in San Juan, Puerto Rico, respectively, the driest June in the 60-year record for
both locations. Other islands that had their top
three driest June were Saint Thomas (second
driest), Saint Croix (third driest) and Antigua
(third driest). Saint Thomas and Antigua had
their driest September on record. During its
dry season (January–May), Grenada recorded
245 per cent of normal precipitation, the wettest
in 27 years.
Heatwaves and extreme temperatures
Major heatwaves affected the northern hemisphere during the year, with the most notable
heatwaves occurring in early spring (March–May)
across North America. Summer-like temperatures affected a large portion of North America
throughout most of March.
In Canada, temperatures soared to record
and near-record levels, contributing to the
warmest March on record across the Prairies
and in the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence
basin. Temperature records were set at many
locations across Canada in March. Winnipeg
registered a maximum temperature of 20.9°C
on 19 March, the earliest recording of temperatures above 20°C in a calendar year. On
21 March, Petawawa recorded a maximum
temperature of 28.8°C, the highest temperature ever recorded in Ontario in March. This
value surpassed the previous record by 16.6°C.
Halifax reported a maximum temperature of
27.2°C on 22 March, shattering its previous
record of 11.8°C set in 1983.

Across the United States, the extraordinary warm
spell resulted in nearly 15 000 new daily records
for high maximum and minimum temperatures
during March, nearly double the number of broken records experienced during the August 2011
heatwave. Every state in the country experienced
a record warm daily temperature during March.
In some cases, the minimum temperature was
as warm as or warmer than the existing record
maximum temperature for a given date.
The hardest hit area was the Midwestern region,
where temperatures were generally 11°C–17°C
above average, with some locations setting
records for the warmest March temperature.
In some instances, the differences between the
new record and the old record were as high as
8°C –11°C. The extreme heat contributed to the
contiguous United States having the warmest
March on record. The heat continued into the
northern hemisphere summer (June–August),
exacerbating drought conditions and fuelling
wildfires.
Drought and wildfires
The year began with severe to exceptional
drought, as defined by the North American
Drought Monitor, across the south central and
south-eastern contiguous United States and
the northern half of Mexico. In the southern

was a continuation of severe drought conditions
that developed in 2011. Drought conditions
evolved across the United States throughout
2012, improving in some areas while deteriorating in others. According to the United States
Drought Monitor (USDM), nearly two thirds of
the contiguous United States (64.6 per cent)
was considered to be in moderate to exceptional
drought on 25 September, the date of peak
coverage and the highest drought footprint in
the 13-year history of the USDM.
Overall, the drought affected an estimated
164 million people and resulted in a multibillion dollar agricultural disaster, the most
severe and extensive impact since the drought
of 1988. Late-summer (June –August) and
autumn (September–November) precipitation
provided substantial drought relief in some areas
across the contiguous United States; however,
significant drought persisted through year’s
end in much of the western and central parts of
the country.
Dry conditions, combined with the heat in
the northern hemisphere during most of the
spring and summer, contributed to devastating
wildfires. Across the contiguous United States,
although the number of wildfires throughout

22

the year was the lowest since 2000, the amount
of acres burned per fire event during the same
period was the largest on record.
Noteworthy wildfires across the contiguous
United States occurred in New Mexico, Colorado
and Oregon. The New Mexico wildfire began
in mid-May as a result of lightning strikes in
the very dry Gila National Forest in the western part of the state. The fire charred over
63 000 hectares, becoming the largest wildfire
in the state’s history. In Colorado, the 2012
wildfire season was the state’s worst season in
a decade, when nearly 102 000 hectares were
burned by wildfires. It was the most destructive
fire in the state’s history and the second largest
wildfire on record in the month of June. Oregon
also reported having its largest wildfire since
the 1860s.
Extreme precipitation and flooding
Across the contiguous United States, several
tropical storms brought much-needed precipitation to drought-stricken areas. Tropical Storm
Debby dumped record rainfall across Florida,
contributing to its wettest June on record. Hurricane Isaac brought heavy rainfall to southern
states, resulting in the second wettest August
on record in Louisiana and Mississippi.

Regional climate features

The beneficial rains across the region helped
improve drought conditions across the Lower
Mississippi River Valley. Florida had its wettest
summer on record, partially driven by the storms.
Prior to reaching the United States mainland,
Hurricane Isaac dropped between 100–200 mm
of rain across Puerto Rico, with locally heavier
amounts across the interior mountains.
Cold and snowfall
In the United States, a snowstorm brought heavy
snow to parts of eastern Colorado and Nebraska
on 2–4 February. In Colorado, 40.4 cm of snow fell
in Denver, setting a February record and surpassing the previous record set in February 1912 by
4.6 cm. Meanwhile, 57.7 cm fell in Boulder, also
setting a February record. In Lincoln, Nebraska,
a total of 28.2 cm was observed, the city’s fourth
largest 24-hour snowfall on record.

SOUTH-WEST PACIFIC
Temperature and precipitation
Most of the South-West Pacific was warmer
than normal. Northern Australia was an exception, with cooler-than-average conditions, but
Australia as a whole had a mean temperature of
0.11°C above the 1961–1990 average of 21.81°C.
The maximum temperatures were 0.51°C above
average.
Despite the high average warmth, minimum temperatures on the Australian continent were cooler
than average, especially from February through
to August, resulting in a January–December
national minimum temperature of 0.28°C below
average. The contrast between high maximum
and low minimum temperatures resulted in
the third-highest diurnal temperature range
on record, behind 1994 and 2002. The winter
(June–August) minimum temperature ranked
as the third coolest for the country as a whole.
Following two very wet years, Australia experienced near-average precipitation in 2012. The
year began with above-average precipitation
for most of the country during January–March,
consistent with the presence of a La Niña event.
March was the third wettest on record for the
country. After the dissipation of La Niña in April,
precipitation was generally below average for
most of the southern regions of the country.

In Fiji, Nadi recorded a total annual rainfall of
3 548 mm, the highest amount in 69 years of
records.
Heatwaves and extreme temperatures
Across parts of Australia, maximum temperatures were well above average from August
onwards. Of particular interest, Evans Head
had a maximum temperature of 41.6°C on
20 October, the highest October temperature
on record for any coastal New South Wales site.
Meanwhile, Birdsville had its earliest springtime
40-degree day on record when it reached 40.6°C
on 20 September.
Drought
After extremely wet years in 2010 and 2011
associated with La Niña, precipitation returned
to near normal over much of Australia in 2012.
The first quarter of the year (January–March)
was much wetter than normal over most of the
country as La Niña still prevailed, but from April
onwards conditions were dry over most areas.
Nationally, the April–October precipitation total
was 31 per cent below normal, the eleventh
lowest on record.
Regionally, Western Australia had its third driest
April–October on record. A number of sites in
the interior of Western Australia and northern
South Australia received less than 10 mm in
the seven-month period. An indicator of the
dry conditions was that no rain fell at Alice
Springs Airport in 157 days from 25 April to
28 September, the longest rainless period in
the site’s 71-year history.
Extreme precipitation and flooding
Across Australia, the most extensive flood event
of the year occurred in late February and early
March as a result of persistent heavy rain in a
region extending from eastern South Australia
through most of southern inland New South
Wales and northern border areas of Victoria.
Heavy rains commenced on 27 February and
continued until 4 March, with weekly totals
exceeding 200 mm over a large part of southern
New South Wales and adjacent areas of northern
Victoria.

Murrumbidgee and Lachlan Rivers reached their
highest flood peaks since 1974, and many towns
were evacuated, including Wagga Wagga, Hay
and Forbes.
The northern and western parts of Fiji experienced severe flooding on 21–26 January. More
than 200 mm of rainfall were recorded across
the majority of the Western Division between 22
and 24 January; notably, 863 mm were recorded
at Vatukoula, 818 mm at Tavua, 579 mm at Nadi
Airport, 552 mm at Lautoka Mill, 547 mm at Penang Mill and 513 mm at Rarawai Mill. These high
rainfall amounts, with already saturated ground
conditions, contributed to severe flooding in the
major towns of Nadi, Ba and Rakiraki.
Rain was particularly heavy and prolonged in
the Western Division, which consequently led
to severe flooding of major rivers, streams and
low-lying areas in the Division until 31 January.
The Western Division experienced one of its
worst floods in the last week of March.
Snow and extreme cold
In Australia, unusually cool minimum temperatures affected much of inland Australia in early
July. South Australia was particularly cold, with
Yunta recording a minimum temperature of
–7.5°C on 6 July, the lowest temperature recorded
in South Australia since 1983. An all-time record
of –5.0°C was set at Marla on 7 July. A lateseason snow event occurred in mid-October.

EUROPE
Temperature and precipitation
Europe experienced warmer-than-average temperatures during 2012, with the most notable
warmth across south-eastern Europe. Warmerthan-average temperatures were evident across
Europe during December 2011 and most of
January 2012. Cold conditions only affected the
region from late January until mid-February,
resulting in an overall mild winter for many
European countries. The anomalous late January to mid-February cold resulted in several
countries experiencing their coldest February
in nearly three decades.
After the severe cold spell, warmer-than-average
temperatures re-emerged, with March bringing
summer-like temperatures to parts of Europe.
Many countries had March temperatures that
ranked among the top three warmest: Norway
(warmest), Switzerland (second warmest), the
Netherlands, Austria, the United Kingdom, France
and Germany (all third warmest). In some locations, the March 2012 average was higher than
that for April 2012, a very unusual occurrence.
While unusual warmth was affecting much of
Europe during March, parts of the south-eastern
region were experiencing cooler-than-average
temperatures. Armenia and Georgia experienced
their second coolest March since 1965 and 1961,

Regional climate features

respectively. The rest of spring brought warmerthan-average temperatures across Europe, with
the exception that parts of northern Europe had
below-average temperatures in April.
Warmer-than-average conditions persisted
during summer across southern and southeastern Europe, the Middle East, Greenland
and western Asia, while cooler-than-average
conditions were observed across northern parts
of Europe, including the northern parts of the
British Isles and the Scandinavia region. Overall, the summer of 2012 is ranked as one of the
warmest summers for several countries in the
southern half of Europe: the warmest in Bosnia
and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro,
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and
Israel (tied with 2010); the second warmest in
Hungary and Slovenia; the third warmest in
Austria; and fourth warmest in Spain.
The summer was also unusually warm across
Greenland, with many areas experiencing their
warmest or near-record-warm summer. Denmark and the United Kingdom, on the other
hand, had their coolest summer since 2000
and 1998, respectively, with northern regions
of Sweden experiencing their coolest summer
in over 15 years.
In Turkey, monthly mean temperatures were
below the 1971–2000 average in January, February and March, with the remainder of the year
experiencing above-average temperatures. The
annual mean temperature for the country was
14.2°C, which is 1.0°C above average. In the South
Caucasus, warmer-than-average temperatures
were present in April and continued through to
the end of June. From August through to the end
of the year, exceptional warmth affected Armenia. The autumn ranked as the third warmest on
record, with the warmest October since 1966.
A marked contrast between northern and southern Europe was observed during 2012, with most
of northern Europe experiencing above-average
precipitation, while southern Europe experienced
below-average precipitation.

matching the wettest year on record set in 2000.
Sweden had its third wettest year since national
records began 150 years ago. After experiencing
its wettest year on record in 2011, Norway had
near-average precipitation in 2012 at 105 per cent
of average. In Finland, the annual precipitation
in 2012 was 739 mm, which is 173 mm above
the 1961–1990 average of 566 mm. This was
the wettest year in Finland since the start of the
gridded precipitation dataset in 1961.
For the sixth consecutive year, Latvia experienced above-average precipitation. The 2012
precipitation total of 832 mm (127 per cent of
normal) marked its fourth wettest year since
records began 90 years ago. Cyprus reported
its wettest year on record since 1902. Turkey
experienced above-average precipitation in
2012, with a mean total precipitation of 745 mm
or 16 per cent above the 1971–2000 average.
Autumn 2012 was the wettest on record since
2001 for Denmark.
Precipitation during January–March in Spain was
37 per cent of average, the lowest precipitation
value for this period since 1947. Drier-thanaverage conditions continued into the summer,
resulting in the second driest summer season
of the last 60 years. Portugal received a total
of 636 mm of precipitation, a deficit of 246 mm
when compared with the 1971–2000 average –
its eighth driest year since 1931. Following the
driest year on record, 2012 was also drier than
average in Hungary.

Parts of the south-east and north-east regions
of Greenland reported a lack of precipitation
during summer 2012. The town of Tasiilaq had
its third driest summer since records began in
1895, and Danmarkshavn’s summer tied with
2003 as the second driest since records began
in 1949.
Heatwaves and extreme temperatures
As in the contiguous United States and Canada, a
warm spell during the last week of March resulted
in many record-breaking temperatures in Europe.
March 2012 was the warmest March on record
in central parts of Sweden, with several stations
recording their highest daily maximum temperature, surpassing their old records by up to 3°C.
Norway recorded a maximum temperature of
23.1°C on 27 March at Landvik (Aust-Agder) in
the southern part of the country, a new national
March record for Norway.
Heatwaves continued to affect Europe throughout the year. In southern Norway, a maximum
temperature of 31.1°C was observed on 25 May,
becoming the country’s highest May maximum
temperature on record. Greenland, which had
above-average temperatures for much of the
year, recorded its all-time highest May maximum
temperature, when temperatures soared to
24.8°C at Ivittuut/Narsarsuaq on 29 May.

26

Slovakia experienced several heatwaves during
the summer. Overall, southern Slovakia had a
total of 37 to 53 tropical days (daily maximum
temperatures greater than the reference temperature of 30°C), which is the second-highest
number of tropical days since national records
began in 1901, behind 2003.
Cyprus experienced eight consecutive days of
40°C or higher daily maximum temperatures,
with the 43.6°C observed on 17 July being the
second-highest temperature recorded in the last
25 years. In Bulgaria, extreme heatwaves were
experienced throughout July, causing hundreds
of people to seek medical attention. The highest
temperature recorded was 41.5°C on 15 July in
Somovit. In Hungary, Budapest experienced
four heatwaves during June–August, resulting
in 24 days with daily mean temperatures equal
to or greater than 27°C, the largest number ever
recorded. Jordan experienced two heatwaves during June and July, observing daily temperatures
as high as 9°C above normal during that time.
France experienced a short, yet significant, heatwave during the second half of August. The event
was noteworthy for its lateness and for breaking
records of maximum temperatures that were set
in the August 2003 major heatwave. The Czech
Republic also experienced heatwaves during
most of the summer; on 20 August, a new record
for the highest maximum temperature was set
when temperatures rose to 40.4°C. Unseasonably warm weather affected southern parts of
Sweden in October. On 20 October, Helsingborg
reported a maximum temperature of 19.7°C – the
highest temperature ever recorded in Sweden
so late in the year.
Drought and wildfires
Significant drought also affected parts of Europe
during the northern hemisphere winter, spring,
and summer. Several countries reported their
driest month in several years: Portugal (driest
February since 1931), France (driest February
since 1959), the United Kingdom (driest March
since 1953), the Czech Republic (second driest
March in the last 50 years) and Germany (third
driest March). Spain recorded its lowest January–March mean precipitation value since 1947.
Dry conditions continued to affect Spain during
the summer, resulting in the second driest summer in the last 60 years.

Regional climate features

However, wet conditions developed across
parts of northern Europe during the end of
spring, while some southern areas had wetter
conditions during the start of autumn. Lack of
precipitation during most of the year, combined
with warmer-than-average temperatures, contributed to severe drought conditions across
parts of south-eastern Europe, greatly affecting
harvest yields, stream flows and water supplies.
In Hungary, the drought that persisted for almost
two years caused severe damage to agriculture,
resulting in a total loss of over US$ 1.8 billion.

rainfall resulted in widespread flooding, affecting
the transport network, inundating properties
and triggering landslides.

Significant wildfires also developed in Europe.
In Spain, nearly 210 000 hectares of land were
scorched by wildfires in the course of the year,
the highest in a decade. The most notable wildfire
ignited on 24 September in Valencia, forcing
nearly 2 000 people to evacuate. In August, southern parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina recorded
a wildfire that burned nearly 5 000 hectares of
land, causing almost US$ 83 million in damage. In Romania, unusually warm temperatures
and the lack of precipitation during July and
August prompted forest fires that charred over
200 hectares of pastures and dry vegetation
across the southern parts of the country.

June and July were very wet months in Sweden.
Stockholm had its rainiest June since records
began in 1786. In early July, heavy precipitation
fell over parts of southern Sweden, triggering
local flooding. On 7 July, Hishult in south-eastern
Sweden received a total of 163 mm of rain, the
fifth highest daily amount on record at an official
Swedish weather station. Across the western
part of mainland Estonia, a total of 93.7 mm of
rain was recorded on the same day, in 12 hours
or less, the largest daily precipitation amount
since 1964 for this region.

Extreme precipitation and flooding
In south-eastern Bulgaria, heavy precipitation
and the melting of snow caused the Ivanovo dam
to break on 6 February, flooding the village of
Bisser. The floods damaged or destroyed nearly
100 homes, damaged crops and claimed the lives
of 10 people. Damages were estimated at over
US$ 2.7 million. Abundant precipitation also fell
during the latter half of May in Romania, causing
floods in more than 100 localities in 20 counties.
The floods damaged nearly 800 houses, crops,
roads and railways. The heavy rainfall also
triggered landslides that blocked a number of
national roads.
After its driest March since 1953, the United
Kingdom experienced its wettest April and June
on record. The wet weather continued through
the summer, which turned out to be its wettest
since 1912. In late November, a series of lowpressure systems brought heavy rain to much
of the country, resulting in one of its wettest
weeks of the last 50 years. With the ground
already saturated due to the wet conditions that
had affected the country since April, the heavy

Several thunderstorms brought heavy rain to
parts of Ireland during June. On 8 June, total
precipitation of 99.5 mm was reported at Lough
Glencar, resulting in the station’s highest annual
and June daily rainfall on record since 1993.
On 22 June, Malin Head experienced its highest annual daily rainfall and June daily rainfall
since 1987.

In Finland, many local precipitation records
were broken throughout the year, especially in
July, September and October. Helsinki recorded
its highest precipitation amount in September
since records began in 1844. In October, many
areas across western Finland reported daily
precipitation ranging between 40–50 mm, with
some areas receiving over 100 mm in one week.
October monthly precipitation averages typically
range between 50–60 mm in this area. In some
cases, the exceptional downpours contributed
to record flooding during the autumn. The floods
caused nearly US$ 8 million in agricultural and
infrastructure damages.
Cold and snow
The cold spell that affected the Eurasian continent during late January through mid-February
was the most notable of the year for its intensity,
duration and societal impact. Across eastern Russian Federation, temperatures ranged
between –45°C and –50°C during the end of January. Several areas of eastern Europe reported
minimum temperatures as low as –30°C, with
some areas across northern Europe and central
Russian Federation experiencing temperatures
below –40°C.

Status of the global climate in 2012

Meanwhile, maximum temperatures remained
below 0°C for several consecutive days throughout most of Europe, with eastern central Europe
having nearly 20 consecutive days below 0°C,
10 days more than the February normal. In
France, the exceptional cold conditions were
the most severe since January 1987, while Switzerland experienced its most significant cold
spell in 27 years. Poland recorded temperatures
as low as –29.9°C, leading to the coldest cold
spell since 2002.
In Austria, temperatures were 10°C below average during the first half of February, contributing
to its coldest February since 1986. Georgia
observed minimum temperatures in the range
of –8°C to –31°C, resulting in the most significant
cold wave since January 2008. On 6 February, Sweden recorded its lowest temperature
since 2001 as temperatures dropped to –42.8°C.
In Portugal, the second lowest average minimum temperature for February since 1931 was
recorded, with an anomaly of nearly 5°C below
the 1971–2000 average. Some parts of eastern
Spain were reporting minimum temperatures
ranging between –10°C and –15°C, resulting in the
most significant cold wave since February 1956.
Across northern Slovakia, daily mean temperatures ranged between –20°C and –23°C, with
minimum temperatures dropping below –30°C.

This was the most significant cold wave since
the winter of 1962/1963 for this region, with the
February average minimum temperatures the
lowest in the last 25 years. The first 10 days
of February were the coldest in 120 years for
Bosnia and Herzegovina. Cyprus recorded a
minimum temperature of –11.1°C in Troodos on
20 February, the second coldest minimum temperature recorded in the last 15 years. Across
Latvia, for five consecutive days (2–6 February)
daily temperatures were below –30°C, only
the third time this has occurred in the country
(the other two times were February 1956 and
February 1999).
The European part of the Russian Federation had
extremely cold temperatures during the period
8–13 February, particularly in the southern
regions, with several cities setting new record
minimum temperatures. Moscow observed a
near-record temperature on 13 February, when
temperatures fell to –28.5°C. The record minimum temperature of –29.3°C was set in 1911.
Across parts of the north-western region of
the Islamic Republic of Iran, temperatures fell
as low as –23.6°C, setting a new minimum
temperature record. The previous record was
set in 1987 when temperatures dropped to
–23°C. Additional information may be found
in the Assessment of the Observed Extreme
Conditions during Late Boreal Winter 2011/2012
(WCDMP-No. 80).
The unusual cold was also accompanied by heavy
snow accumulations. Bosnia and Herzegovina
received 85–107 cm of snow, the highest accumulation in the last 120 years. The heavy snow
accumulation prompted the closure of schools
for 15 days and caused the roof of a sports hall
to collapse under the weight of the snow. Overall, damages were estimated at US$ 40 million.
Several locations across northern Italy recorded
their highest snowfall accumulation in 100 years,
ranging between 250 and 305 cm. Across Europe,
the extreme conditions were responsible for the
deaths of over 650 people.

Tropical cyclones

Atlantic Ocean basin
The Atlantic basin experienced an above-average
hurricane season for a third consecutive year,
with a total of 19 storms, of which 10 reached
hurricane status and only 1 attained major
intensity (the averages are 12 storms, 6 hurricanes and 3 major hurricanes). The season
marked the lowest number of major hurricanes
in the basin since 1997. In terms of the Accumulated Cyclone Energy, which measures the
strength and duration of tropical storms and
hurricanes, the Atlantic 2012 hurricane season
was 142 per cent of average. This makes 2012
an active season, but not exceptionally so, as
there were 10 busier years since 1980.
The Atlantic basin recorded several storms before
the 1 June official start of the season. Tropical
Storm Alberto formed on 19 May, becoming the
earliest-forming tropical storm in the Atlantic
basin since Tropical Storm Ana (20–24 April) in
2003. Tropical Storm Beryl also formed during

May, making it the first time since 1908 that two
tropical storms formed before the start of the
hurricane season. Beryl was also the strongest
pre-season tropical cyclone of record to make
landfall in the United States. Of the 19 storms
formed during the hurricane season, 4 storms
formed before 1 July, the first time this has
occurred since record-keeping began in 1851.
Typically, the fourth tropical storm forming in
the Atlantic basin occurs in August. However,
8 storms formed in August 2012, tying with 2004
for the all-time record for the number of named
storms formed in August.
Hurricane Sandy was the most noteworthy
Atlantic storm of 2012. Sandy wreaked havoc
across the Caribbean, claiming the lives of
nearly 100 people. The strong winds and heavy
downpours brought by the storm significantly
damaged infrastructure, roads and thousands
of homes across parts of the Caribbean. The
contiguous United States was also affected,
prompting severe floods across the north-east
and resulting in over 130 fatalities. Hurricane
Sandy brought record rainfall to parts of the
north-eastern region, with rainfall totals in
some areas ranging from 100 mm to 230 mm.
The heavy precipitation also contributed to
several states having one of their top 10 wettest

The 2012 global tropical cyclone activity was
near the 1981–2010 average of 85 storms, with
a total of 84 storms (wind speeds greater than
or equal to 34 knots (63 km/h)). The number of
storms recorded in 2012 was higher than in the
last two years.

Octobers. Along with heavy precipitation, Sandy
also brought large storm surges and high water
levels to much of the coastal north-east, bringing water levels to an all-time record for several
locations. Sandy was also responsible for the
closure of the New York Stock Exchange for two
consecutive days – the last time this occurred
due to a weather phenomenon was in 1888 in
response to a major winter storm.
Eastern North Pacific Ocean basin
In contrast to the below-average activity of the
last two years in the Eastern North Pacific basin,
hurricane activity was near average in 2012. This
basin recorded a total of 17 storms, 10 of which
intensified to hurricane status (the averages are
17 storms and 9 hurricanes). Like the Atlantic
basin, the Eastern North Pacific basin saw an
early start to its official hurricane season, which
begins on 15 May, when Tropical Storm Aletta
formed on 14 May. This was the first time a tropical storm formed before the official start of the
hurricane season in both the Atlantic and Eastern
North Pacific basins.
A noteworthy storm of the Eastern North Pacific
2012 hurricane season was Hurricane Bud, which

Super Typhoon Sanba,
September 2012

tied with Hurricane Alma of 2002 as the second
strongest May hurricane in the Eastern North
Pacific, behind Hurricane Adolph of 2001. Bud
also set a record for the earliest date on record
for the second tropical storm formation in the
Eastern North Pacific.
Also of note was Hurricane Carlotta, which in
mid-June made the easternmost landfall of any
hurricane in the Eastern North Pacific – along
the coast of the Oaxaca basin in Mexico – since
1966. Although Carlotta brought beneficial rain
to drought-stricken areas, the storm prompted
floods and landslides, damaged roads and crops
and claimed the lives of seven people.
Western North Pacific Ocean basin
The Western North Pacific typhoon season was
near average, recording a total of 25 storms, 14 of
which strengthened to typhoons (the 1981–2010
averages are 26 storms and 16 typhoons). The
Western North Pacific basin was the only basin
to have recorded a typhoon that reached the
maximum of at least 105 knots (195 km/h) sustained for 10 minutes.
Throughout the year, powerful typhoons wreaked
havoc across the East Asia region. Super Typhoon
Sanba was the strongest cyclone globally to have
formed in 2012, with maximum sustained winds
of 110 knots (205 km/h) and central pressure of
900 hPa. Sanba hit the Philippines, Japan and
the Korean Peninsula, dumping torrential rain,
triggering floods and landslides that affected
thousands of people, and causing millions of
US dollars in damage.

NASA

Another noteworthy storm was Super Typhoon
Bopha, which made landfall in the southern
Philippine island of Mindanao in early December. Bopha was the strongest cyclone to make
landfall in the area. It caused widespread damage and left thousands of residents homeless.
Over 1 000 fatalities were reported, with nearly
900 people missing. Damages were estimated
to be equivalent to over US$ 49 million.

30

The Russian Far East set a new record for the
number of tropical and extra-tropical cyclones
in the region since records began in 1970. Six
tropical cyclones struck in 2012, surpassing the
previous records of five tropical cyclones set in
1981 and 2011.

Tropical cyclones

North Indian Ocean and South-West Indian
Ocean basins
The North Indian Ocean recorded a belowaverage season with only 2 tropical storms (the
1981–2010 average is 4 storms), while the SouthWest Indian Ocean 2011/2012 tropical cyclone
season was above average with 11 storms (the
average is 5 storms). Tropical Storm Nilam, one
of two cyclones that formed in the North Indian
Ocean Basin, made landfall on the Tamil Nadu
coast of southern India, causing widespread
damage to property and claiming the lives of
five people. The cyclone moved northwards
over the Andhra coast, causing torrential rains
during 31 October–2 November, claiming over
40 lives and damaging crops and property.
In the South-West Indian Ocean basin, Tropical
Storm Dando made landfall in Gaza province,
Mozambique, on 16 January, the first tropical
storm to hit southern Mozambique since Tropical
Storm Domoina in 1984. Dando brought heavy
rain to the region, prompting deadly floods.
Tropical Cyclone Giovanna made landfall on
Madagascar on 14 February with maximum sustained winds of 68 knots (126 km/h), equivalent
to a Category 4 storm on the Saffir–Simpson
Hurricane Scale (SSHS). The storm struck the
island with vicious winds and heavy precipitation, resulting in nearly 25 fatalities and affecting
thousands of people. Cyclone Anais, the first
intense cyclone on record for the month of
October, formed on 12 October and was thus a

2012/2013 season cyclone. Anais was the second
earliest tropical cyclone to form so early in the
season, after Tropical Cyclone Blanche in 1969.
Australian basin
The Australian basin recorded a below-average
cyclone season, with 7 storms (the average is
11 storms). The strongest cyclone of the season
was Lua, a Category 2 storm on the SSHS. Lua
made landfall at that intensity on 17 March in
Western Australia, before its remnants moved
inland over Western Australia. The areas affected
by the cyclone were sparsely populated, and
only limited damage was reported.
South-West Pacific Ocean basin
The 2011/2012 tropical cyclone season in the
South-West Pacific was below-average, with only
3 named tropical storms (the 1981–2010 average
is 8 storms). Only 1 of those, Jasmine, attained
major status, equivalent to a Category 4 on the
SSHS. Tropical Cyclone Evan, which formed on 9
December, made landfall in Samoa, causing great
devastation and widespread damage to agricultural crops, roads, homes and schools. It was
the worst cyclone to strike Samoa since Tropical
Cyclone Val in 1991. Tropical Cyclone Evan generated winds gusting as high as 84 knots (156 km/h),
a new record since observations began in 1971
on the Island of Wallis. Near Futuna, winds gusts
as high as 82 knots (152 km/h) were recorded,
the second strongest wind gust measured on the
island since the opening of the station in 1981.

The use of Earth observation satellites for
soil moisture monitoring
Wolfgang Wagner, Wouter Dorigo and Christoph Paulik, Vienna University of Technology, Austria
Soil moisture strongly influences the exchange
of water and energy between the land surface
and the atmosphere and is thus a key variable
of the climate system. While many of its effects
on the climate system, such as the role of soil
moisture deficits in the occurrence of heatwaves,
are reasonably well understood, progress in the
scientific understanding of soil moisture–climate
interaction has so far been hampered by the lack
of soil moisture observations. Fortunately, this
situation has improved significantly in the last
few years thanks to the increasing availability
of in situ (for example, through the International
Soil Moisture Network – see www.ipf.tuwien.
ac.at/insitu/) and satellite-based soil moisture
observations.

MICROWAVE REMOTE-SENSING OF
SOIL MOISTURE
Many Earth observation satellites carry microwave sensors that measure the emission or the
reflection of microwave radiation by the Earth’s
surface. The signal received by these microwave
sensors is sensitive to the amount of water
contained in the first few centimetres of the soil
because, at microwave frequencies, the water
molecules contained in the soil rotate as they try
to align themselves with the alternating electric
field of the microwaves. This rotation not only
leads to a minuscule heating of the soil (an effect
that is exploited at much higher energy levels
in microwave ovens) but also causes scattering
of the microwave radiation. Therefore, active
microwave instruments (radars) that illuminate a
wet soil generally receive a higher backscattered
signal than when illuminating a dry soil. For the
same reason, wet soil surfaces transmit less
natural microwave radiation emanating from
deeper soil layers than dry soils, which implies
that the natural radiation received by passive
microwave instruments (radiometers) decreases
with increasing surface soil moisture content.
Despite the strong relationship between soil
moisture and microwave observations, it has
been quite difficult to develop operational Earth
observation capabilities. Technologically, one
of the challenges has been to build sensors
that are capable of measuring the low energy
of microwave signals with good radiometric
accuracy. Another challenge has been to push
the sensor wavelength to longer wavelengths

32

in order to maximize the sensitivity to soil moisture, but without negative repercussions on the
spatial resolution and coverage. Scientifically,
the task has been to develop algorithms that
single out the soil moisture signal from a host
of other parameters affecting the microwave
observations, such as the vegetation cover or the
roughness of the soil surface. While many scientific questions are still only partially answered,
the retrieval algorithms have matured up to a
point where global-scale processing has become
feasible.

A VIRTUAL CONSTELLATION OF SOIL
MOISTURE SATELLITES
So far only one Earth observation satellite has
been built and launched for the primary purpose
of measuring soil moisture over land, namely
the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS)
satellite launched by the European Space Agency
(ESA) in November 2009. The next dedicated
soil moisture satellite will be the Soil Moisture
Active-Passive (SMAP) mission that is foreseen
to be launched by the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA) in the 2014–2015
time frame. But these two dedicated explorative
missions are not alone; there is a fleet of other
satellites with microwave remote-sensing instruments on board. These instruments have been
built for other purposes, for example, for sea-ice
or ocean wind monitoring, but they can nonetheless also be used for measuring soil moisture.
As a result, there are now several satellites in
orbit which, taken together, provide several
soil moisture measurements per day for each
point of the Earth’s land surface. One may thus
think of these satellites as a virtual constellation
providing day-round global-scale soil moisture
observations.
Unfortunately, it is still quite difficult to directly
compare soil moisture data derived from the
different satellites. This is because the characteristics of the various sensors and scientific
algorithms may differ significantly. Also, there
are as yet no internationally agreed standards.
Nonetheless, the situation improves significantly
when systematic differences between the different satellite datasets are removed. Then it
becomes apparent that most satellite-derived
soil moisture products depict soil moisture
trends in space and time quite well. This has

also opened up the opportunity to merge soil
moisture data from active and passive microwave
instruments to create a long-term soil moisture
record, as has been done within the framework
of ESA’s Climate Change Initiative (see www.
esa-soilmoisture-cci.org/).

Until a few years ago satellite soil moisture products had only been available off-line with a data
latency of, at best, a few days. This changed with
the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT), which
is an active microwave sensor that has been
flown on a series of Meteorological Operational
(METOP) satellites since late 2006. ASCAT soil
moisture data are processed and disseminated
fully operationally in two stages:
•

The European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT)
generates 25-km ASCAT surface soil moisture
data in near-real time within the framework

By filtering the ASCAT surface soil moisture
time series with an exponential filter, the
so-called ASCAT Soil Water Index (SWI) is
derived, which is an estimate of the moisture
content in the soil profile down to a depth
of about 0.5 m. Daily ASCAT SWI data are
available on a regular global grid through
the global land monitoring service of the
European Copernicus (formerly GMES)
programme.

Both the ASCAT surface soil moisture and SWI
data products are freely accessible and can be
used by operational and scientific users alike to
study weather- and climate-related soil moisture
patterns.
