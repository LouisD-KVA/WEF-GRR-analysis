Annual Economic Report 2019: Editorial

The year in review
It was perhaps too good to be true. In 2017, it was unusual to see a synchronised
global expansion at rates above estimates of potential so late in the upswing and,
moreover, to project it to continue well into the future. Some deceleration was on
the cards. But when it came, in the second half of 2018, it appeared much stronger
than expected. It caused tremors in financial markets and anxiety about a possible
impending recession. Faced with the prospect of a weaker economy and with an
abrupt tightening of financial conditions, the major central banks put the very
gradual monetary policy tightening on pause. The recession has not materialised.
Still, as always, the question everyone is asking is: “What next?”
Looking back, decomposing global output into its components – a purely
accounting exercise – provides some insight into the factors behind the slowdown.
In the second half of the year, global trade came to a halt, manufacturing
decelerated and investment lost pace. By comparison, services and consumption
held up relatively well, propping up the expansion.
But while it is straightforward to identify the accounting categories behind the
slowdown, it is much harder to identify the underlying forces at work. That said, it is
possible to point to a number of cross-currents.
Multiple forces exerted downward pressure on growth. First, quite prominently,
political factors left their imprint on the economy and weighed on the minds of
economic decision-makers. Besides some country-specific political factors, trade
tensions loomed large. Doubtless, related uncertainty and concerns inhibited
activity, especially investment. Second, China slowed as the authorities sought to
bring about the much needed deleveraging of the economy to make growth more
sustainable. Given China’s heft and tight interconnections in the global economy,
the slowdown quickly spread around the world. Global value chains acted as a
powerful transmission channel. Third, financial conditions tightened somewhat in
parts of the world as US monetary policy continued to normalise until late 2018
and the US dollar strengthened. While holding up remarkably well by past
standards, emerging market economies (EMEs) came under some pressure, given
the heavy reliance of their firms on dollar financing. Finally, in several advanced
small open economies and a number of EMEs, financial cycles – best captured by
the joint behaviour of credit and property prices – appeared to shift from expansion
to contraction, weighing down on expenditures.
The slowdown would have been sharper without resilience elsewhere that
served to buffer weakness from manufacturing and trade. One supporting factor
was the continued strength of labour markets, accompanied by a modest pickup in
wage growth. Employment expanded further, pushing unemployment rates to
multi-decade lows in several economies. Other than in economies where the
housing market began to falter, consumption was thus a relative strength. Another
factor, at work in some of the large economies at the heart of the Great Financial
Crisis (GFC), was the financial cycle upswings, most notably in the United States.
In those cases, the post-crisis household deleveraging provided room for the
corporate sector to re-leverage, to the point of creating some vulnerabilities (see
below).

At the time of writing (late May), financial markets have become jittery again,
especially owing to an intensification of trade tensions. Nevertheless, consensus
forecasts, while noting downside risks, continue to see a global economy in a soft
patch. The forces supporting the expansion are expected to prevail.
What, then, about the outlook and risks beyond the next few quarters? In
order to assess how the global economy might evolve over that horizon, it is useful
to identify the more systematic forces at work behind the business fluctuations we
have been seeing more generally – forces which were in evidence in the period
under review. These deeper forces can influence business fluctuations either directly
or indirectly, by affecting policy. After considering these forces, we evaluate possible
risks to the outlook before turning to policy considerations.

The longer-term forces at work
Four such key forces have arguably been at work, providing the backdrop for recent
developments.
The first force is the inflation process, which has been pivotal in determining
the monetary policy stance. Inflation has remained very subdued despite many
economies operating close to, or above, standard estimates of economic potential
and with record low unemployment. Much ink has been spilt over this surprising
development. Some, like us, have for a long time stressed globalisation and
technological advances. In addition, demographics-induced changes in the labour
force may have led to underestimates of economic slack. What is clear is that labour
has been struggling to regain the bargaining power lost over the past decades. And
while wages have finally been responding more clearly to tighter labour markets,
firms have shown little sign of reacquiring pricing power. For instance, even as
wages have been rising faster than productivity in many countries, prices have not
kept up.
Less appreciated is the fact that ever since inflation has been low and stable,
starting some three decades ago, the nature of business fluctuations has changed.
Until then, it was sharply rising inflation, and the subsequent monetary policy
tightening, that ushered in downturns. Since then, financial expansions and
contractions have played a more prominent role.
Which brings us to the second force: finance and its role in the economy. The
GFC was just the most spectacular instance of this role. This justifies the greater
attention policymakers now pay to financial markets, credit developments and real
estate prices. Moreover, in a financially highly integrated world, capital flows across
borders hold sway. And smaller economies are generally at the receiving end; hence
the high sensitivity of EMEs to global financial conditions.
The third force is productivity growth, or rather the lack thereof. Growth
accelerations of the type experienced in 2017 could only lead to sustained growth
at a new, higher pace if a level shift in productivity growth takes place. Productivity
growth has been on a marked downward trend in advanced economies as a
group for a long time. And the slowdown became more marked following the GFC.
The impaired financial system is likely to have played a role in impeding the
allocation of resources to their best use. And it is surely no coincidence that trade
has lagged behind output and that investment has been correspondingly weak.
Whatever the actual reasons, lower productivity growth is constraining sustainable
expansions, at least in the advanced economies, where the frontier for the rest of
the world is set.
The fourth force, of more recent vintage, is the political and social backlash
against the open international economic order that has grabbed all the news

headlines recently. The trade and political tensions in the period under review are
just the most glaring manifestation. By no means all of the recent slowdown can
be ascribed to trade conflicts and protectionism – the slowdown in trade and
productivity predates the retreat into protectionism in the last two years. However,
the sound and the fury of trade conflict and the associated uncertainty have
imparted a downward twist to the slowdown. Nor should we take the longer-term
challenges lightly. From a historical perspective, it is not unusual to see such
surges of sentiment in the wake of major economic shockwaves: the Great
Depression marked the end of the previous globalisation era. It is too early to tell
how this surge will evolve; but it will clearly be a force to contend with in the
years to come.

From the short-term to the medium-term outlook
If the four listed above are the deeper forces at work, then they should hold clues
to charting the future. Of these forces, political factors, in particular those related
to trade policies, will continue to cast a long if unpredictable shadow over the
world economy. In addition, the factors underlying productivity growth are slowmoving, providing the backdrop to business fluctuations. Therefore, perhaps the
forces that can be explored in more depth are finance and the inflation process.
And as one would expect of this institution, we focus on assessing possible financial
vulnerabilities and how they might play out under different conditions – our
comparative advantage.
It has been a long journey since the GFC for the global financial system. Yet the
imprint of the crisis is still discernible in how financial developments will be
influencing the evolution of the economy in the years ahead.
In many of the countries less affected by the GFC, financial expansions have
reached an inflexion point. As a group, these economies account for around one
third of global GDP. Private sector credit growth has slowed relative to GDP and, in
a number of cases, property prices have started to fall. After the strong credit
expansion, these countries are now saddled with historically high household debt
levels, and some with high corporate debt as well. A specific feature of EMEs has
been the rapid growth of FX debt, mostly in the corporate sector – although it has
not quite reached previous peaks in relation to GDP. Size-wise, the only systemic
economy in this group is China, where the authorities are engaged in the delicate
balance of deleveraging the economy without slowing down growth, adapting
policy as circumstances, including the trade tensions, evolve. If past experience is
anything to go by, the contraction phase of the financial cycles in this group of
countries is likely to continue, acting as a drag on growth.
Countries that were at the heart of the GFC, such as the United States and a
number of European economies, have tended to see marked differences at the
sectoral level. Household debt in relation to incomes has declined after a long
phase of balance sheet repair and is on a stronger footing. By contrast, the
corporate sector in some countries has shown clear signs of overheating. In these,
the overall financial expansion will remain a source of strength for the economy for
now.
Perhaps the most visible symptom of potential overheating is the remarkable
growth of the leveraged loan market, which has reached some $3 trillion. While
firms in the United States – and, to a lesser extent, the United Kingdom – have
accounted for the bulk of the issuance, holdings are spread out more widely. For
quite some time, credit standards have been deteriorating, supported by buoyant
demand as investors have searched for yield. Structured products such as

collateralised loan obligations (CLOs) have surged – reminiscent of the steep rise in
collateralised debt obligations that amplified the subprime crisis. Should the
leveraged loan sector deteriorate, the economic impact would depend on the
potential amplification mechanisms. These can run right through the banking
system, linked to unstable wholesale funding, and other parts of the financial
system that hold leveraged loans and CLOs, via price adjustments. The probability
of these factors taking effect is best assessed against the backdrop of the longerterm deterioration in credit quality of the corporate sector in some advanced
economies, visible in the concentration of the outstanding stock of securities in the
triple-B segment – just above non-investment grade (“junk” status).
The condition of the banking sector is, in some respects, paradoxical. Country
differences aside, it is much better capitalised thanks to the post-crisis regulatory
reforms. However, asset growth among the major banks has slowed sharply since
the GFC. Book equity growth has been similarly lacklustre. The slow growth of book
equity reflects, in part, banks’ chronically low profitability, particularly in many euro
area countries. This matters. Profits are the first line of defence against losses and,
as by far the primary source of capital, they are the foundation for banks’ ability to
lend and support the economy. Some of the reasons for low profitability can be
traced to legacies from the GFC and the macroeconomic environment, most
notably persistently and unusually low nominal interest rates. Others reflect more
structural factors, especially excess capacity in a number of key banking systems.
Looking ahead, a looming competitive threat to banks comes in the form of
the big techs. In this Annual Economic Report, we devote a special chapter to these
huge companies that have started making inroads in financial services, leveraging
the vast customer bases they have secured through their activities (eg social media,
e-commerce and search engines). Payments, retail lending, asset management and
even insurance have already seen deep incursions by these behemoths, whose
market capitalisation far exceeds that of banks. Drawing on their unique
combination of vast amounts of data, the power of networks and their diversified
activities (their “DNA”), these companies have the potential to make further thrusts
into financial services and bring about large efficiency gains. They represent a
wake-up call for banks, which need to raise their game in order to compete
effectively. But at the same time, the presence of big techs is giving rise to major
policy issues (see below).
The overall landscape is one of a global economy that has been unable to
jettison its debt-dependent growth model. Indeed, aggregate debt (public plus
private) in relation to GDP, while it plateaued in the past year, is much higher than
pre-crisis. At the same time, interest rates – nominal and real – remain historically
low, even as economies hover around estimates of potential. And financial
conditions in advanced economies, notably in the largest among them, remain
accommodative from a longer-term perspective. As a result, should the global
economy slow down at some point, it is hard not to imagine that the debt burden
would increase further.
Against this backdrop, the evolution of inflation plays a key role. Should
inflation start to rise significantly at some point, it would induce central banks to
tighten more. This could cause tensions in financial markets and put heavily
indebted borrowers – private and public – under pressure. Should inflation remain
subdued and below central banks’ objectives, despite their forceful attempts to
push it up, current economic conditions could continue. But this would also extend
risk-taking, increasing vulnerabilities.
Policymakers can successfully negotiate this terrain. But as the pause in the
monetary policy normalisation process indicates, the narrow path we described last
year has proved to be a winding one.

xii

BIS Annual Economic Report 2019

Policy considerations
A number of policy implications flow from this diagnosis. For clearer skies to appear,
the policy mix needs to be rebalanced. Higher sustainable growth can only be
achieved by reducing the reliance on debt and reinvigorating productive strength.
In the process, this would relieve some of the burden monetary policy has been
bearing since the GFC and avoid the expectation that this policy can be the engine
for sustainable growth. Its more appropriate role is that of a backstop, given that its
main focus is delivering price stability while supporting financial stability.
Indeed, since the GFC, monetary policy has found itself in a complex position.
After fighting the fires of the crisis, it took over – successfully – much of the burden
of supporting the recovery. But given the persistence of economic weakness and,
even later on, an inflation rate stubbornly below objectives, interest rates have been
kept unusually low for unusually long, and central bank balance sheets have
ballooned. As a result, the room for policy manoeuvre has narrowed considerably.
Moreover, the very low rates, which prevail even as economies are hovering around
potential, have contributed, in part, to some of the financial vulnerabilities we now
see.
As we discuss in more detail in the body of the Report, this points to the
possibility of some delicate intertemporal trade-offs. Depending on circumstances,
it is possible that actions that yield clear benefits in the near term may risk
generating costs in the longer term. One such example is the relationship between
low interest rates and short-term economic activity, on the one hand, and risktaking and debt accumulation over the longer run, on the other. Another is the
high sensitivity of financial markets to policy tightening once they have grown
dependent on prolonged monetary policy accommodation. In turn, both of these
factors can potentially reduce the future room for manoeuvre and complicate
normalisation. Central banks are fully aware of these delicate and complex tradeoffs. Central banks and other authorities have implemented policies to reduce the
possibility of adverse future outcomes. Notably, they have adopted far-reaching
financial sector reforms. So far, adverse outcomes have been avoided, but this does
not give licence for complacency, including with regard to monetary policy.
EME central banks have been contending for some time with a complex
environment, which is why we devote a special chapter to the evolution of monetary
policy frameworks in the emerging world. The specific challenge in this instance
results from the high sensitivity of these economies to global financial conditions:
waves of capital flows and exchange rate pressures can put a strain on these
countries’ balance sheets. As a result, much as when a number of advanced small
open economies pioneered inflation targeting, monetary policy practice in EMEs
has moved ahead of theory. Rather than strictly sticking to inflation targeting with
freely floating exchange rates, the vast majority have combined it to varying
degrees with foreign exchange intervention. And all of them have complemented it
with the active use of macroprudential measures. That way, they have gained a
measure of freedom to better reconcile price and financial stability over the
medium term. Questions remain about how to deploy and coordinate the various
instruments, adapting them to country-specific circumstances and avoiding some
of the pitfalls involved. At a more structural level, the key challenge is to develop
domestic financial systems so as to reduce the sensitivity to global financial
conditions in the first place.
The experience of EMEs showcases one way to achieve a more balanced policy
mix. This is having a strong prudential framework, with respect to both micro- and
macroprudential dimensions: dealing with individual institutions and the financial
system as a whole, respectively. With primary reference to the microprudential

BIS Annual Economic Report 2019

xiii

dimension: now that most of the post-crisis financial reforms are in place, the key
challenge is their full, timely and consistent implementation. In the process,
regulators and supervisors should resist unwarranted pressures to backslide and
weaken standards. Just as there is a business cycle and a financial cycle, there is also
a regulatory cycle. As the memories of the GFC fade, those pressures will intensify.
As regards the macroprudential dimension, a lot has been done to put in place fullfledged frameworks and to deploy and activate the tools. As discussed in detail in
last year’s Report, this is a very welcome development.
Appropriate fiscal policies can also help achieve a more balanced policy mix. In
countries where sustainability is in danger, the objective should be to bring public
finances under control, to avoid fiscal dominance and limit risks to the financial
system. But where fiscal space is available, it should be used judiciously to boost
sustainable growth and, if the need arises, to support aggregate demand. Suitable
measures include, in particular, making the tax system and expenditures more
growth-friendly, not least through well chosen infrastructural investments where
productive opportunities exist. Reducing the bias of the tax system in favour of
debt is an obvious example. In doing all this, it is important to avoid the trap of
carrying out procyclical policies. One reason why public sector debt-to-GDP ratios
have been increasing at the global level is precisely the asymmetrical use of fiscal
policy, increasing deficits during contractions but failing to consolidate during
expansions. Hence the reduced room for policy manoeuvre compared with precrisis.
But the most important set of policies is structural. Hard as it is politically, it is
essential to revive the flagging efforts to implement policies designed to boost
growth. We have already discussed in previous Reports what those policies could
look like. In this year’s Report, the analysis of the regulatory response to big techs’
inroads in finance offers rich material to examine more closely and concretely some
of the challenges involved. The objective is to ensure that one can reap the
potentially large benefits that such technological innovations can bring about while
managing the potential risks. This requires tackling delicate issues that range from
financial stability to competition and data privacy. At the core of this triangle is the
treatment of data, which the digital revolution has brought to the fore. Ensuring a
level playing field that promotes competition under an adequate regulatory
umbrella is key. Whatever the precise answer, it will require more than ever the
close cooperation of different authorities, both nationally and internationally.
The skies are not clear yet. The path is narrow and winding. But the means to
negotiate it exist. They should be deployed.

Key takeaways
•

Although global growth appears to have hit a soft patch late last year, the resilience of services and
buoyant labour markets bode well for the near term.

•

Risks remain on the horizon. Trade and manufacturing may slow further, especially if trade tensions
escalate. Deleveraging in some major emerging market economies, weak bank profits in advanced
economies and high corporate debt may all act as a drag on growth.

•

Normalising policy against this backdrop involves potential trade-offs: what is good for today need not
necessarily be good for tomorrow. More fundamentally, monetary policy cannot be the engine of growth.
A greater role for fiscal, structural and prudential policy would contribute more effectively to sustainable
growth.

Over the past 12 months, the global economy slowed down. After a robust upturn
that pushed global growth well above potential in 2017, growth was set to
moderate somewhat. As the year progressed, however, the slowdown exceeded
expectations. In late 2018, world trade growth weakened substantially and financial
markets dived. In response, the Federal Reserve and other major central banks put
the very gradual and anticipated tightening of monetary policy on pause. Financial
markets quickly rebounded and were supported by subsequent signs that economic
activity had firmed. The outlook, though, remained uncertain as a further escalation
of trade tensions unnerved financial markets in May.
The signs of resilience augur well for the near-term outlook. Services have held
up better than manufacturing and trade, while employment growth and solid wage
increases have underpinned consumption. Moreover, except in some, relatively small
economies, credit and financial conditions are still acting as tailwinds for economic
activity. Yet significant near-term risks remain. Notably, the trade and political
uncertainty that contributed to the global slowdown over the past year can flare up
again. And China’s much needed deleveraging could resume, again causing its
economy to slow with global implications. Looking further ahead, high levels of
private and public debt in many economies represent a macroeconomic vulnerability.
The room for policy manoeuvre to address these risks has narrowed since the
Great Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2007–09, and regaining it has proved harder than
originally thought. One example is monetary policy. After shoring up the economy
during the GFC, with other policies taking a back seat, central banks were
instrumental in supporting the subsequent recovery. While central banks succeeded,
an inflation rate stubbornly below objectives even with economies seemingly
operating close to potential has made it harder to proceed along the normalisation
path. In addition, after the prolonged period of plentiful accommodation, financial
markets have proved very sensitive to signs of policy tightening while some financial
vulnerabilities have emerged. As a result, intertemporal trade-offs have come to the
fore. The continuation of easy monetary conditions can support the economy, but
make normalisation more difficult, in particular through the impact on debt and
the financial system. The narrow normalisation path has become narrower.

To ensure sustainable growth, a more balanced policy mix is in order. Hard as
it is politically, the only way to promote sustainable growth is to redouble efforts
to implement structural reforms. These have been lagging in the last few years
except for the financial system, where prudential regulation and supervision have
been strengthened. Within sensible fiscal frameworks, using resources to boost
sagging public investment and making spending and taxation more efficient
should also help. And, needless to say, in a global economy tightly knitted together
through both the production (global value chains) and financial channels, the
reduction of trade tensions would provide a widespread and sustained boost to
growth and jobs.
The chapter first describes the key economic and financial developments over
the past year. It then discusses the main drivers of growth and financial vulnerabilities.
Finally, it elaborates on the difficult challenges monetary policy is facing.

The year under review
The global economy loses momentum
Overall, the past year was a good one for the world economy. Global growth (in
purchasing power parity terms) is estimated to have edged down to 3.7% in 2018,
from a cyclical high of 3.9% in 2017, slightly below expectations at the start of the
review period (Graph I.1, first panel).
Some slowdown was to be expected. Amid continuing very easy financial
conditions globally, growth in 2017 had been surprisingly strong and above
potential in an unusually large number of countries. Using conventional measures
of slack, several economies appeared to carry far more momentum into the future
than had been the case in previous business cycle expansions (see Box I.A in last
year’s Annual Economic Report). Indeed, unemployment rates in several advanced
economies had reached multi-decade lows, helping to cement a recovery in private
consumption. Fiscal policy had turned expansionary in many countries. And,
boosted by above-average business confidence, fixed capital investment had finally
accelerated, especially in advanced economies. As a result, global trade and
manufacturing output had rebounded sharply from the lows reached in 2016
(Graph I.1, second panel).1
As 2018 progressed, however, indications emerged that the slowdown was
deeper than private and official forecasters had projected. New export orders
continued to decline, and world trade growth came to a sudden stop towards yearend. Capital goods investment disappointed, especially in Europe, China and other
Asian emerging market economies (EMEs). Purchasing managers’ indices (PMIs) for
manufacturing moved lower – even pointing to a contraction in several economies
in early 2019 (Graph I.1, third panel). Consumption also slowed, but generally
proved considerably more resilient, helping to support services. In the second
quarter, there were some signs that activity had firmed somewhat in advanced
economies and that fiscal easing and other measures put in place by China’s
authorities had started to bear fruit. Unfortunately, at the time of writing (end of
May), sentiment was again hit by renewed trade tensions.
The timing and extent of the slowdown differed across major economies
and regions. In the United States, growth actually rose for 2018 as a whole, to an
estimated 2.9%, from 2.2% in 2017, not least owing to a strong tax-driven
procyclical fiscal expansion. It then weakened slightly towards year-end, broadly in
line with projections. In China, growth is estimated to have edged down from 6.7%
in 2017 to 6.6% in 2018. This outturn went hand in hand with a large unexpected

drop in fixed investment and a sizeable contraction in import growth. Given the
size of Chinese imports, these developments made a noticeable contribution to the
drop in world trade and growth.
The slowdown was deeper in the euro area, Japan and most EMEs than
elsewhere (Graph I.1, first and fourth panels). In the euro area, growth is estimated
to have fallen to 1.8% in 2018, around half a percentage point below the forecast at
the start of the review period, but still above potential. While the drops in world
trade and exports were a major force, a variety of country-specific factors weighed
on domestic demand. In Japan, declining exports and natural disasters pushed
growth down to 0.8%, despite the partial offset of stronger than expected
investment.
Driven by slumping exports and lower investment, growth in EMEs outside
China also disappointed (Graph I.1, first panel). As the dollar reversed course and
started appreciating in early 2018, financial conditions tightened somewhat in EMEs
– a development that may have further weakened manufacturing activity and trade
(third panel). The sharpest tightening occurred in the most vulnerable EMEs,
typically those with larger current account deficits and greater reliance on foreign
funding. Turkey and Argentina suffered a currency crisis and sharp output
contractions. Yet contagion to other EMEs remained limited.
As the outlook deteriorated and uncertainty rose, growth projections were
marked down significantly, pushing them closer to or slightly below estimates of

potential (Graph I.1, fourth panel). Global growth was expected to slow to 3.4% in
2019, half a percentage point lower than forecast at the start of the review period.
The largest revision concerned EMEs excluding China. Elsewhere, including the
United States and China, revisions were smaller (first panel). Most revisions, even
small ones, were accompanied by statements highlighting an unusual concentration
of downside risks.

Financial markets go through large swings
As global trade growth slowed and downside risks grew, equity and corporate
bond markets experienced sharp losses, initially in October and then again in
December. Until then, financial conditions in the United States had remained
easy by historical standards, notably as reflected in a long rally in the stock market
and narrowing risk spreads against the backdrop of unusually low interest rates
(Graph I.2). This had occurred despite the continued tightening by the Federal
Reserve. By contrast, in the first half of 2018, financial conditions had actually
tightened in EMEs (first panel).
The causes of the market slump, while not entirely clear, can be traced to a
number of factors. Evidence based on stock returns indicates that earnings
expectations fell while uncertainty surrounding them rose substantially; and that
the future course of monetary policy and high corporate debt may also have played
a role (see Box I.A for further details). In the euro area, the deterioration of the
growth outlook was more evident, and so was its adverse impact on an already
fragile banking sector. Price-to-book ratios fell further from already depressed
levels, reflecting increasing concerns about banks’ health (Graph I.2, fourth panel).

Major central banks reacted to a deteriorating outlook and tighter financial
conditions by easing their stance. The People’s Bank of China moved first by cutting
reserve requirements several times as of mid-2018 (Graph I.3, first panel) and
introducing measures to help banks refinance and support small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs). After hiking the policy rate three times from March and having
its balance sheet run off at a predetermined pace, the Federal Reserve eventually
moved late in the year, signalling that its tightening cycle was nearer the end
than previously expected. Initially, in December, it gave indications about the policy
rate and, following the sharp tightening of financial conditions, about its balance
sheet in January and finally March. The ECB announced in March 2019 that it would
keep reference rates unchanged at least until the end of the year – a six-month
extension – and that it would renew its long-term refinancing operations (LTROs)
for banks, albeit on potentially less generous terms than previously. The Bank of
Japan further eased its very accommodative stance. In response to these shifts in
monetary policy, forward interest rates in major economies moved down (Graph I.3,
second panel).
Several other economies also adopted a more accommodative stance. As
external conditions weakened, central banks in advanced small open economies
and EMEs put planned policy rate increases on hold or even cut rates (Graph I.3,
third panel).
Monetary policy easing was facilitated by the rather surprising continued
absence of significant inflationary pressures in most economies. As oil prices fell
from mid-2018 to early 2019, headline inflation in both advanced and emerging
market economies declined towards core inflation. In advanced economies, core
inflation continued to hover at or below inflation targets (Graph I.3, fourth panel).
Its stability partly reflected the persistent lack of strong unit labour cost pressures:
tighter labour markets did boost real wage growth, but this hardly exceeded

Box I.A

What drove US financial market volatility in late 2018?

In October and, after a brief respite, again in December 2018, US equity prices fell sharply and corporate bond
spreads decompressed. Moreover, corporate issuance declined and bond and loan funds experienced outflows,
unusually large ones in December. What were the causes of market volatility? Were external developments more
important than domestic ones? How important were expectations of monetary policy? To answer these questions,
the analysis in this box follows three distinct approaches: it compares the dynamics of US equity valuations with
those of its possible drivers; it examines differences in stock returns on firms with high exposures to major countries
to illustrate the importance of global connections; and it evaluates whether the co-movement between stock returns
and either growth expectations or funding costs was unusually high in January, especially for riskier and more
leveraged firms.
The decline in the US stock market in October and December can be traced primarily to a downgrade in
growth expectations and a rise in earnings uncertainty (Graph I.A, left-hand panel). The fall in US growth
expectations was particularly large by historical standards in October. The rise in earnings uncertainty was also
sizeable, especially in December. Expectations of further monetary policy tightening played a key role late in the
year, but had a more limited impact on stocks in October, as suggested by the muted response of equity prices to
policy announcements. For example, on 3 October when, in addition to positive macroeconomic data releases, the

Fed signalled that policy rates were still some distance away from a neutral level, 10-year sovereign yields rose by
10 basis points on the day but equity prices did not budge.
The weakening global economy and its potential impact on US growth seem to have been a key factor behind
declining growth expectations and rising earnings uncertainty. Indeed, firms with large direct and indirect exposures
to China lost more than their peers (Graph I.A, centre panel). Indirect links appear to have been particularly
important: US firms exposed to Germany lost about the same as German firms exposed to China. Concerns about
Germany were, in turn, likely to have been amplified by weakness in other German export markets, including Turkey.
Coinciding with persistent growth risks overseas, the rise in US earnings uncertainty in December was quite large
relative to historical patterns (left-hand panel).
In addition, concerns intensified that monetary policy might be insufficiently flexible in responding to the
deteriorating corporate and growth outlook. Bond spreads for US high-yield companies rose much more in
December than in October (roughly 100 versus 60 basis points), with outflows from bond and loan funds and a
sizeable rise in overall spreads by historical standards (Graph I.A, bars in left-hand panel). Moreover, a measure of
tail risk for US equities advanced quickly in the week leading to the December Federal Open Market Committee
meeting, before retreating shortly afterwards. This contrasts with muted equity tail risks in October, when actual
volatility rose (dots in left-hand panel). At the same time, unease about the economic outlook rose in December,
as reflected in the elevated volatility of growth-sensitive equities prior to important macroeconomic data
announcements.
The rally in risky assets in early 2019, after the shift in US monetary policy outlook, seems to have owed to
both improved growth expectations and lower funding costs. The response of the broader stock market to these
factors was roughly in line with historical patterns (Graph I.A, right-hand panel). However, for utilities firms, which
tend to be highly leveraged, lower funding costs proved the key driver of returns. By the end of May, the S&P was
6% short of its mid-September 2018 peak, and corporate spreads had retraced about one third of their increase
between early October and end-2018.

 Growth expectations are measured as the difference between returns on stocks whose value responds more strongly to the economic
outlook (growth stocks), eg electronics, and returns on stocks that remain more stable through the business cycle (consumer staple stocks),
eg household goods. Similarly, country-specific growth expectations are measured with the return difference between growth and
consumer staple stock indices that include local companies.     The two measures quantify risk in different ways. The Chicago Board
Options Exchange Skew index uses prices of options on the S&P 500 that insure against tail risk. Preannouncement volatility reflects
uncertainty about the economic data that are about to be released. When economic uncertainty is high, stocks more sensitive to the
economic outlook (growth stocks) tend to be relatively more volatile before macroeconomic announcements.

productivity growth. Moreover, firms appear to have absorbed increases in unit
labour costs by accepting smaller profit margins or by cutting other costs (see Box I.B
for further details).
Following the easier policy stance, financial markets rebounded in early 2019.
Stock markets initially recouped most of their previous losses, but retreated
somewhat in May as trade tensions again intensified (Graph I.2). On the back of
lower expected policy rates, yield curves continued to flatten in major economies
(Graph I.4, first panel). Investment grade corporate spreads, especially in the
United States, narrowed closer to pre-crisis benchmarks. And after end-2018, highyield spreads dropped again below pre-crisis averages. Following an initial
depreciation around the turn of the year, the US dollar strengthened, approaching
levels prevailing in early 2017 (second panel). In EMEs, foreign currency spreads
fell to levels seen in mid-2018 (third panel) and capital flows briefly resumed
(fourth panel).
At the time of writing (end of May), financial markets were jittery about
escalating trade and geopolitical tensions. With investors’ risk appetite
diminishing, yield curves in advanced economies flattened further at the end of
May and portfolio flows into EMEs again showed signs of weakening. That said,
looking through short-term market volatility, financial conditions remained easy
by historical standards, especially in the United States and other advanced
economies.

Drivers of growth
Recent developments raise several important questions. Why did growth slow more
than expected? What forces were at work? How likely is it that growth could slow
further? Answering these questions is inevitably hard.2 Even so, it is possible to
identify a number of factors that have been at play in the past year and some
vulnerabilities that could at some point contribute to a future slowdown.
Outcomes in the year under review appear to have reflected the interaction of
contrasting forces. Some forces – which obviously prevailed – slowed the expansion.
One such force was growing economic and political uncertainty and downside risks
linked primarily to trade tensions and country-specific developments. Another,
temporary force was the weakness in the global demand for electronics. Yet, a more
important one was Chinese authorities’ much needed efforts to contain leverage
and to pursue a structural rebalancing of the economy towards consumption-driven
growth – efforts whose near-term effects on economic activity were compounded
by rising trade-related concerns. Given China’s size and tight links with the rest of
the world, weakness in that country quickly spread around the globe. Global value
chains played a key role, possibly also through a tightening of financial conditions
associated with the further appreciation of the dollar – a tightening that no doubt
weighed on EMEs more generally. Besides China, some smaller economies that had
been less affected by the GFC began to feel the drag of turning financial cycles, but
given their size the impact should have had contained global repercussions.
Other forces helped buttress global demand. In particular, the relative resilience
of consumption drew strength from buoyant labour markets as employment
increased further and wage growth picked up. Moreover, in some of the larger

Why has inflation remained low despite rising wages?

Over the past year, wage growth has finally gained some strength, especially in the United States, Japan and
Germany where the cycle is now mature and official unemployment rates close to record lows. Albeit timidly, wage
inflation is responding to tighter slack in the economy, suggesting that conventional wage Phillips curves are still a
valid benchmark. That said, current wage inflation has yet to translate into higher consumer price inflation. Why
has the transmission been so muted thus far?
The evolution of real wage growth relative to productivity gains holds part of the answer. In the recent years,
growth in labour compensation came mostly on the back of productivity gains (Graph I.B, left-hand panel); once
these are accounted for, real (inflation-adjusted) compensation per unit of product has hardly increased. Recent
developments seem unlikely to reverse this trend. The share of income that accrues to labour has been on a
declining path in many countries, reflecting to a large extent a continued erosion of workers’ bargaining power.
This phenomenon, which may have contributed to the flattening of the wage Phillips curve, owes to structural
factors that are unlikely to change in the near term. First, globalisation and the integration in the global economy of
China, India and the former Soviet bloc have increased the effective supply of labour and made labour markets
contestable, exposing workers to the threat of production relocation. Second, unionisation has steadily declined,
making it more difficult for workers to capture a larger share of productivity gains. Third, technological change
continues to shape the demand for labour. Automation of manufacturing processes has enabled firms to substitute
labour with capital and may now threaten even “high-quality” blue-collar jobs. Going forward, progress in the
application of artificial intelligence, advanced data analytics, cloud computing and other technological advances is
likely to also weaken the bargaining power of white-collar workers who have been spared so far. Fourth, a large
share of recent job creation has occurred in certain low productivity growth services sectors. This trend may continue
in the near term as economies become increasingly service-oriented. Finally, a higher retirement age has led in
recent years to an increase in the participation rate of older workers, whose wages are generally less sensitive to
slack than those of younger workers.
Another part of the answer reflects how firms adjust their profit margins or other costs. While strong in the
1970s and 1980s, the correlation between the growth in unit labour costs (ULCs) and contemporaneous and
subsequent price inflation has weakened considerably in the most recent period (Graph I.B, centre panel). This
disconnect is also visible in another well documented finding – the flattening of the price Phillips curve – and

mirrors the increase in the profit share (the counterpart of a lower labour share). With larger margins, firms should
have more room than in the past to absorb fluctuations in ULCs.
However, from a theoretical perspective it is unclear whether profit margins should necessarily decrease in
response to demand pressures, hence making the price Phillips curve flatter than its wage counterpart. Indeed, if
wages are “stickier” than prices – as it is normally the case – profit margins should increase when demand grows. Yet
firms may also decide to reduce their margins in an upswing to gain market share. For highly indebted firms or
firms with difficult access to credit, financial factors may also play a role: in a downturn, such firms may be reluctant
to lower prices to avoid losing the cash needed to meet their financial obligations or new spending. This may
explain, for example, why inflation fell less than forecast during the GFC. Similarly in an upswing, firms may take
advantage of easy credit conditions to moderate price increases and hence strengthen their customer base.
Empirical evidence on the cyclicality of profit margins tends to be inconclusive (Graph I.B, right-hand panel).
Accepting a reduction in margins is not the only way firms may respond to rising ULCs. Firms can alternatively
change the quality and composition of their products or cut other costs. For example, in certain sectors such as the
retail fashion industry, firms are increasingly using “quantum pricing”. They design their products to match a small
number of prices. And when production costs change, they may choose to redesign their product lines (eg adjust
the quality or composition of their products) rather than changing their quantum prices. This illustrates how the
pricing (and marketing) policies of part of the corporate sector may have become far more complex than what is
assumed by mainstream macroeconomic models.
All in all, there remains considerable uncertainty as to when and how far current labour market tightness will
translate into price inflation. But it is clear that muted inflation pressures from increasingly tight labour markets are
no boon for monetary policy. Weaker cyclical pressures can enable idiosyncratic factors to drag inflation rates below
target, which may eventually lead long-term expectations to drift down. Counteracting this would require the
continuation or even a further strengthening of the accommodative stance. But this would put a stop to
normalisation, preventing the rebuilding of policy space to face the next downturn and potentially raising significant
intertemporal trade-offs (see below).

economies that had been hard hit by the GFC, the subsequent deleveraging of the
household sector meant that, in aggregate, financial cycle expansions remained a
source of strength.
These contrasting forces go a long way towards explaining the patterns that
characterised the slowdown. The trade-intensive manufacturing sector weakened
more than services, investment suffered more than consumption, and the United
States held up better than China, the euro area and a number of EMEs.
Looking ahead, the balance of these forces could help sustain the expansion
further. Still, some risks remain. The factors that slowed growth have not gone away

and might intensify. And a number of financial vulnerabilities could act as a drag if the
economy weakened. These relate primarily to corporate balance sheets, household
balance sheets in some of the smaller economies, and weak bank profitability in a
number of advanced economies. Underlying several of these vulnerabilities is the
continued overdependence of the economic expansion on very accommodative
monetary conditions and higher debt, globally, compared with pre-crisis.

Confidence and uncertainty
Over the past year, business and consumer confidence retreated steadily from their
cyclical highs (Graph I.5, first panel). Lingering trade tensions, especially between
China and the United States, dampened business sentiment, in part due to concerns
about a possible escalation of tariff hikes (second panel). In addition to clouding
future demand and fixed investment prospects, the trade tensions raised questions
about the viability of existing supply chain structures and, more generally, about
the future of the global trading system.
But trade tensions were not the only factor sapping confidence. In Europe,
fiscal stress in Italy, problems with auto emission testing in Germany, street protests
in France and the possibility of a disruptive Brexit also contributed. These factors
are likely to have dampened growth expectations and made future growth more
uncertain – hence, for instance, the increased dispersion of growth forecasts around
the turn of the year (Graph I.5, third panel). A more vulnerable global economy, in
turn, increased corporate earnings uncertainty in the United States and other major
economies (Box I.A). Existing measures suggest that higher uncertainty and lower

business confidence have historically coincided with reduced investment activity
(Graph I.5, fourth panel).

China’s deleveraging
As the review period confirmed, China continues to face a deleveraging challenge.
The authorities are engaged in a delicate, in fact unprecedented, balancing act.
They are seeking to ensure a smooth transition to a service-based economy and to
reduce the serious macroeconomic risks linked to an outsize financial boom while
maintaining overall economic growth on a satisfactory path.
Over the past year, the authorities took further measures designed to restrict
shadow banking and, more generally, to deleverage the economy. These measures
constrained, in particular, local government spending and the activity of SMEs, which
over the past decade had largely relied on shadow banking finance. Partly as a result,
SMEs saw their working capital and profitability decline sharply (Box I.C). Policymakers
also took further measures to restrict bank lending to highly polluting and excess
capacity industries. These decisions, while much needed from a longer-term
perspective, no doubt depressed investment and economic activity in the near term,
adding to the woes from large debt overhangs. Firm-level data suggest that, beyond
a certain threshold, firms that have accumulated more debt tend to be relatively less
productive, reflecting past credit misallocation (Graph I.6, left-hand panel). Naturally,
trade tensions exacerbated these problems, especially for the export-oriented sectors.
The decline in credit growth to non-financial businesses was offset by a further
increase in household and on-budget government debt. As a result, the nonfinancial sector debt-to-GDP ratio – a measure of leverage – was broadly unchanged
(Graph I.6, centre panel). That said, the shift in the composition of debt may, on

Deleveraging and SME financing in China

A key objective of Chinese regulatory authorities has been to reduce corporate leverage and, by extension, the size
of the shadow banking sector. This sector’s rapid expansion between 2009 and 2016 was mainly bank-funded. Small
and medium-sized banks such as joint-stock and city commercial banks played a key role, as they tried to circumvent
regulations and extend credit through special off-balance sheet vehicles, trust funds and brokers. During this period,
growth in the liabilities of these banks, which account for around one third of total banking system assets,
consistently outpaced that of aggregate financing for the real economy (Graph I.C, left-hand panel).
Measures taken by authorities have stabilised growth in the shadow banking sector, but at the cost of
tightening financial conditions. Privately owned small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) were particularly
affected. The reduction in shadow bank lending has stretched smaller banks’ lending capacity, as many previously
off-balance sheet risky assets have been brought back onto balance sheets. These banks primarily serve SMEs, while
the larger ones provide credit to large state-owned firms (Graph I.C, centre panel).
The economic slowdown and rising trade tensions exacerbated the plight of SMEs, including a large number of
manufacturing firms. Detailed data on SME performance are not available. However, the latest financial data for listed
firms show that while the proportion of non-financial firms reporting losses in 2018 increased across the board, it was
small-cap companies and manufacturers that suffered most (Graph I.C, right-hand panel). The effect is macroeconomically
significant: the fall in profits for the smallest category of firms erased 0.2 percentage points of GDP growth. Further,
this group saw close to a 40% fall in market cap in 2018, one and a half times that of the market as a whole. This
reflected growing concerns about future profitability and, by extension, firms’ financial health, given high debt.
Chinese authorities have responded to these developments by encouraging banks to increase their lending to
SMEs. Measures adopted by the People’s Bank of China since June 2018 include increasing the central bank’s quota
of refinancing and rediscounted loans to smaller banks. Moreover, the authorities have incentivised lending to SMEs
by using the level of such lending as the basis for lowering reserve requirements and providing access to a new
central bank facility for loans of up to three years. In April 2019, the government also cut the value added tax rate
that applies to sales of goods in the manufacturing sector from 16% to 13%. The effects of these measures started
to show in Q1 2019, as total outstanding bank loans to small and micro enterprises rose by 19% year on year, more
than 5 percentage points above the growth rate of other loans.

balance, have slowed growth. Estimates using provincial-level data suggest that,
unlike business loans, consumer loans do not have a discernible impact on GDP in
the first year, and reduce it after three years (right-hand panel). This is probably
because consumers use credit mainly to purchase residential property, whereas
firms use it for fixed investment.

Trade and global value chains
As China slowed, partly contributing to the slowdown in the euro area – another
major trading powerhouse – global trade took a hit. Countries that trade more
intensively with both economies tended to experience a larger drop in
manufacturing activity and new export orders (Graph I.7, left-hand and centre
panels). To some extent, the fall reflected a decline in intermediate goods transacted
within global value chains (right-hand panel). For example, for Chinese Taipei and
Korea, intermediate goods account for 76–81% of all exports to China.
The effects of the slowdown on trade were probably amplified by tighter
financial conditions in EMEs, in part owing to the US dollar’s tendency to appreciate
in 2018. Around 80% of global bank trade financing is denominated in dollars. In
several countries, not only are firms highly indebted (see below), but a large share
of their debt is denominated in dollars (Chapter II). Furthermore, long value chains
are highly dependent on external finance for working capital. For all these reasons,
activity in the value chains and trade is likely to be sensitive to a dollar appreciation.3
Such sensitivity is one factor that can help explain why the dollar and global trade
in manufacturing moved in sync during the review period (Graph I.1, second and
third panels).

(Graph I.8, left-hand panel). The resilience of consumption may also partly explain
why the services sector outperformed manufacturing. But structural factors have
probably also contributed: the composition of consumption has generally been
shifting towards services, albeit not uniformly across countries (centre panel).
In turn, these trends have supported job creation, given that the services sector
is labour-intensive. At the same time, digital technology has increasingly enabled
the provision of more services across borders. As a result, over the past four years,
employment shares in services have risen in both advanced and emerging market
economies (Graph I.8, right-hand panel). By contrast, the employment shares in
manufacturing have generally declined.

Financial cycles
The dilemma Chinese policymakers have been facing is just an instance of a broader
phenomenon. Since the mid-1980s, medium-term fluctuations in credit and property
prices – in short, financial cycles – have grown in duration and amplitude and have
become a more important determinant of business fluctuations (see Box I.B in last
year’s Annual Economic Report). To be sure, such cycles differ in intensity across
countries and over time. And they depend fundamentally on policy. For instance,
the post-crisis financial reforms, by strengthening financial systems, have no doubt
muted their costs. But they all share some key dynamics. New credit and rising asset
prices tend to support aggregate demand and economic activity. But, over time,
the accumulation of debt raises debt service commitments, which can weigh down
persistently on the expenditures of indebted households and firms. Hence, once
the financial cycle turns, the positive effects of new credit give way to the negative
effects of debt servicing and declining asset prices on spending. As a result,
measures of financial cycle expansions have proved useful leading indicators of

subsequent economic downturns (Graph I.9, left-hand panel). Indeed, such measures
have been found to outperform yield curve variables as indicators of recession risk.4
Financial cycles need not be synchronised around the world. In fact, countries
currently find themselves in different phases. This can be illustrated with a simple
composite measure that combines the behaviour of credit and property prices. In
countries less affected by the GFC, where recessions had largely been imported via
trade, financial cycles continued to expand and now appear to have turned. This is
true not only of China but also of many EMEs and advanced small open economies
(Graph I.9, right-hand panel). All else equal, this suggests weaker demand in these
economies going forward and may already have been a factor behind their slowdown
over the past year. As a group, including China, these economies account for around
one third of global GDP. By contrast, in crisis-hit countries such as the United States
and some European countries, which had already seen a financial bust at the time,
the financial expansion is less mature, suggesting some support to global growth.
At the same time, sectoral differences are also apparent, in line with the
features of the pre-crisis financial expansion. In countries that were not at the heart
of the GFC, both household and corporate debt have continued to rise. In the
others, the household sector has deleveraged and resumed building up debt only
recently. But the corporate sector has generally leveraged further, in some cases to
the point of generating vulnerabilities.

Household debt and house prices
Household debt has reached new historical peaks in a number of economies that
were not at the heart of the GFC, and house price growth has in many cases stalled.

16

BIS Annual Economic Report 2019

For a group of advanced small open economies, average household debt amounted
to 101% of GDP in late 2018, over 20 percentage points above the pre-crisis level
(Graph I.10, left-hand panel). Moreover, household debt service ratios (DSRs),
capturing households’ principal and interest payments in relation to income,
remained above historical averages despite very low interest rates. In selected Asian
EMEs, household debt climbed to 69% of GDP, compared with 46% pre-crisis. Some
advanced economies, in particular Australia and to a lesser extent Sweden, have
already seen downward corrections in residential property prices (centre panel).
High household debt and anaemic or negative house price growth may already
have begun to weigh on private consumption in some of these countries. For
example, for the advanced small open economies that began to see a decline in
house prices, private consumption growth slowed on average by around half a
percentage point in 2018, including by over 1 percentage point in Canada and
Sweden. This is consistent with experience in recent years, which have seen a
relatively close correlation between growth in private consumption and residential
property prices in a broad sample of AEs and EMEs (Graph I.10, right-hand panel).
While in Asian EMEs private consumption has so far mostly proved resilient,
debt dynamics raise concerns about future debt servicing burdens and, by
extension, consumption. In Korea, where data on household debt servicing costs
are available, the household DSR has evolved similarly to that in advanced small
open economies (Graph I.10, red lines in the left-hand panel).
By contrast, following the post-crisis deleveraging, household balance sheets
proved to be a source of strength in the economies that had been at the core of
the crisis. Household debt-to-GDP ratios there generally remained below pre-crisis
levels. Thus, rising house prices combined with strong labour markets supported

consumption and growth (Graph I.10, centre panel). Given the size of these
economies, developments there go a long way in explaining why global consumption
growth held up relatively well. That said, private consumption did show signs of
slowing towards late 2018 even in some core economies in the euro area.

Vulnerabilities from high corporate debt
Even after retreating somewhat, corporate leverage remained close to historical
highs in many regions. In the United States in particular, the ratio of debt to earnings
in listed firms was above the previous peak in the early 2000s (Graph I.11, first panel).
Leverage in emerging Asia was still higher, albeit below the level immediately
preceding the 1990s crisis. Moreover, lending to leveraged firms – ie those borrowing
in either high-yield bond or leveraged loan markets – has become sizeable. In 2018,
leveraged loan issuance amounted to more than half of global publicly disclosed
loan issuance (loans excluding credit lines).
High indebtedness makes firms more vulnerable to a possible tightening of
financial conditions, regardless of the source. Even in an environment of continuing
very low interest rates, financial conditions could tighten substantially if earnings
faltered. The strong outflows from bonds and loan funds and the sharp widening of
AE and EME spreads in late 2018 illustrate how fast markets can shift (Box I.A).
Market characteristics can influence the extent to which financial conditions
respond to a deteriorating business environment. In particular, following a longterm decline in credit quality since 2000, the share of issuers with the lowest
investment grade rating (including financial firms) has risen from around 14% to

45% in Europe and from 29% to 36% in the United States.5 Given widespread
investment grade mandates, a further drop in ratings during an economic
slowdown could lead investors to shed large amounts of bonds quickly. As mutual
funds and other institutional investors have increased their holdings of lower-rated
debt, mark-to-market losses could result in fire sales and reduce credit availability.
The share of bonds with the lowest investment grade rating in investment grade
corporate bond mutual fund portfolios has risen, from 22% in Europe and 25% in
the United States in 2010 to around 45% in each region (Graph I.11, second panel).
How financial conditions might respond depends also on how exposed banks
are to collateralised loan obligations (CLOs). Banks originate more than half of
leveraged loans and hold a significant share of the least risky tranches of CLOs. Of
these holdings, US, Japanese and European banks account for around 60%, 30%
and 10%, respectively. In general, banks are likely to face lower losses from direct
securitisation exposures and should be in a better position to manage them than in
the 2006–07 subprime crisis, given the reform-induced stronger capital and liquidity
cushions. That said, the concentration of exposures in a small number of banks may
result in pockets of vulnerability. CLO-related losses could reveal that the searchfor-yield environment has led to an underpricing and mismanagement of risks. In
turn, this could generate dynamics that would bring banks’ direct and indirect
exposures to the fore. All else equal, more vulnerable would be banks that have
extended credit lines to leveraged borrowers, have links with asset managers active
in the CLO market, find it hard to accumulate loss-absorbing capital (eg because of
profitability issues), and/or depend on short-term (eg FX swap) funding markets.
Tighter financial conditions could dampen investment, amplifying any
slowdown. The effect would tend to be larger in countries where firms are more
leveraged, play a larger role in investment, are more exposed to commercial
property price (and hence collateral-value) declines, and borrow in foreign currency.
Econometric evidence suggests that, following a slowdown, investment by highyield financed firms drops by twice as much as that of other firms (Graph I.11, third
panel). In the United States, during 2015–17, as much as 40% of capital expenditures
took place in high-yield financed firms.6 Among economies with relatively high
corporate debt, commercial property prices have declined over the past year in
France, Sweden and the United States (Graph I.10, centre panel). And after years of
strong issuance in international markets, outstanding FX-denominated debt
securities issued by non-financial corporates amounted to $4 trillion at end-March
2019; of that total, around $850 billion is set to mature in the next two years.
Firms would be more vulnerable if inflation eventually rose and monetary policy
tightened substantially in response. While debt service ratios have been kept at bay
by low interest rates, rising debt has raised their sensitivity to policy rates. Estimates
for a panel of advanced economies suggest that high corporate debt service ratios
amplify any slowdown in output growth (Graph I.11, yellow line in fourth panel).
The continued increase in corporate debt has consequences also for the
aggregate productive potential of the economy. Firms that are unable to cover debt
servicing costs from operating profits over an extended period and that have muted
growth prospects – so-called zombie firms – have been on average 40% more
leveraged than their profitable counterparts.7 Since the 1980s their share has risen,
alongside the deterioration in banks’ perceived health, as reflected in price-to-book
ratios (Graph I.12, left-hand panel), and with declining interest rates (centre panel).8
Zombie firms currently make up around 6% of non-financial listed firms and account
for 2.5% of their capital stock.9 They sap economy-wide productivity growth not
only by being less productive themselves, but also because they crowd out resources
available to more productive firms. Evidence suggests that their increase over time
has had an economically significant macroeconomic impact (right-hand panel).10

Banks’ condition
Banks’ ability to support the economy, especially in a downturn, depends on how
well capitalised and profitable they are. Thanks to the Basel III reforms, bank
capitalisation has increased substantially (Graph I.13, left-hand panel).11 As a large
body of evidence indicates, not only does a stronger capital base improve bank
stability,12 it also supports more lending.13 Moreover, as capital is significantly above
regulatory requirements, banks are also less likely to curtail lending to avoid
breaching them. Estimates suggest that capital buffers increased significantly from
the mid-2000s (right-hand panel). For the median large bank, the buffer rose from
some 3 to 5 percentage points between 2006 and 2017 (vertical lines).14
However, in order to support the economy, banks also need to be profitable. In
general, profits are the main source of capital increases, help raise external funding
at lower cost, and represent the first line of defence against losses. Hence,
sustainable profitability underpins resilient lending. Moreover, low profitability may
also lead to credit misallocation. Less profitable banks are more likely to evergreen
loans or lend to zombie firms, thereby crowding out funding for new, more
productive ones. In turn, over time, credit misallocation may depress bank profits
further, thus setting in motion a vicious cycle.
Unfortunately, bank profitability has been lacklustre. In fact, as measured, for
instance, by return-on-assets, average profitability across banks in a number of
advanced economies is substantially lower than in the early 2000s (Graph I.14, lefthand panel). Within this group, US banks have performed considerably better than
those in the euro area, the United Kingdom and Japan (centre panel). Looking
ahead, depressed market valuations, as reflected for instance in lower price-tobook ratios, suggest lingering concerns about long-term profitability. Furthermore,
the increase in capitalisation has occurred to a large degree owing to slower asset

growth (right-hand panel). Hence, going forward, weak profitability could potentially
constrain credit growth through slower equity accumulation.
Both macroeconomic and banking-specific factors have sapped bank
profitability. On the macro side, persistently low interest rates and low growth
reduce profits. Compressed term premia depress banks’ interest rate margins from
maturity transformation.15 Low growth curtails new loans and increases the share of
non-performing ones. Therefore, should growth decline and interest rates continue
to remain low following the pause in monetary policy normalisation, banks’
profitability could come under further pressure.16
To improve profitability, banks face challenges. Costs remain stubbornly high
relative to income. Business models have yet to be restructured on a sustainable
basis – in particular, adapting to a lower and flatter yield curve. Banks are also
facing increasing competition from non-traditional players, such as big techs, which
are taking advantage of digital innovation (Chapter III). Those banks saddled with
antiquated legacy IT systems are more vulnerable. Furthermore, overcapacity
lingers, as bank exit is much harder than in other sectors.
The public sector can play a useful role in boosting bank profitability.
Authorities can demand tighter provisioning policies (eg via asset quality reviews).
Such policies may facilitate the task of addressing enduring non-performing loans,17
which weigh on bank valuations, especially in some euro area jurisdictions.18 The
authorities can also improve the resolution mechanism to facilitate orderly exit.
Removing obstacles from cross-border mergers could similarly help consolidation.
Finally, the public sector could implement much needed growth-boosting structural
reforms and, in economies with limited fiscal space, could maintain fiscal discipline
so as to avoid putting the banking system at risk.
Similar questions about the resilience of bank lending arise in the context of FX
funding. International banks intermediate substantial foreign currency funds. Most

of these are denominated in US dollars, and a sizeable portion in euros. In addition,
a large share of FX funding takes place through FX swaps and is not captured on
balance sheets.19 Given the dominant role of the US dollar in the international
banking system, as the GFC showed, dollar funding can easily come under pressure
at times of stress.20 This puts a premium on appropriate backstop mechanisms.

Monetary policy challenges
The challenges monetary policy is facing today are best understood against the
backdrop of the GFC’s long shadow. Not only did central banks prevent the
economy from falling into a tailspin as the crisis broke out, they also took the lead
in establishing the basis for the subsequent recovery, as other policies did not
provide sufficient support. And they did so successfully, supporting the economy’s
return to potential. In the process, inflation rates have for years remained below
target for the main advanced economies, even when economies have been
operating with limited spare capacity. Faced with these conditions and the puzzling
behaviour of inflation, central banks could keep policy accommodative for some
time, both in terms of interest rates and in terms of the size and composition of
their balance sheets. Policy rates had previously never been negative in nominal
terms in major economies, and they have now been negative in real (inflationadjusted) terms for even longer than during the Great Inflation era. And balance
sheets have seen an unprecedented expansion.
Central banks have been responsive in the rapidly evolving context. In the year
under review, the uncertainties in the global economy, notably related to the trade
tensions, and the sensitivity of financial markets have induced a pause in the
monetary policy normalisation process in advanced economies. Nevertheless,
central banks find themselves in a predicament, as the path ahead has narrowed.
On the one hand, the room for policy manoeuvre has shrunk substantially since the

22

BIS Annual Economic Report 2019

GFC. Tackling a downturn or a further downward slide in inflation would stretch
monetary policy further. This puts a premium on regaining policy space by
proceeding along a tightening path. On the other hand, with subdued inflation,
signs of weakening economic activity have made it hard for central banks to
continue along that path, not least as it may risk de-anchoring inflation expectations.
While ideally inflation convergence on the back of sustained growth would open
the way to tightening policy gradually and steadily, in practice persistently low
inflation and doubts about the resilience of economic growth have delayed it. And,
as the GFC has receded in time, financial vulnerabilities have built up.

Potential intertemporal trade-offs
All this has brought to prominence some delicate potential intertemporal policy
trade-offs. These would arise in those situations where policy actions have welcome
effects in the short run but raise the risk of unwelcome ones in the longer run.
Under normal conditions, this is not an issue. Reducing interest rates when inflation
is below target and output is depressed pushes them towards desirable levels. But if
inflation remains unresponsive and interest rates have to be kept low for long, then
financial vulnerabilities can build up and the room for policy manoeuvre can be
consumed. This takes policymakers outside their comfort zone and requires extra
care. Deciding the extent and pace of policy normalisation today exemplifies these
potential challenges. Central banks are fully aware of such trade-offs. Inevitably, a
good degree of judgment is needed. That is why decisions may differ across
countries and circumstances.
In such conditions, adopting a more gradual approach is justified on several
grounds.
First, the price stability mandate sets the stage. This naturally induces central
banks to maintain policy accommodation, or to ease further, when inflation is
below target, even when the economy appears to be close to estimates of potential.
And it constrains the policy options when such a policy could have unwelcome
effects on the financial side of the economy longer-term, such as by encouraging
excessive risk-taking.
Second, and closely related, such an approach can help bring inflation and
inflation expectations back towards target. This is especially relevant if the central
bank’s credibility is at stake. Succeeding in raising inflation would boost that
credibility and help preserve future policy space if it prevents expectations from
drifting downwards. Stabilising inflation around the target is seen as especially
important when policymakers consider that the equilibrium, or so-called “natural”,
interest rate has fallen for reasons that have little to do with their decisions.21
Finally, such an approach is quite compelling if financial markets or segments
of the financial system appear fragile. As suggested by the year under review,
markets can sometimes be quite sensitive to signs of higher rates or smaller central
bank balance sheets. Even in the context of benign market conditions, there is
evidence that changes in balance sheet policy can have non-negligible effects on
term premia (Box I.D). A sharp market reaction, and consequent outsize tightening
of financial conditions, could impact the economy adversely. Furthermore, in
economies with a relatively weak banking sector, the approach may reduce the risk
of banks running into funding problems and curtailing credit. And if it succeeds in
boosting output without raising debt burdens, it can support financial stability. The
higher the uncertainty about conditions in the financial system, and the macro
economy, the stronger the case for such a strategy.
At the same time, the gains from such a strategy could be associated with costs
in terms of risks to longer-term macroeconomic resilience and stability and the

The run-off of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet

Box I.D

In late 2017, almost two years after the first post-crisis hike in the federal funds rate, the Federal Reserve began to
reduce its balance sheet, which had grown to $4.5 trillion or 23% of GDP. To minimise the risk of disruptions to bond
markets and facilitate communication on the use of multiple instruments, the reduction has been carried out in a
gradual and preannounced manner.
A key question concerns its impact on interest rates and real activity. One view, shared by some economists and
policymakers, is that the impact should be small, unlike the documented sizeable effects of large-scale asset purchase
programmes (referred to as quantitative easing or QE). This conclusion relies on some key hypotheses. First,
changes in central bank reserves have no effect when financial markets are functioning properly and banks have easy
access to funding – that is, under these circumstances, portfolio rebalancing effects are small or negligible. Second,
the signalling effects of changes in the balance sheet also fade away once the policy rate is above its zero lower
bound and rising. The signalling channel works when the policy rate is at its zero lower bound by strengthening the
central bank’s commitment to keeping policy rates at the lower bound for longer than otherwise expected. An
opposite view is that portfolio balance effects remain economically significant even in the context of benign financial
market conditions. Indeed, several studies find support for this view based on data from the pre-crisis period, when
the maturity structure of public debt and hence the amount of duration risk absorbed by the market were influenced
by the fiscal authority’s debt management decisions. According to this view, long-term interest rates should be
affected post-crisis not only by the central bank’s balance sheet policies but also by the US Treasury’s issuance.
Against this backdrop, the analysis here examines the effects of changes in the balance sheet policy on term
premia using both event-study and regression analysis. The focus of the event study is on the period of quantitative
tightening (QT; defined here as December 2015 to March 2019). The exercise measures the impact of Federal Open
Market Committee (FOMC) announcements regarding its balance sheet policy on term premia within a two-day
window. The announcements are limited to windows in which there was no change in the fed funds rate. The
impact is then compared with the average effect observed over FOMC announcements when neither changes in
interest rate nor those in balance sheet policies were communicated. The differential impact can therefore be
attributed to balance sheet policy. The first event is September 2017, when the FOMC announced that the run-off
would start in October (Graph I.D, left-hand panel). The reaction of the term premia (blue bar) was mildly positive, as
a fraction of market participants were expecting a later start of the run-off. Afterwards, the FOMC communicated
changes in balance sheet policy in January (yellow bar) and March (purple bar) 2019. Both announcements positively
surprised the market in terms of the larger size of System Open Market Account (SOMA) holdings or earlier end of
the run-off, decreasing the term premia. In absolute value, these last two announcements induced statistically
significant, larger changes in the term premia relative to the average impact of announcements of no change in
either policy rates or the balance sheet (red bars). These results suggest that balance sheet policy can move financial
markets also in periods of QT.
A regression analysis offers additional evidence pointing to sizeable effects of changes in balance sheet policy
(alongside changes in debt management policy). It first converts the maturity structure of outstanding US Treasury
securities held in the market (outside the Federal Reserve) into a figure labelled the ten-year equivalent (TYE) – a
summary measure of the exposure of market participants to interest rate risk. The US 10-year term premium is
regressed on the TYE supply measure over the period March 1994–September 2017, using a number of controls.
The supply variable is interacted with a dummy indicator, which distinguishes QT periods from QE periods (the latter
defined here as November 2008–November 2015) and also pre-crisis periods. As shown in the centre panel, the
estimated impact of a reduction in the TYE supply of 10 percentage points of GDP is about 70 basis points during
periods of QE and 50 basis points in periods of QT. The difference between the effects is statistically significant. This
indicates an asymmetry in the impact of QT relative to QE, although a quantitatively small one.
Going forward, Treasury issuance should be expected to have a significant impact on long-term yields alongside
the reduction of the central bank’s balance sheet. During QT, the Federal Reserve’s reinvestment policy tended to
raise the amount of Treasuries the market had to absorb, thereby actually adding to the effect of the planned increase
in US Treasury issuance. Over the period from April 2019 to December 2023, the expected increase in total issuance
and a relatively stable Federal Reserve balance sheet are expected to lead to a 30 basis point increase in term premia
(Graph I.D, right-hand panel). The future composition of the Federal Reserve’s portfolio is under discussion. The Fed
plans to invest most of the principal payments from agency mortgage-backed securities in Treasury securities with
a maturity structure consistent with that of the outstanding stock. The regression result shows that the choice
of reinvestment maturities is of second-order importance. Full reinvestment in two-year Treasuries would add only
6 basis points to term premia.

in the financial system. See eg R Greenwood, S Hanson and J Stein, “A comparative-advantage approach to government debt maturity”,

erosion of the future room for policy manoeuvre operating mainly through financial
channels.
As regards macroeconomic resilience, one such possibility is through the
negative impact that historically low-for-long interest rates may have on financial
intermediation and credit supply. As discussed above, and to an extent that

BIS Annual Economic Report 2019

25

depends on country characteristics, over the longer term low rates tend to sap
interest margins, profits and hence banks’ ability to build up capital, which is
essential for their lending to the productive economy.
A second possibility works through the impact of very easy and prolonged
financial conditions on economic activity. There is increasing evidence that such
conditions may boost growth in the near term but, depending on circumstances,
could do so at the cost of higher downside risks in the longer term. For instance,
they can become a drag in the future, as they raise debt service burdens and
generate financial vulnerabilities, typically in the form of weaker balance sheets.22
A third possibility is that, over a longer horizon, persistently low rates may
undermine efficient resource allocation and productivity. The effects can be present
in the upswing, when low rates may induce resources to shift into lower productivity
growth sectors during credit booms, and may also work in the downswing, when
very low interest rates for prolonged periods, possibly combined with weak bank
balance sheets, may delay the release of resources from less productive sectors into
more productive ones.23 As noted above, the rise of zombie firms is one such example.
As regards the room for policy manoeuvre, the potential intertemporal tradeoffs may materialise in two ways. First, and most directly, unless normalisation
weakens growth or inflation beyond what is desirable or acceptable, it creates room
to cut interest rates when needed to cushion future adverse developments. Second,
and more subtly, the side effects of very accommodative policies may themselves
reduce the future room for manoeuvre. They may do so by weakening the economy’s
ability to withstand higher rates, making any normalisation harder; and by generating
financial headwinds that potentially limit policy effectiveness.24 In particular, raising
rates becomes harder if debt burdens have increased and financial markets are
more sensitive to monetary policy tightening after prolonged support is withdrawn.
Not only do these considerations underline how difficult a balancing act central
banks face, they also raise a broader question concerning the role of monetary
policy. As the GFC broke out, central banks prevented it from spiralling out of
control and then successfully supported the recovery. At the same time, as discussed
in last year’s Annual Economic Report, following serious financially induced
downturns and given stubbornly subdued inflation, there are diminishing returns
and costs in relying too much on monetary policy. Such an overburdening can
contribute to the re-emergence of financial vulnerabilities and reduce the room for
policy manoeuvre. It becomes natural to ask where the limits to this approach are.
Ostensibly, monetary policy cannot be the engine of higher sustainable economic
growth. More realistically, it may be better regarded as a backstop.

Towards a more balanced policy mix
Looking ahead, these considerations suggest that a more balanced policy mix can
contribute more effectively to sustainable growth and financial stability. It can also
help steer the economy towards the clearer skies that can be discerned after such a
prolonged and at times uncertain recovery. And it would facilitate a shift away from
the debt-fuelled growth model on which the global economy appears to have
relied for so long.
The only way to raise long-term growth on a sustainable basis is to implement
structural reforms. Indeed, productivity growth has been on a long-term downward
trend in advanced economies (Graph I.15).25 Rather disappointing growth at a time
when economies are hovering around estimates of potential and experiencing
unemployment at multi-decade lows underlines this point.
Unfortunately, over the past decade, the momentum in structural reforms has
been lost, as the sense of urgency associated with the GFC has faded. Most ominously,

the emergence of trade tensions has cast a dark cloud over the multilateral trading
system that has underpinned global growth and productivity for decades. The
important area in which structural efforts have proceeded apace is in the financial
sector, where (micro) prudential regulation and supervision have been upgraded,
not least through the implementation of Basel III. But beyond that, is there a role
for macroprudential measures and fiscal policy at more cyclical frequencies?
Macroprudential measures can help alleviate trade-offs.26 Post-crisis, most
countries have made considerable progress in implementing macroprudential
frameworks, with tools ranging from system-wide stress tests and countercyclical
capital requirements to maximum loan-to-value and debt-to-income ratios. The
measures can be usefully activated to limit the build-up of financial vulnerabilities
or cushion the blow when financial cycles turn. Thus, in current circumstances, and
more generally, they provide an extra degree of freedom to monetary policy. They
have the advantage that they can be more targeted, addressing specific risks and
vulnerabilities, such as those arising in the corporate or mortgage sector. Of course,
they are no panacea. Their activation is typically subject to significant political
economy constraints and, given the limited regulatory perimeter – in most countries
mainly confined to banks – they are vulnerable to regulatory arbitrage. Moreover,
they cannot be expected, on their own, to tame financial cycles, especially where
they work at cross purposes with monetary policy.
Fiscal authorities, too, can help in various dimensions. Provided sufficient fiscal
space is available, targeted fiscal expansions may usefully support the economy if
the need arises. The desirability of policy action will also depend on other countryspecific circumstances, including their external balance position. In general, the
most effective fiscal measures are of a structural nature, such as making the tax
system and – where productive opportunities exist – the composition of spending
more growth-friendly, especially by boosting well chosen infrastructure investments.
In the process, it is important to avoid the risk of once more behaving asymmetrically
– easing during downturns, or even pre-emptively, while not consolidating during
expansions. This is one reason why the room for fiscal policy manoeuvre has been
diminishing over time.

is muted when the debt-to-GDP ratio is above trend. For a review of the empirical evidence, see

II. Monetary policy frameworks in EMEs: inflation
targeting, the exchange rate and financial stability

Key takeaways
•

Inflation targeting frameworks in emerging market economies (EMEs) have generally been successful.
These frameworks have been combined with varying degrees of FX intervention, together with the active
use of macroprudential tools.

•

This approach reflects EMEs’ response to capital flow and associated exchange rate volatility as
policymakers seek to design and implement a monetary policy framework for both price and financial
stability.

•

In this way, practice has moved ahead of theory, much as it did when inflation targeting was adopted
in the early 1990s by some advanced economies.

After high inflation and crises in the 1990s, many emerging market economies (EMEs)
adopted inflation targeting as their monetary policy framework, catching up with the
trend set by advanced economies. The transition has been supported by policies to
strengthen economic fundamentals, notably reforms to overcome fiscal dominance,
to bolster banking system soundness and to develop domestic financial markets.
This regime change has coincided with a widespread reduction of inflation to lower
and more stable levels, smoother growth and more stable financial systems.
These achievements have helped EMEs to better integrate themselves into the
global financial system and to reap the benefits of financial globalisation. But
integration has brought new challenges. EMEs have been exposed to large swings
in capital flows and exchange rates, increasingly so since the Great Financial Crisis
(GFC) of 2007–09. Near zero policy rates and large-scale asset purchases in the
major advanced economies have gone hand in hand with strong capital inflows and
exchange rate appreciation in EMEs. In the wake of steps towards monetary policy
normalisation by some major advanced economy central banks, phases of significant
inflows have alternated with phases of strong capital outflows, reflecting risk-on
and risk-off swings in global market sentiment.
To cope with these challenges, most EME inflation targeters have pursued a
controlled floating exchange rate regime, using FX intervention to deal with the
challenges from excessive capital flow and associated exchange rate volatility.
This contrasts with standard textbook prescriptions for inflation targeters, which
advocate free floating without recourse to FX intervention. Moreover, in part due to
the transmission of easy global financial conditions to domestic financial cycles,
policymakers have added macroprudential and, in some cases, capital flow
management measures to their monetary policy toolkit. In this light, the practices
of EME inflation targeters have moved ahead of theory – as was seen in the
advanced open economies when they initially adopted inflation targeting in the
early 1990s.
This chapter reviews the challenges that capital flows and the associated
exchange rate fluctuations have raised for EME monetary policy frameworks. The
first section outlines how EME monetary policy frameworks have evolved over the
past two decades. The second discusses how capital flows and exchange rates affect

EMEs. The third section looks at how EME monetary policy frameworks have adjusted
to cope with these challenges, especially through FX intervention, and at the role of
complementary tools, notably macroprudential measures. The chapter concludes
by exploring some implications for the design of EMEs’ monetary policy frameworks
and of their wider macro-financial stability frameworks.

EME monetary policy frameworks: state of play
Over the past two decades, EME monetary policy frameworks have increasingly
focused on maintaining domestic price stability (Graph II.1, left-hand panel). The
number of major EME central banks operating an explicit inflation targeting regime
has increased considerably, while the number using an explicit exchange rate anchor
has declined.1 Inflation targeting is now the most common framework in major EMEs,
catching up with the prevailing practice in advanced economies (black line). This
evolution accords with the consensus in the mainstream open economy literature,
which has coalesced around the superiority of a monetary policy framework that
focuses on domestic inflation while keeping the exchange rate flexible.2
That said, EME inflation targeters have put significant weight on exchange rate
considerations, as reflected in the more than sevenfold increase in their foreign
exchange reserves over the past two decades, to about $2.6 trillion (Graph II.1, centre
panel).3 In relation to GDP, the reserves of inflation targeting EMEs are more than
three times larger than those of their advanced economy peers.4 In building up these
buffers, mainly after the currency crises of the 1990s, EMEs have sought to self-insure

against the risk of sudden outflows and large devaluations. At the same time, changes
in FX reserves have often tended to correlate positively with the value of the countries’
currencies, suggesting that they have been absorbing exchange rate pressures.5
In addition, EME inflation targeters have resorted to macroprudential measures
in order to address financial stability objectives (Graph II.1, right-hand panel). In
using such tools, which include reserve requirements, loan-to-value caps and
countercyclical capital buffers, they have been considerably more assiduous over
the past two decades than inflation targeting advanced economies. While the
design and governance structure of macroprudential frameworks varies considerably
between countries, many of these tools are at the disposal of the central bank, or
the central bank is part of the decision-making process, eg as a member of a
financial stability council or committee. Macroprudential tools can thus be considered
as part of the wider macro-financial stability framework in which the central bank
plays a key role.
So far, the combination of inflation targeting with FX intervention, complemented
by macroprudential policies, has produced favourable macroeconomic outcomes.
Inflation rates have fallen (Graph II.2, left-hand panel), notwithstanding some
significant differences across countries (Appendix Graph II.1). At the same time,
output growth has been relatively solid and stable (centre panel). Specifically, the
growth rebound after the GFC was stronger than in advanced economies, not least as
EMEs did not experience a financial crisis. However, many EMEs have seen rapid credit
growth (right-hand panel), reflecting at least in part the very accommodative financial
conditions prevailing globally, and potentially raising risks for financial stability.

Challenges from capital flow and exchange rate swings

challenges posed by large swings in capital flows and exchange rates. Over the past

two decades, EMEs have integrated themselves more closely into the global
financial system, dismantling barriers to free movements of capital.6 As a result,
capital inflows increased significantly after the mid-2000s, particularly in the wake
of the GFC, although they have slowed markedly since 2013. These fluctuations
were driven largely by cross-border credit flows, primarily bank loans before the
GFC and increasingly securities thereafter.7 The flows, in turn, reflected global
financial conditions. For instance, they first surged after the GFC when short- and
long-term interest rates in major advanced economies fell to unprecedentedly low
levels and then slowed in the wake of the gradual withdrawal of US monetary
accommodation.8
The evolution of capital flows over the past two decades has gone hand in
hand with major swings in EME exchange rates, visible in large and persistent
movements around their long-run trends (Graph II.3, left-hand panel). Sizeable
inflows during the second half of the first decade of the 2000s and in the wake of
the GFC coincided with persistent appreciations relative to trend, while the
slowdown in inflows since 2013 has proceeded alongside persistent depreciations.
At the same time, EME currencies have experienced larger spikes in exchange rate
volatility around periods of financial stress that emanated from the advanced
economies (Graph II.3, right-hand panel). This has occurred on several occasions
over the past two decades, especially since the GFC, reflecting the vulnerability of
EMEs to alternating risk-on/risk-off sentiment in global financial markets.
Capital flows and associated exchange rate fluctuations affect macroeconomic
and financial stability in EMEs through three main channels: (i) exchange rate passthrough to inflation; (ii) export competitiveness; and (iii) domestic financial conditions.
The impact is more significant in EMEs than in advanced economies owing to their
economic and financial structures.

BIS Annual Economic Report 2019

Exchange rate pass-through to inflation
Exchange rate swings directly impact domestic inflation through their effect on
import prices. This effect is generally larger in EMEs than in advanced economies
due to the larger share of tradable goods, in particular food, in the consumption
baskets, owing to lower income levels.9
The propagation of exchange rate changes to non-tradable prices and inflation
more generally depends on the characteristics of the domestic inflation process.
Here the strength of second-round effects through wages is key. The extent of such
second-round effects depends in particular on how well inflation expectations are
anchored. The anchoring of inflation expectations is, in turn, influenced by the
credibility of the monetary policy framework, which also hinges on its ability to
mitigate destabilising exchange rate swings.10
Exchange rate pass-through to inflation in inflation targeting EMEs has on
average come down over the past two decades (Graph II.4, left-hand panel). While
a sustained 1% depreciation pushed up inflation by 0.6 percentage points in the
early 2000s, the long-run effect was just 0.3 percentage points more recently. Yet
the effect remains, on average, larger than in inflation targeting advanced
economies. The uptick in pass-through over the past few years reflects the impact
of large depreciations in a few countries, notably Russia and Turkey (centre panel).
The aggregate evolution of the pass-through conceals important regional
differences. In particular, it is lower in Asia than elsewhere (Graph II.4, right-hand
panel). Estimates using data over the last six years reveal that a sustained 1% currency

depreciation leads to a long-run increase in the inflation rate by 0.2 percentage
points in Asian inflation targeting EMEs, still more than double the pass-through
estimates for their advanced economy peers. In other inflation targeting EMEs, the
same depreciation raises inflation by 0.35 percentage points.
These differences are in part linked to the strength of second-round effects
(Graph II.4, right-hand panel). Specifically, inflation persistence, ie the influence of
past inflation on current inflation – a rough indicator of the intensity of secondround effects – is relatively low in inflation targeting emerging Asia, even lower
than in advanced economies. By contrast, it is considerably higher in other inflation
targeting EMEs.
To sum up, exchange rate pass-through in inflation targeting EMEs is lower
today than in the past, no doubt in part reflecting better anchored inflation
expectations and the more credible anti-inflation credentials of their frameworks.
Yet, in many EMEs, inflation dynamics are still less well anchored than in advanced
economies.11 In those cases, price stability remains more vulnerable to large currency
depreciations.

Exchange rates and export volumes
Exchange rate swings also affect trade and aggregate demand. Many EMEs are
highly export-dependent, which amplifies the potential relevance of this channel.
From the perspective of the conventional trade channel, a depreciation of the
currency improves the exporters’ international competitiveness. As a result, exports
rise, boosting output, possibly above potential, a level that would create inflationary
pressures on top of those from exchange rate pass-through.
The conventional trade channel rests on the assumption that export prices
adjust in response to a change in the country’s exchange rate. Over short horizons,
however, this may not be the case. This is particularly so in EMEs because their trade
is almost entirely invoiced in foreign currency, primarily in US dollars (Graph II.5,
left-hand panel). If the invoice price is sticky in US dollar terms, swings in a country’s
exchange rate against the US dollar would impact imports, but would in the short
term have little effect on export competitiveness.12 Instead, export volumes would
be affected by changes in import demand from other countries. Thus, a broadbased depreciation of currencies against the US dollar could even reduce EME
export volumes, as demand would contract.
That said, exchange rate swings would still have macroeconomic effects by
influencing export firms’ profits and, through this channel, employment and
investment. If export prices are fixed in US dollar terms, a depreciation of the
currency would increase the value of exports in domestic currency, boosting firms’
profits. This channel is likely to be more pronounced in EMEs, as scope for hedging
exchange rate risk through financial derivatives is much more limited. This is
illustrated by the much smaller FX derivatives markets in EME currencies, as
compared with those of inflation targeting advanced economies (Graph II.5, centre
panel).13 As a consequence, EME exporters tend to be largely unhedged against
currency fluctuations.14
Widespread US dollar trade invoicing underpins the dominance of the US
dollar in global trade financing.15 This, in turn, may influence the effect of exchange
rate swings on EME exports in the same direction as that of sticky prices in dollar
terms. The role of trade finance has increased as global value chains (GVCs) have
lengthened, requiring greater resources to finance them. A stronger US dollar
pushes up the value of trade credit in local currency terms, often in parallel with a
general tightening of financial conditions in EMEs. This financial dimension weakens
the expansionary effect of a currency depreciation on a country’s export volumes.

In the extreme, currency depreciation could even have a contractionary effect on
exports in the short run if GVCs are curtailed due to tighter credit conditions.16
To summarise, the US dollar’s dominance in trade invoicing and trade financing
weakens the impact of exchange rate changes on export volumes, at least in the
short term. Instead, phases of broad US dollar strength would coincide with a
broad-based weakness in global trade. This conclusion is consistent with the strong
negative correlation between the broad US dollar exchange rate and global export
volumes (Graph II.5, right-hand panel).

Capital flows and domestic financial conditions
Capital flows and associated exchange rate fluctuations influence macroeconomic
and financial stability in EMEs through domestic financial conditions. Capital flows
exert a direct quantity effect on credit and asset markets. In addition, asset prices
can move substantially even without significant transactions and, conversely,
quantities may change and affect asset prices and the exchange rate without
involving capital flows.17 Reflecting such tight links and the associated global
arbitrage, asset returns and the yields of bonds denominated in the respective EME
currencies have moved closely together with those in advanced economies, despite
at times divergent macroeconomic conditions.18
Two structural features make EMEs especially vulnerable. First, EME borrowers
rely heavily on foreign currency borrowing, often unhedged. Second, foreign
investors have large holdings of EME assets, particularly bonds, on a similar basis.

BIS Annual Economic Report 2019

37

This means that the exchange rate can amplify the impact of capital flows via the
so-called financial channel of the exchange rate.
The strong expansion of EMEs’ foreign currency debt over the past decade or
so makes the financial channel of the exchange rate especially relevant (Graph II.6,
left-hand panel). Since 2005, the FX debt of major inflation targeting EMEs has
almost tripled, to more than $2 trillion or more than 16% of GDP (up from less than
12% in 2005), mainly driven by corporate sector borrowing in US dollars.19 The
incidence of foreign currency borrowing is smaller in Asian EMEs, where it stood at
around 10% of GDP in 2018, compared with more than 20% in other EMEs.
Borrowers incur currency mismatches whenever the foreign currency debt is
left unhedged by means of FX revenues and assets or derivatives. While widespread
US dollar invoicing in trade means that foreign currency debt servicing costs are
often matched by export revenues, the private sector’s stock of foreign currency
debt is, in many EMEs, much larger than that of foreign assets.20 In addition, and as
mentioned above, scope for hedging often remains limited. This suggests that
currency mismatches are widespread, more so than in advanced economies. As a
result, an appreciation, say, of the domestic currency against the funding currency
would reduce debt servicing costs and debt burdens, lowering EME borrowers’
credit risk, attracting more capital inflows and loosening financial conditions. These
mechanisms work in reverse when the currency depreciates, and are then potentially
amplified through the higher foreign currency debt burdens accumulated in the
appreciation phase.

Just as for borrowers, the strong expansion of foreign investment in local
currency securities heightens the relevance of the financial channel of the exchange
rate. Foreign investors often hold a large share of EME local currency debt securities.
Specifically, in the group of EME inflation targeters, non-residents held, on average,
an estimated 26% of local currency sovereign bonds in 2018, up from 11% in 2005
(Graph II.6, centre panel). Here too, emerging Asian inflation targeters are somewhat
less exposed. To be sure, local currency securities markets are more developed in
EMEs compared with the times when they could only borrow in foreign currency
(“original sin”). Even so, the development has not eliminated the vulnerability
entirely, not least as EME bond markets have a less developed base of domestic
institutional investors (Graph II.6, right-hand panel).21
Investors incur currency mismatches whenever they do not hedge the
corresponding local currency exposures. In this case, a currency appreciation, say,
increases the value of local currency assets in foreign investors’ home currency terms,
relaxing their value-at-risk constraints. This encourages further investment, pushing
down bond yields by compressing the credit risk premium. The same mechanism
plays out in reverse when the exchange rate depreciates.22 This mechanism is one
reason why EME sovereign spreads move inversely with the exchange rate (Graph II.7,
left-hand panel). Indeed, formal empirical analysis for a group of major EMEs finds
that exchange rate appreciation leads to lower local currency bond spreads in EMEs,
and that this reduction turns out to be driven by lower credit risk premia. This is
consistent with the financial channel at work, operating through the risk-taking of
global investors (right-hand panel).
Over longer horizons, the impact of capital flow and associated exchange rate
swings is greater still. This is because external borrowing, be it through banks or

capital markets, interacts with domestic borrowing. There is ample evidence that
external borrowing increases relative to domestic borrowing during credit booms,23
and that strong credit expansion coupled with strong exchange rate appreciation
has preceded financial crises.24 This way, capital flows, exchange rate swings and
domestic financial cycles reinforce each other.

Capital flows, exchange rates and monetary policy in EMEs
The specific ways in which capital flows and associated exchange rate swings affect
EMEs give rise to a number of important challenges and trade-offs for monetary
policy.
First, while exchange rate pass-through has declined, the inflationary
consequences of exchange rate swings have not been vanquished. In many EMEs,
exchange rate pass-through to inflation remains significant, although its decline
over time is no doubt in part a consequence of central banks’ success in containing
inflation in the first place. Large swings in the exchange rate, and especially large
depreciations, still have the potential to de-anchor inflation.
Second, the effects of global financial conditions transmitted through capital
flows tend to weaken the transmission of monetary policy, reducing the central
bank’s ability to steer the economy through adjustments of its policy rate. If
domestic capital market rates and asset prices are tied to swings in global markets,
this weakens the effect of changes in domestic monetary policy.25 The strength of
these effects depends in part on the economy’s financial structure, such as the
relevance of long-term rates relative to short-term rates in credit markets, as bank
short-term rates tend to be more closely related to the domestic policy rate.
The financial channel of the exchange rate adds to this effect. Under the
conventional trade channel, the exchange rate would reinforce monetary transmission.
A monetary policy tightening would lead to exchange rate appreciation, lowering
inflation through exchange rate pass-through and dampening output through its
effect on net exports. But the output effects of the financial channel work in the
opposite direction. An appreciation of the exchange rate would tend to ease
domestic financial conditions, counteracting the tightening effects of higher policy
rates. Thus, the stronger the financial channel is relative to the trade channel, the
weaker is monetary transmission through aggregate demand.
Third, the potential weakening of the classical trade channel through US dollar
trade invoicing and financing, as well as the significance of capital flows and
associated exchange rate swings in shaping domestic financial conditions, may
worsen the short-term trade-off between inflation and output stability. A capital
outflow accompanied by a depreciation of the domestic currency would push up
inflation through exchange rate pass-through, but might have little effect on
domestic output through traditional trade channels, at least in the near term. At
the same time, domestic financial conditions would tighten, exerting a contractionary
effect on the domestic economy. As a result, the central bank may face the
combination of rising inflation and a weak economy. The opposite dilemma would
emerge when capital flows in and the exchange rate appreciates.
Fourth, the effects of capital flows and concomitant exchange rate fluctuations
may give rise to an intertemporal trade-off between stabilising inflation today and
the risk of instability tomorrow. This trade-off is best described in the context of
persistent capital inflows coupled with an appreciating currency. The appreciation
would dampen inflation while loose financial conditions could fuel a domestic
financial boom, boosting both credit expansion and increases in asset prices, not
least those of real estate, and hence economic activity. However, the corresponding

40

build-up of vulnerabilities, notably through debt accumulation, could result in
future economic weakness, a currency depreciation and a probable rise in inflation
once the boom turns to bust. That way, lower inflation and stronger economic
activity in the short run can give way to higher inflation and depressed activity in
the longer run.
Inflation targeting EMEs have met these challenges and trade-offs by
augmenting interest rate policy with FX intervention and, in some cases, balance
sheet policies in domestic assets. Moreover, macroprudential policies, often with
the involvement or even under the lead of the central bank, have complemented
monetary policy frameworks.

FX intervention
Intervention in foreign exchange markets can be used to build buffers against
future sudden outflows and depreciations, as well as to lean against the domestic
consequences of capital flow and exchange rate fluctuations.26 Intervention
strategies, tactics and instruments have varied considerably over time and
across countries (Box II.A). The most common form remains intervention in spot
markets.
Whether such FX intervention, unaccompanied by policy rate changes, can
affect exchange rates at all has long been questioned.27 But recent theoretical
contributions have shown it can be effective under realistic assumptions about
the functioning of financial markets.28 Empirical evidence is consistent with
these results. For instance, Graph II.8 (right-hand panel) reports evidence from
a quarterly panel of EMEs. FX purchases depreciate the currency in a way that
is statistically and economically significant.29 Quantitatively, the effect is very
similar to the appreciating effect of a capital inflow of the same size, suggesting
that FX intervention can counterbalance the effects of capital flows on the
exchange rate.

FX intervention helps tackle the challenges from exchange rate swings in two
main ways. First, through its effect on the exchange rate, it can directly counteract
exchange rate swings that would have undesired effects on the inflation rate and
on the economy. In doing so, it takes some of the burden off interest rate policy,
adding a degree of freedom.
Second, the accumulation of reserves has quasi-macroprudential features. For
one, it provides self-insurance against potential large future devaluations, thereby
serving as an integral part of a country’s financial safety net. Indeed, there are
indications that FX reserve buffers helped mitigate the impact of recent episodes of
global financial stress on EME exchange rates. For instance, in the wake of the taper
tantrum, between 2013 and 2015, EMEs with larger reserve buffers experienced
smaller currency depreciations (Graph II.8, left-hand panel).30 For this purpose, the
reserve accumulation itself does not even need to influence the exchange rate. In
fact, when building up reserves with this objective in mind, central banks often seek
to have as little impact as possible on the external value of the currency.
In addition, FX intervention can counteract the impact of exchange rate swings
on domestic financial conditions. Working through the financial channel of the
exchange rate, FX intervention can break the mutually reinforcing feedback loop
between exchange rate appreciation and capital inflows that fuels domestic credit
creation. In addition, the sterilisation leg of an FX intervention may help mute
domestic credit expansion, to the extent that banks cannot rebalance their asset
portfolios so that the sterilisation instruments on their balance sheets “crowd out”
other lending.31 In line with these notions, evidence across major EMEs suggests
that FX purchases, in addition to slowing exchange rate appreciation, also dampen
domestic credit expansion in a way that quantitatively matches the expansionary
impact coming from capital inflows (Graph II.8, right-hand panel).32 In other words,
FX reserve buffers do not just help to “clean up the mess”, once capital flows reverse
and stress arises, but their accumulation also “leans” against the build-up of
financial imbalances in the first place, reducing the risk, or at least the amplitude, of
a possible reversal.
However, central banks also face difficult trade-offs in the use of FX intervention.
The fiscal cost of carrying reserves can be considerable. This is especially true when
interest rates are very low in reserve currencies, and for countries with high domestic
interest rates. Moreover, to the extent that FX intervention reduces exchange rate
volatility and possibly even the sense of two-way risk, it may induce further carry
trades. And in the longer run, it may encourage currency mismatches, raising the
relevance of the financial channel and making economies more vulnerable.33 How far
precautionary reserves are accumulated and intervention is used as a stabilisation tool
will depend on a cost-benefit analysis, which will vary across countries and over time.
Thus, while FX reserves are an important element of countries’ financial safety
net, they are quite costly and, also for that reason, will always be limited. In times of
large stock adjustments by global investors, outsize capital outflows can overstretch
the central bank’s FX reserve buffer. In order to mitigate this risk, sound policy
frameworks and FX reserve buffers need to be complemented by regional
arrangements for financial assistance, such as FX swap lines, and adequate global
lending facilities at the IMF.
In addition to intervening in the FX market, EME central banks may also
address capital flow and associated exchange rate volatility by using their balance
sheet for operations in domestic rather than foreign currency assets. One such
policy, implemented by several EME central banks, is to offer foreign exchange
protection to investors without affecting the level of international reserves (Box II.A).
This is achieved by auctioning non-deliverable forwards (NDFs) that settle in
domestic currency. The central bank has a natural hedge for this derivative exposure,

FX intervention in EMEs: instruments and tactics

Although spot market interventions remain the most common instrument, the EME FX intervention toolkit has
continued to expand. In particular, derivatives are gaining ground (Table A), as they are becoming the most liquid
segment of the FX market, and play an increasingly important role in determining prices, even for the spot exchange
rate. Two other reasons may be relevant. First is the growing importance of financial stability considerations. With
rising FX debt levels and increased foreign asset holdings, the vulnerability to large FX moves has increased. By
providing market participants with instruments to self-insure, derivatives may be better suited to mitigating these
tail risks. Second, operating in derivatives settled in local currency reduces the risk of having to report unwelcome
changes in FX reserves, which might trigger undesirable market dynamics.

Finance, vol 47, October 2014, pp 202–16; national authorities.

With regard to timing, central banks generally intervene reactively, once the initial bout of market pressure has
subsided. This lets them maximise the effectiveness of intervention, instead of falling victim to market forces and
depleting reserves significantly without having much impact. Such an approach can also be more flexible. For
example, if the pressure on the currency reflects proxy hedging, it is more likely to be self-correcting and may not
warrant intervention.
A comprehensive understanding of the functioning of global FX markets is especially valuable. It helps underpin
central banks’ decision-making on the best timing and place to intervene. For example, if the objective is to influence
the exchange rate, operating in locations where and time zones when market liquidity is thin would enhance the
impact. On the other hand, if the objective is to adjust the stock of reserves with minimal impact on the exchange
rate, intervening in highly liquid markets and during hours when there is a large turnover would be desirable.
Discretionary interventions are the norm in EMEs, and very few central banks have experimented successfully
with formal rules-based interventions. Discretion allows central banks to intervene flexibly, limit detection risk, and

BIS Annual Economic Report 2019

43

maximise effectiveness on account of the surprise factor. It also makes it harder for market participants to trade
against the central bank, as in the case of precommitted intervention rules.
On communication and transparency, there is a marked difference across regions. Central banks in Latin
America have typically opted for more transparency, both in terms of preannouncing their interventions and
providing more detailed information after the fact. Central banks in Asian EMEs have been less transparent.
Central banks have increasingly relied on market-based instruments to sterilise their interventions. As a result,
central bank securities have become the most common instrument and reserve requirements have lost ground
markedly. While market-based instruments can be more costly, they are instrumental in developing deep and liquid
domestic bond markets and a local currency yield curve. Derivatives are quite prominent, and FX swaps in particular
have long been used for sterilisation.

 See eg T Ehlers and F Packer, “FX and derivatives markets in emerging market economies and the internationalisation of their currencies”,
BIS Quarterly Review, December 2013, pp 55–67. In particular, they document that the ratio of derivatives to spot market turnover in EMEs
increased from 1.6 in 2007 to 2.3 in 2013.     As per the IMF’s special data dissemination standards (SDDS), only derivatives that are
settled in foreign currency are recorded as reserves, while derivatives settled in local currency are reported only as “memo items”. Market
participants often tend to focus on headline reserve numbers excluding derivative positions.     See P Cavallino and N Patel, “FX intervention:
goals, strategies and tactics”, BIS Papers, forthcoming, 2019.

ie its international reserves. Thus, offering such protection is equivalent to adjusting
the currency composition of the central bank’s balance sheet. As a result, such
operations can be effective only when backed by a sufficiently large stock of foreign
reserves.
Central banks could also address capital outflows, and thus exchange rate
pressures, by facilitating the adjustment of investor portfolios in times of stress.
Advanced economy central banks have provided monetary stimulus by taking
duration out of the market through asset purchases, lowering long-term interest
rates. EME central banks could follow a similar approach in times of stress.
Specifically, when a large amount of foreign capital has been channelled into longduration public debt and threatens to flow out quickly, the central bank may buy
long-term government bonds and sell short-term instruments in order to stabilise
bond markets.34

Macroprudential tools
Macroprudential policies complement monetary policy frameworks as an integral
element of the wider macro-financial stability framework. They are targeted
specifically at addressing risks to financial stability, which arise from domestic
financial imbalances.
As discussed in detail in last year’s Annual Economic Report,35 such policies rely
on a wide set of instruments. These range from tools such as system-wide stress
tests, countercyclical capital buffers and dynamic provisions to maximum loan-tovalue and debt-to-income ratios. Compared with FX intervention, they target
financial vulnerabilities more directly. And, in doing so, they provide an additional
degree of freedom for monetary policy too.
Overall, the experience of the past two decades indicates that macroprudential
measures do help improve the trade-offs monetary policy faces, including those
in connection with capital flow and associated exchange rate fluctuations. They do
so by strengthening the resilience of the financial system and by leaning against the
build-up of financial imbalances. There is increasing evidence that macroprudential
tools can to some extent influence variables such as credit, asset prices and the
amplitude of the financial cycle.36 At the same time, because they are largely bankbased, they can leak. And they may be subject to a certain inaction bias,37 because

44

BIS Annual Economic Report 2019

of political economy pressures, among other factors. The evidence suggests that
macroprudential measures alone cannot contain the build-up of financial
imbalances and that they are best regarded as complements rather than substitutes
for monetary policy in the pursuit of macro-financial stability.38
In addition, in some cases, authorities have also relied on capital flow
management tools, as these have become less controversial over time.39 That said,
evidence for their effectiveness is mixed. For example, while recent empirical studies
have generally found that these tools can slow down targeted flows, these effects
are typically temporary.40 Moreover, evidence in the post-GFC period suggests that
tighter capital inflow restrictions generate spillovers to other countries.41

Sketching a framework
EME inflation targeting frameworks differ in significant respects from textbook
inflation targeting frameworks, which prescribe pursuing price stability exclusively
through adjustments in policy interest rates combined with freely floating exchange
rates. EME central banks have addressed the challenges from capital flow and
associated exchange rate swings through the use of complementary policy
instruments. This practice has served EMEs well, as indicated by their macroeconomic
performance over the past decades and the more specific empirical evidence
supporting such a strategy. Yet important challenges remain.
As EME inflation targeters have moved ahead of theory, so the conceptual
foundations of their frameworks have lagged behind. In particular, the different
elements have been analysed largely in isolation. Box II.B provides a schematic
framework that brings the different elements together and suggests how they can
rationalise current policies. The analysis shows how the various channels through
which capital flows and the exchange rate impact EMEs worsen trade-offs for central
bank stabilisation policy and how FX intervention and macroprudential tools can
ameliorate these trade-offs. Yet a full-fledged analytical framework that captures
EME inflation targeters’ full suite of policy practices remains to be developed.
On the practical side, the challenge is how best to design, implement and
combine the various tools. Central banks need to decide how to develop and use
their toolboxes. These include not only monetary tools proper, such as FX
intervention, but also macroprudential tools, if these are under central bank control.
The choice of instruments and their exact deployment will depend on countryspecific factors, particularly economic and financial structures, as well as on the
macro-financial background and policy objectives.
At the same time, authorities have to determine the policy horizon. Under
inflation targeting regimes, monetary policy usually aims at stabilising inflation
over horizons of up to two years, with policy decisions typically taken at less than a
quarterly frequency. Macroprudential measures have a longer horizon, as they aim
to mitigate longer-run financial stability risks. Given the slow-moving nature of such
risks, these tools are adjusted less frequently, sometimes at yearly frequencies. By
contrast, FX intervention often has a very short horizon, especially if it is aimed at
stabilising exchange rate volatility, and operations may even be carried out at daily
frequencies. However, both FX intervention and macroprudential measures shape
the trade-offs involved in interest rate decisions (Box II.B).
This raises the question of the appropriate horizon for monetary policy. There
is the enduring question of whether central banks may need to lengthen the
horizon of their inflation targets in order to better address the intertemporal tradeoff between short-term economic performance and longer-term financial and
macroeconomic stability. One way of doing so is to enhance flexibility by lengthening

BIS Annual Economic Report 2019

45

the horizon over which inflation targets are pursued. This would help address the
longer-run risks financial imbalances pose to macroeconomic stability. Importantly,
the need for flexibility to address this intertemporal trade-off arises only when
inflation is below target. This is because the reversal of capital inflows would result
in inflationary pressures through its impact on the exchange rate. By implication, a
tighter policy during the capital flow surge when inflation is already above target
would be called for in response to both short-term and medium-term considerations.
Managing macroeconomic and financial stability with multiple instruments
also poses challenges in terms of instrument assignment and coordination,
especially as the transmission channels of the different instruments overlap. A
common approach for instrument assignment is separation: policy rates respond
primarily to domestic price and output developments, FX intervention mainly to
unwelcome exchange rate fluctuations, and macroprudential measures to financial
stability risks. Instruments are set in sequence, each taking the previous ones as
given, and with different policy horizons. A rationale for instrument separation is
clarity in the allocation of responsibilities, which could bolster the framework’s
credibility. The drawback is that each instrument is calibrated in isolation, rather
than in a coordinated way, which could in theory yield better results.42
There are major communication challenges as well. Clear communication
about policy objectives, frameworks, rules and decisions is generally seen as a
key factor boosting the credibility and accountability of monetary policy regimes.
This basic insight also applies to frameworks operated with multiple tools (interest
rates and FX interventions, complemented by macroprudential tools) and
multiple objectives (price, macroeconomic and financial stability). Yet outlining
a communication strategy with multiple tools and objectives is particularly
challenging. In such cases, authorities could benefit from frequent cross-referencing
of decisions and rationalising the context, scope and objective behind each so as to
minimise the risk of sending mixed signals. This is especially important in cases
where different tools are used to achieve objectives at different horizons, so that
they may not always move in the same direction.
In addition to boosting credibility and accountability, clear and active
communication about policy rationales and intentions also matters for the
effectiveness of specific measures and strategies. The transmission of policy rates to
longer-term rates can be enhanced through transparency about the reaction
function and the envisaged path of policy rates. For FX intervention, communication
strategies will depend on the intermediate objective. If FX intervention serves to
accumulate precautionary FX reserve buffers without any intended effect on
exchange rates, the central bank might intervene discreetly or alternatively
preannounce an intended fixed path for purchases. Rules-based FX intervention
might help stabilise the exchange rate as market participants internalise the central
bank’s reaction to excess volatility, but it may also encourage position-taking
against the central bank and reduce the surprise element of the intervention.
In future, EME central banks will need to further develop their toolboxes,
frameworks and communications. At a time of large and internationally mobile
financial capital and low interest rates, risk-taking and the search for yield acquire
greater prominence and can expose EMEs to disruptive stock adjustments by global
investors. Thus, central banks may need to reinforce and refine their FX intervention
strategies and tactics. They may also need to consider further developing balance
sheet policies in the domestic currency to help stabilise conditions in their capital
markets at times of stress. In addition, in countries where inflation is low and well
anchored, there could be scope for increasing the flexibility of inflation targeting
frameworks to better take into account the longer-run risks to macroeconomic
stability linked to the build-up of financial imbalances.

Monetary policy in EMEs: a simple analytical model

Capital flow fluctuations affect EMEs’ macroeconomic stability through their impact on inflation, exports and domestic
financial conditions via various channels. This box highlights the trade-offs that these effects may give rise to for
EMEs, drawing on a stylised model. The trade-offs are both immediate, when inflation stabilisation comes at the
cost of output stabilisation, and intertemporal, when stabilising inflation today raises macroeconomic vulnerabilities
tomorrow. FX intervention and macroprudential tools can improve these trade-offs.
We develop a stylised simple model for the main channels through which capital flows affect EMEs, as discussed
in the main text. The model is simply a pedagogical device designed to provide a stylised framework for policy
analysis – as a reference point for future research. In the model, a surge in capital inflows appreciates the exchange
rate, which, in turn, reduces import prices (pass-through channel) and export competitiveness (trade channel). The
impact of the exchange rate on exports depends on trade invoicing and trade financing. Foreign currency invoicing
and greater integration in global value chains (GVCs) weaken the trade channel, so that a currency appreciation
might not act as a drag on economic activity, at least in the short run. Furthermore, the exchange rate affects
domestic expenditure through its impact on domestic financial conditions (financial channel). An exchange rate
appreciation improves domestic credit conditions and thus boosts domestic demand. Monetary policy affects the
economy through the standard effects of the interest rate on domestic demand and on the exchange rate.
The strength of these channels determines the ultimate impact of capital flows on economic activity and
inflation, and therefore shapes the trade-offs faced by central banks. Consider, first, the case of a baseline open
economy lacking a financial channel and featuring a moderate inflation pass-through and a strong trade channel. In
this situation, the appreciation caused by a capital inflow surge reduces inflation and output. By cutting its policy

rate, the central bank can counteract this contractionary effect, but it cannot fully stabilise output and inflation at
the same time. This is because the exchange rate affects inflation not only through the output gap but also directly
through import prices via the exchange rate. Hence, the central bank faces a trade-off between output and
inflation stabilisation, as represented by the downward-sloping line in Graph II.B.1 (left-hand panel). Greater inflation
stabilisation is achieved only at the cost of more output variability, and vice versa. By changing its policy rate, the
central bank can move along the frontier and achieve different combinations of inflation and output stabilisation.
The central bank will choose the combination it prefers. The dotted curves in the graph provide a conventional
representation of the central bank preferences. Points on the same curve represent combinations that the central
bank values equally (ie give rise to the same welfare loss), while higher curves are associated with worse outcomes.
The origin of the graph represents the first best, ie the point where output is at potential and inflation is equal to its
target. The central bank sets the interest rate to implement the feasible combination of output and inflation gaps
that lies on the curve closest to the first best.
Trade-offs worsen in the case, more realistic for an EME, where the exchange rate also affects domestic financial
conditions, its pass-through to inflation is high due to foreign currency trade invoicing, or the trade channel is
weaker due to the combination of foreign currency trade invoicing and trade financing. A strong financial channel
and a weak trade channel reduce the contractionary effect of capital inflows on output, while a high degree of passthrough raises the negative impact of exchange rate appreciation on inflation. As a result, output and inflation move
in a less synchronised way. Thus, the combinations of output and inflation gaps the central bank can achieve
through interest rate policy shift outwards, further away from the origin (Graph II.B.1, centre panel). The central
bank can attain the same level of inflation only by boosting output further beyond its potential. If the financial
channel is particularly strong, dominating the trade channel, then output actually rises in response to an exchange
rate appreciation. In this case, the trade-off between output and inflation is even worse, as the two variables move
in opposite directions.
FX intervention is assumed to affect the exchange rate independently of conventional interest rate policy and
can thus help to improve policy trade-offs. Specifically, to the extent that FX intervention can limit exchange rate
movements by absorbing part of the capital flows, it makes it easier to stabilise the economy in response to shifts in
global financial conditions (Graph II.B.1, right-hand panel). The feasible combinations of output and inflation gaps
attainable with changes in interest rates shift back inwards towards the origin, improving outcomes.

In addition to these immediate trade-offs, there are also intertemporal ones. Capital inflows lead to an increase
in foreign debt, weakening the country’s foreign asset position and possibly translating into a wider build-up of
financial imbalances. This increases the economy’s sensitivity to capital flow swings over time, as debt accumulates.
Hence an intertemporal trade-off arises between inflation stability today and inflation volatility tomorrow. Specifically,
the larger the cumulated capital inflows, the stronger the risks and impact of their potential future reversal. For
example, in the face of a capital inflow surge and associated exchange rate appreciation, the central bank may cut
its policy rate to mitigate the downward pressure on inflation. But to the extent that policy easing boosts imports
and worsens the current account, the resulting increase in foreign debt raises the economy’s exposure to capital
flow reversals down the road, increasing future macroeconomic volatility. Taking this into consideration would
mean tempering policy easing, and tolerating larger inflation deviations from target today in order to have more
stability in the future (moving from the dot to the square in Graph II.B.2, left-hand panel).
Macroprudential measures can ameliorate this intertemporal trade-off by mitigating the build-up of financial
vulnerabilities and hence reducing the economy’s sensitivity to capital flow and associated exchange rate swings. This
would shift the trade-off frontier towards the origin (Graph II.B.2, right-hand panel). Foreign exchange intervention
can have a similar effect. However, while macroprudential measures improve the economy’s resilience, foreign
exchange intervention directly limits foreign debt accumulation by leaning against exchange rate appreciation,
further improving the trade-off.
 See footnote in Graph II.B.1 for a short summary of the model’s key elements and the online appendix for a more detailed exposition.    
 As discussed in the main text, capital flows can also impact domestic financial conditions directly, not only through the exchange rate.
The analysis developed in this box would not change in the presence of such a direct link.     Monetary policy might also affect capital
flows through its impact on the carry trade. This channel can weaken and even reverse the transmission of monetary policy to the domestic
economy. See P Cavallino and D Sandri, “The expansionary lower bound: contractionary monetary easing and the trilemma”, BIS Working

the prices of imported goods via the exchange rate.     As discussed in the main text, there are many reasons not included in the model
that make it suboptimal to completely stabilise the exchange rate through intervention. For the case of the quasi-fiscal cost of intervention,
see P Cavallino, “Capital flows and foreign exchange intervention”, American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics, vol 11, no 2, April 2019,
pp 127–70.     To simplify the analysis, we assume that the country’s exposure is proportional to its net foreign asset position. Hence, a
reduction in the domestic policy rate increases financial vulnerabilities if it worsens the current account. However, this condition might be
too restrictive, given that a country’s exposure is a function of its gross, rather than just net, asset position. See eg C Borio and P Disyatat,
“Global imbalances and the financial crisis: link or no link?”, BIS Working Papers, no 346, May 2011.     In our model, foreign debt amplifies
the impact of capital flow and associated exchange rate swings and raises macroeconomic volatility. In reality, the build-up of financial
vulnerabilities affects not only the exposure to but also the likelihood of a capital flow reversal. This channel worsens the intertemporal
trade-off. More generally, if one also took into account the impact of monetary easing on domestic credit growth, the intertemporal tradeoff would be even worse. See T Adrian and N Liang, “Monetary policy, financial conditions, and financial stability”, International Journal of
Central Banking, vol 14, no 1, January 2018, pp 73–132.  As for foreign exchange intervention, we abstract from any cost of
macroprudential measures. For example, countercyclical regulatory rules might induce volatility in capital requirements that can translate
into volatility in other macroeconomic variables, including the exchange rate. See P-R Agénor, K Alper and L Pereira da Silva, “Sudden
floods, macroprudential regulation and stability in an open economy”, Journal of International Money and Finance, vol 48, November 2014,
pp 68–100.

From a broader perspective, sound monetary policy frameworks need to be
complemented by sound structural, fiscal and regulatory policies at the national
level. One especially relevant element is the development of a stronger domestic
base of institutional investors, reducing the dependence on foreign funding. At the
same time, sound policy frameworks at the national level need to be complemented
by a credible and effective global financial safety net that would mitigate risks of
speculative attacks and reduce the need for self-insurance through large-scale FX
reserve accumulation.

According to de facto classifications of exchange rate regimes proposed by academic researchers
and which are based on the actual behaviour of exchange rates rather than official labels, EME
inflation targeters are commonly characterised as managed floaters or as having crawling bands or
pegs, while in advanced economies free floating is quite common. See E Ilzetzki, C Reinhart and
K Rogoff, “Exchange arrangements entering the 21st century: which anchor will hold?”, Quarterly
Journal of Economics, vol 134, no 2, May 2019.

Throughout this chapter, the term “FX intervention” is used to refer exclusively to sterilised FX
intervention. “Non-sterilised” interventions alter the level of bank reserves and, all else equal, go
hand in hand with a change in the policy rate. The exception is when central banks operate with
a floor (excess reserves) system, so that the policy rate is set equal to the deposit facility. But, in
that case, bank reserves are effectively perfect substitutes for short-term government paper,
making the distinction dubious at best. For a more detailed discussion, see P Disyatat, “Monetary
policy implementation: misconceptions and their consequences”, BIS Working Papers, no 269,
December 2008.

28

The literature identifies two channels through which interventions can affect the exchange rate.
The first is the signalling channel, which changes market participants’ expectations about
macroeconomic conditions or future policy. The second is a portfolio balance channel, which
operates whenever assets denominated in different currencies are imperfect substitutes. For a
survey of the early literature, see L Sarno and M Taylor, “Official intervention in the foreign
exchange market: is it effective and, if so, how does it work?”, Journal of Economic Literature, vol 39,
no 3, September 2001, pp 839–68. For recent theoretical contributions on the portfolio balance
channel, see X Gabaix and M Maggiori, “International liquidity and exchange rate dynamics”,

III. Big tech in finance: opportunities and risks

Key takeaways
•

The entry of large technology firms (“big techs”) into financial services holds the promise of efficiency
gains and can enhance financial inclusion.

•

Regulators need to ensure a level playing field between big techs and banks, taking into account big
techs’ wide customer base, access to information and broad-ranging business models.

•

Big techs’ entry presents new and complex trade-offs between financial stability, competition and data
protection.

Technology firms such as Alibaba, Amazon, Facebook, Google and Tencent have
grown rapidly over the last two decades. The business model of these “big techs”
rests on enabling direct interactions among a large number of users. An essential
by-product of their business is the large stock of user data which are utilised as
input to offer a range of services that exploit natural network effects, generating
further user activity. Increased user activity then completes the circle, as it generates
yet more data.
Building on the advantages of the reinforcing nature of the data-networkactivities loop, some big techs have ventured into financial services, including
payments, money management, insurance and lending. As yet, financial services
are only a small part of their business globally. But given their size and customer
reach, big techs’ entry into finance has the potential to spark rapid change in the
industry. It offers many potential benefits. Big techs’ low-cost structure business can
easily be scaled up to provide basic financial services, especially in places where a
large part of the population remains unbanked. Using big data and analysis of the
network structure in their established platforms, big techs can assess the riskiness
of borrowers, reducing the need for collateral to assure repayment. As such, big
techs stand to enhance the efficiency of financial services provision, promote
financial inclusion and allow associated gains in economic activity.
At the same time, big techs’ entry into finance introduces new elements in the
risk-benefit balance. Some are old issues of financial stability and consumer
protection in new settings. In some settings, such as the payment system, big techs
have the potential to loom large very quickly as systemically relevant financial
institutions. Given the importance of the financial system as an essential public
infrastructure, the activities of big techs are a matter of broader public interest that
goes beyond the immediate circle of their users and stakeholders.
There are also important new and unfamiliar challenges that extend beyond the
realm of financial regulation as traditionally conceived. Big techs have the potential
to become dominant through the advantages afforded by the data-networkactivities loop, raising competition and data privacy issues. Public policy needs to
build on a more comprehensive approach that draws on financial regulation,
competition policy and data privacy regulation. The aim should be to respond to
big techs’ entry into financial services so as to benefit from the gains while limiting
the risks. As the operations of big techs straddle regulatory perimeters and

BIS Annual Economic Report 2019

55

geographical borders, coordination among authorities – national and international
– is crucial.
This chapter begins with a description of big techs’ inroads into finance. The
second section analyses the reasons for this entry and how big techs’ business
models can create competitive advantages over banks. The third section analyses
the potential effects of big techs on financial intermediation and the final one
discusses possible implications for public policy.

Big techs in finance
The activities of big techs in finance are a special case of broader fintech innovation.
Fintech refers to technology-enabled innovation in financial services, including the
resulting new business models, applications, processes and products.1 While fintech
companies are set up to operate primarily in financial services, big tech firms offer
financial services as part of a much wider set of activities.
Big techs’ core businesses are in information technology and consulting
(eg cloud computing and data analysis), which account for around 46% of their
revenues (Graph III.1, left-hand panel). Financial services represent about 11%.
While big techs serve users globally, their operations are mainly located in Asia and
the Pacific and North America (right-hand panel). Their move into financial services
has been most extensive in China, but they have also been expanding rapidly in
other emerging market economies (EMEs), notably in Southeast Asia, East Africa
and Latin America.
In offering financial services, big techs both compete and cooperate with banks
(Table III.1).2 Thus far, they have focused on providing basic financial services to
their large network of customers and have acted as a distribution channel for thirdparty providers, eg by offering wealth management or insurance products.

Payment services
Payments were the first financial service big techs offered, mainly to help overcome
the lack of trust between buyers and sellers on e-commerce platforms. Buyers want
delivery of goods, but sellers are only willing to deliver after being assured of
payment. Payment services like those provided by Alipay (owned by Alibaba) or
PayPal (owned by eBay) allow guaranteed settlement at delivery and/or reclaims by
buyers and are fully integrated into e-commerce platforms. In some regions with
less developed retail payment systems, new payment services emerged through
mobile network operators (eg M-Pesa in several African countries). Over time, big
techs’ payment services have become more widely used as an alternative to other
electronic payment means such as credit and debit cards.
Big techs’ payment platforms currently are of two distinct types. In the first
type, the “overlay” system, users rely on existing third-party infrastructures, such as
credit card or retail payment systems, to process and settle payments (eg Apple

57

Pay, Google Pay, PayPal). In the second, users can make payments which are
processed and settled on a system proprietary to the big tech (eg Alipay, M-Pesa,
WePay).
While big techs’ payment platforms compete with those provided by banks,
they still largely depend on banks. In the first type, directly so; in the second, users

difficult for senders to verify receipt of funds. Some big techs have started to offer
(near) real-time transfers at relatively low cost. Examples include the remittance
service between Hong Kong SAR and the Philippines offered by Alipay HK (a joint
venture of Ant Financial and CK Hutchison) and GCash (operated by Globe
Telecom). These cross-border transactions, however, still rely on a correspondent
banking network and require collaboration with banks. Other big techs (eg Facebook)
are reportedly considering offering payment services for their customers on a
global basis.3

Money market funds and insurance products
Big techs use their wide customer network and brand name recognition to offer
money market funds and insurance products on their platforms. This business line
capitalises on big techs’ payment services. Big techs’ one-stop shops aim to be
more accessible, faster and more user-friendly than those offered by banks and
other financial institutions.
On big tech payment platforms, customers often maintain a balance in their
accounts.4 To put these funds to use, big techs offer money market funds (MMFs) as
short-term investments. The MMF products offered are either managed by
companies affiliated with the big tech firm or by third parties. By analysing their
customers’ investment and withdrawal patterns, big techs can closely manage the
MMFs’ liquidity. This allows them to offer users the possibility to invest (and
withdraw) their funds almost instantaneously.
In China, MMFs offered through big tech platforms have grown substantially
since their inception (Graph III.3, left-hand panel). Within five years, the Yu’ebao
money market fund offered to Alipay users grew into the world’s largest MMF, with
assets over CNY 1 trillion (USD 150 billion) and around 350 million customers.
Despite their rapid growth, MMFs affiliated with big techs in China are still
relatively small compared with other savings vehicles. At end-2018, total MMF

The expansion of big tech MMFs in China and in other countries has benefited
from favourable market conditions. For example, the launch of Yu’ebao coincided
with interbank interest rates exceeding deposit rates, allowing big techs to offer
higher rates. As rates declined recently, Yu’ebao’s assets stopped growing and even
saw reductions (Graph III.3, centre panel). Similarly, PayPal closed its MMF in 2011,

credit per capita, the total flow of fintech credit amounted to less than 3% of total
credit outstanding to the non-bank sector in 2017.
Big techs’ relatively small lending footprint so far has reflected their limited
ability to fund themselves through retail deposits. Big techs have some options to
overcome this constraint.
One is to establish an online bank. But in some countries, regulatory authorities
restrict the opening of remote (online) bank accounts. One example is China, where
the two Chinese big tech banks (MYbank and WeBank) rely mostly on the interbank
market funding and certificates of deposit (Graph III.5, left-hand panel) rather than
on traditional deposits. More recently, however, these banks have started to issue
“smart deposits” that offer significantly higher interest rates than other time
deposits and the possibility of early withdrawal at a reduced rate.
A second option is to partner with a bank. Big techs can provide the customer
interface and allow for quick loan approval using advanced data analytics; if
approved, the bank is left to raise funds and manage the loan. This option can be
attractive to big techs as their platforms are easily scalable at low cost and they
interface directly with the client. It may also be profitable for banks, as they can
gain an extra return – despite providing lower value added services.
A third option is to obtain funds through loan syndication or securitisation –
already a common strategy among fintech firms. For instance, Ant Financial’s gross
issuance of exchange-traded asset-backed securities (ABS) accounted for almost
one third of the total securitisation in China in 2017 (Graph III.5, right-hand panel).

Why do big techs expand into financial services?
Big techs have typically entered financial services once they have secured an
established customer base and brand recognition. Their entry into finance reflects
strong complementarities between financial services and their core non-financial
activities, and the associated economies of scope and scale.

Big techs’ life cycle: theory and practice

61

Graph III.A

The DNA of big techs
Data analytics, network externalities and interwoven activities (“DNA”) constitute
the key features of big techs’ business models. These three elements reinforce each
other. The “network externalities” of a big tech’s platform relate to the fact that
a user’s benefit from participating on one side of a platform (eg as a seller on
an e-commerce platform) increases with the number of users on the other side
(eg buyers). Network externalities beget more users and more value for users. They
allow the big tech to generate more data, the key input into data analytics. The
analysis of large troves of data enhances existing services and attracts further users.
More users, in turn, provide the critical mass of customers to offer a wider range of
activities, which yield even more data. Accordingly, network externalities are
stronger on platforms that offer a broader range of services, and represent an
essential element in big techs’ life cycle (Box III.A).
Financial services both benefit from and fuel the DNA feedback loop. Offering
financial services can complement and reinforce big techs’ commercial activities.
The typical example is payment services, which facilitate secure transactions on
e-commerce platforms, or make it possible to send money to other users on social
media platforms. Payment transactions also generate data detailing the network of
links between fund senders and recipients. These data can be used both to enhance
existing (eg targeted advertising) and other financial services, such as credit scoring.
The source and type of data and the related DNA synergies vary across big
tech platforms. Those with a dominant presence in e-commerce collect data from
vendors, such as sales and profits, combining financial and consumer habit
information. Big techs with a focus on social media have data on individuals and
their preferences, as well as their network of connections. Big techs with search
engines do not observe connections directly, but typically have a broad base of
users and can infer their preferences from their online searches.
The type of synergies varies with the nature of the data collected. Data from
e-commerce platforms can be a valuable input into credit scoring models, especially
for SME and consumer loans. Big techs with a large user base in social media or
internet search can use the information on users’ preferences to market, distribute
and price third-party financial services (eg insurance).
Although large banks have many customers and offer a wide range of services
too (eg distribution of wealth management or insurance products, mortgages), so
far they have not been as effective as big techs at harnessing the DNA feedback
loop. Payments aside, banks have not exploited activities with strong network
externalities. One reason is the required separation of banking and commerce in
most jurisdictions.6 As a result, banks have access mostly to account transaction
data only. Moreover, legacy IT systems are not easily linked to various other services
through, for instance, application programming interfaces (APIs).7 Combining their
advanced technology with richer data and a stronger customer focus, big techs
have been adept at developing and marketing new products and services. The main
competitive advantages and disadvantages of large banks versus big techs are
summarised in Table III.2.

Big techs’ impact on financial services
Big techs’ DNA can lower the barriers to provision of financial services by reducing
information and transaction costs, and thereby enhance financial inclusion.
However, these gains vary by financial service and could come with new risks and
market failures.

62

BIS Annual Economic Report 2019

Box III.A

Big techs’ life cycle

Big techs primarily create value as online multi-sided platforms (MSPs), by enabling and catalysing direct interactions
between two or more groups of users (eg buyers and sellers). The three main types of online platforms are social
networks, e-commerce platforms and search engines.
In contrast to traditional bilateral exchanges, users on each side transact with each other through the platform
– not with the platform. Social platforms, for example, allow people to connect to each other, and each member
benefits from a larger community. Online shopping websites enable their users to buy and sell a wide variety of
goods and services worldwide. A larger number of sellers reduces buyers’ search costs, and a larger number of
buyers expands sellers’ business opportunities. A typical feature of MSPs is the presence of network externalities: the
very fact that users participate on one side of the platform (eg buyers) increases users’ benefits on the other side
(eg sellers). One challenge is to attract users on both sides at the same time – a chicken-and-egg problem. Successful
platforms solve this problem by using specific price structures, which essentially consist in charging a lower fee to
the side that creates the most network externalities – and letting the side that benefits the most from the network
subsidise the other.
Big techs have so far followed a rather traditional corporate life cycle with three phases: birth, growth and
maturity (Graph III.A, left-hand panel). What makes them unique is the coincidence of several factors (ie the
collection of personal data on a large scale, network effects and a large number of activities) and the high speed at
which they reach maturity. Indeed, big techs, albeit young, have attracted – often in less than a decade – many more
customers than even the largest banks.
Once an MSP has attracted a sufficient mass of users on both sides, the emphasis is on increasing the number of
users further, and reaching the tipping point at which adoption rates accelerate and network effects kick in. Beyond
this point, growth can be very fast (Graph III.A, right-hand panel). More buyers bring more sellers – and vice versa –
and the MSP enjoys increasing returns to scale. The average cost of serving a user declines with the total number of
users. And users are willing to pay more for access to a bigger network. As a result, the platform’s margins improve.

Big techs’ potential benefits in lending activities
Besides the cost of raising funds, the cost of lending is closely tied to the ex ante
evaluation of credit risk and the ex post enforcement of loan repayments. To price
loans, banks must assess the riskiness of their borrowers, typically by gathering
information from various sources and building close relationships. To incentivise
borrowers to repay their loans and limit losses in case of default, banks monitor
borrowers or require collateral. As all this is costly and time-consuming, banks
require a compensation in the form of fees or interest rate spreads.8 Big techs’
access to and use of big data for screening and monitoring borrowers’ activity
reduce such costs, which can improve efficiency and broaden access to financing.

Screening and financial inclusion
The information cost may sometimes be so prohibitive that banks refrain from
serving borrowers – or do so only at very high spreads. This is true regardless of
whether the information is soft (communicated but difficult to quantify) or hard
(quantitative data that can be easily processed). Most at risk from exclusion are
borrowers who lack basic documentation or are difficult to reach, eg because they
are too remote geographically. For instance, many SMEs in developing economies

64

do not meet the minimum requirements for a formal bank loan application, as they
often do not have audited financial statements.
As a result, big techs can have a competitive advantage over banks and serve
firms and households that otherwise would remain unbanked (Graph III.6, left-hand
panel). They do so by tapping different but relevant information through their
digital platforms.9 For example, Ant Financial and Mercado Libre claim that their
credit quality assessment and granting of loans typically involve more than 1,000
data series per loan applicant.
Recent BIS empirical research also suggests that big techs’ credit scoring
applied to small vendors outperforms models based on credit bureau ratings and
traditional borrower characteristics (Box III.B). All this could represent a significant
advance in financial inclusion and help improve firms’ performance.10 Although the
preliminary evidence is encouraging, it is still early to draw definitive conclusions
on the quality of those risk assessments. Most have been applied to very specific
forms of credit (eg small business credit lines), the comparisons do not include the
soft information available to banks and performance has not been tested through
full business and financial cycles. 11

Monitoring and collateral
The cost of enforcing loan repayments is an important component of total financial
intermediation cost. To reduce enforcement problems banks usually require
borrowers to pledge tangible assets, such as real estate, as collateral to increase
recovery rates in the case of default. Another mean is monitoring. Banks spend
time and resources monitoring their clients’ projects to limit the risk that borrowers
implement them differently from what was agreed initially. Through monitoring,
firms and financial intermediaries also develop long-term relationships and build
mutual trust, which makes defaulting less attractive for borrowers.

Box III.B

Big tech credit assessment: big data and artificial intelligence

Big techs’ lending decisions are linked to the processing of large quantities of information (big data) using advanced
analytical methods such as machine learning and network analysis (artificial intelligence). Big data relevant for
financial services obtained directly from big tech platforms include: (i) transactions (sales volumes and average
selling prices); (ii) reputation-related information (claim ratio, handling time, reviews and complaints); and (iii) industryspecific characteristics (sales seasonality, demand trend and macroeconomic sensitivity). This can be also enriched
by using non-traditional data obtained via social media and other channels.
The predictive power of the big techs’ scoring systems arises in large part from exploiting the network structure.
For instance, MYbank (Ant Financial group) uses network analysis of transactions to evaluate whether an entrepreneur
separates personal funds from business funds, which is one of the basic principles of good business conduct.
Preliminary evidence suggests that the use of more and more granular data with machine learning can help to
improve the predictive power of prepayment prospects, especially for small merchants that are typically not served
by banks. In the case of Mercado Libre, internal ratings are more granular (A to E) than those of the credit bureaus
in Argentina (low-risk to high-risk), which banks rely on but augment with other borrower characteristics and soft
information (Graph III.B, left-hand panel). However, as most of Mercado Libre’s clients are unbanked, the analysis
below is more specific to cases in which traditional soft information collected by banks is not available.

The loss rate is the volume of loans more than 30 days past due relative to the origination volume. In its use to date, the internal rating of
Mercado Libre is better able to predict such losses. It segments the originations into five different risk groups versus the three clusters
identified by the credit bureau. The size of the dots is proportional to the share of the firms in the rating distribution. The horizontal blue lines

shows that the machine learning model has superior predictive power to both the credit bureau score only and the credit bureau score with
borrower characteristics.

Papers, no 779, April 2019.

For a given bureau rating (eg low-risk), the expected loss rate is strictly monotonic with the internal rating
(ie the patterns of the dots show that the internal rating increases with expected loss). Conversely, for a given
internal rating (eg C, D or E), the loss rate is not strictly monotonic with the credit bureau risk. For example, the dot
associated with internal rating D in the low-risk bureau category indicates a higher risk than the internal rating D in
the medium-risk bureau category. Moreover, the internal rating has a broader range, covering losses from 0.0 to
10.2%; the bureau rating ranges from 0.7 to 2.8%.

66

BIS Annual Economic Report 2019

Most importantly, by using the internal scoring model, Mercado Libre is able to provide credit to the profiles
assessed as high-risk by the bureau. The size of the dots in the left-hand panel of Graph III.B is proportional to the
share of the firms in the rating distribution; a substantial number of clients are in the credit bureau high-risk
category. Because banks use a mix of credit bureau information, hard information from financial statements and soft
information from loan officers, this segment may have much less access to traditional banking services. With its
more granular scoring model, Mercado Libre offers 30% of its credit to this category.
Further, the internal rating system based on machine learning techniques and data obtained from the e-commerce
platform can outperform simple models based on bureau score and borrower characteristics in predicting defaults
(Graph III.B, right-hand panel). That said, there are open questions as to whether this performance is superior to
bank models that use also soft information and can be sustained over full business and financial cycles.

 However, empirical evidence suggests that data from social networks may not have the same informational value for credit scoring
models. See S Freedman and G Z Jin, “The information value of online social networks: lessons from peer-to-peer lending”, NBER Working
Papers, no 19820, 2018.     See www.smefinanceforum.org/post/how-is-ant-financial-closing-the-sme-finance-gap-in-china.

Big techs can address these issues differently. When a borrower is closely
integrated in an e-commerce platform, for example, it may be relatively easy for a
big tech to deduct the (monthly) payments on a credit line from the borrower’s
revenues that transit through its payment account. In contrast, banks may not be in
the position to do so as the borrower can have accounts with other banks. Given
network effects and high switching costs, big techs could also enforce loan repayments
by the simple threat of a downgrade or an exclusion from their ecosystem if in
default. Anecdotal evidence from Argentina and China suggests that the combination
of massive amounts of data and network effects may allow big techs to mitigate
information and incentive problems traditionally addressed through the posting of
collateral. This could explain why, unlike banks’, big techs’ supply of corporate loans
does not closely correlate with asset prices (Graph III.6, right-hand panel).

Big techs’ potential costs: market power and misuse of data
Big techs’ role in financial services brings efficiency gains and lowers barriers to the
provision of financial services, but the very features that bring benefits also have
the potential to generate new risks and costs associated with market power. Once a
captive ecosystem is established, potential competitors have little scope to build
rival platforms. Dominant platforms can consolidate their position by raising entry
barriers. They can exploit their market power and network externalities to increase
user switching costs or exclude potential competitors.12 Indeed, over time big techs
have positioned their platforms as “bottlenecks” for a host of services. Platforms
now often serve as essential selling infrastructures for financial service providers,
while at the same time big techs compete with these providers. Big techs could
favour their own products and try to obtain higher margins by making financial
institutions’ access to prospective clients via their platforms more costly. Other
anticompetitive practices could include “product bundling” and cross-subsidising
activities.13 Given their business model, these practices could reach a larger scale for
big techs.
Another, newer type of risk is the anticompetitive use of data. Given their scale
and technology, big techs have the ability to collect massive amounts of data at
near zero cost. This gives rise to “digital monopolies” or “data-opolies”.14 Once their
dominant position in data is established, big techs can engage in price discrimination
and extract rents. They may use their data not only to assess a potential borrower’s
creditworthiness, but also to identify the highest rate the borrower would be willing
to pay for a loan or the highest premium a client would pay for insurance.15 Price

discrimination does not just have distributional effects, ie raising big techs’ profits
at customers’ expense without changing the overall amounts produced and
consumed. It could also have adverse economic and welfare effects. The use of
personal data could lead to the exclusion of high-risk groups from socially desirable
insurance markets. There are also some signs that big techs’ sophisticated algorithms
used to process personal data could develop biases towards minorities.16
The idea that people’s preferences are malleable and are subject to influence
for commercial gain is not new.17 But the scope for such actions may be greater in
the case of big techs, due to their command over much richer customer information
and their integration into their customers’ everyday life. Anecdotal evidence indeed
suggests that big techs may be able to influence users’ sentiment without the users
themselves being aware of it.18

Public policy towards big techs in finance
Traditionally, financial regulation is aimed at ensuring the solvency of individual
financial institutions and the soundness of the financial system as a whole. It also
incorporates consumer protection goals. The policy instruments used to achieve
these goals are well understood, ranging from capital and liquidity requirements in
the case of banks to the regulation of conduct for consumer protection. When big
techs’ activity falls squarely within the scope of traditional financial regulation, the
same principles should apply to them.
However, two additional features make the formulation of the policy response
more challenging for big techs. First, big techs’ activity in finance may warrant a
more comprehensive approach that encompasses not only financial regulation but
also competition and data privacy objectives. Second, even when the policy goals
are well articulated, the specific policy tools should actually be shown to promote
those objectives. This link between ends and means should not be taken for
granted. This is because the mapping between policy tools and the ultimate welfare
outcomes is more complex in the case of big techs. In particular, the policy tools
that are aimed at traditional financial regulation objectives may also impinge on
competition and data privacy objectives, and vice versa. These interactions
introduce potentially complex trade-offs that do not figure in traditional financial
regulation. Each of these issues is explored in turn.

“Same activity, same regulation”
A well functioning financial system is a critical public infrastructure, and banks
occupy a central place in that system through their role in the payment system and
in credit intermediation. Banks’ soundness is a matter of broader public interest
beyond the narrow group of direct stakeholders (their owners and creditors). For
this reason, banks are subject to regulations that govern their activities, and market
entry is subject to strict licensing requirements. Likewise, when big techs engage in
banking activities, they are rightfully subject to the same regulations that apply to
banks. The aim is to close the regulatory gaps between big techs and regulated
financial institutions so as to limit the scope for regulatory arbitrage through
shadow banking activities. Accordingly, regulators have extended existing banking
regulations to big techs. Examples include the extension of know-your-customer
(KYC) rules – designed to prevent money laundering and other financial crimes – to
big techs’ operations in payments.19 The basic principle is “same activity, same
regulation”.20 If big techs engage in activities that are effectively identical to those
performed by banks, then such activities should be subject to banking rules.

In addition to existing rules being extended to big techs, new rules may be
warranted in those cases where big techs have wrought structural changes that
take them outside the scope of existing financial regulation. Prudential regulators
have turned their attention to specific market segments, notably in the payment
system, where big techs may have already become relevant from a systemic
perspective. Where rapid structural change has outrun the existing letter of the
regulations, a revamp of those regulations will be necessary. The general guide is to
follow the risk-based principle and adapt the regulatory toolkit in a proportionate
way. In China, for instance, big techs’ sizeable MMF businesses play an important
role for interbank funding. These MMFs mainly invest in unsecured bank deposits
and reverse repos with banks (see Graph III.7 for the case of Yu’ebao). The rapid
structural change has introduced new linkages in the financial system. Around half
of MMFs’ assets are bank deposits and interbank loans with a maturity of less than
30 days. A risk is thus that a redemption shock to big techs’ MMF platforms quickly
transmits to the banking system through deposit withdrawals. Another concern is
the systemic nature of the payment links when banks are reliant on funding from
payment firms. To address these risks, the authorities in China have introduced new
rules requiring settlement on a common, public platform for all payment firms, as
well as on redemptions and the use of customer balances (Box III.C).

A new regulatory compass
When the objectives of policy extend beyond the goals of traditional financial
regulation into competition and data privacy, new challenges present themselves.
Even when the objectives are clear and uncontroversial, selecting the policy tools to
secure the objectives – the means towards the ends – requires taking account of
potentially complex interactions.

To navigate the new, uncharted waters, regulators need a compass that can
orient the choice of potential policy tools. These tools can be organised along the
two dimensions, or axes, of a “regulatory compass” (Graph III.8). The north-south
axis of the compass spans the range of choices over how much new entry of big
techs into finance is encouraged or permitted. North indicates encouragement of
new entry, while south indicates strict restrictions on entry. The second dimension in

(i) promoting/restricting big techs’ entry into finance (north-south axis); or (ii) endowing customers with data property rights/restricting big
techs’ use of customer data (east-west axis).
For example, in some jurisdictions, competition authorities have been promoting new entry into finance – including by big techs – (north

the compass spans choices over how data are treated in the regulatory approach. It
ranges from a decentralised approach that endows property rights over data to
customers (east), to a restrictive approach that places walls and limits on big techs’
use of such data (west).
Current practices cover a broad territory spanned by the two axes. These
practices are represented as dots in this space. The placement of the dots reflects
the multifaceted nature of the policy choices in that components of the approaches
can be placed in different places on the compass. The choices also involve decisions
by three types of official actors: financial regulators (blue dots), competition
authorities (green dots) and data protection authorities (red dots). As can be seen
in Graph III.8, the choice of policy tools has been quite heterogeneous across
jurisdictions (Table III.3).

according to their effectiveness in achieving the ultimate objectives would require
the further step of analysing the mapping from the policy tools to the ultimate
outcomes. This final step is far from simple given the complex interactions between
the objectives of solvency, competition and data privacy. Nevertheless, the
regulatory compass helps to organise thinking and sheds light on this mapping
between means and ends.

Revisiting the competition–financial stability nexus
Take the concrete example of the interplay between competition objectives and
financial stability objectives. Traditionally, public policy on entry into the banking
industry has been influenced by two divergent schools of thought on the desirability
of competition in banking. One view is that the entry of new firms in the banking
sector is desirable as it fosters competition and reduces incumbents’ market power.
The associated policy prescription is to foster new firms’ entry in the banking
industry by operating a liberal policy on issuing banking licences. Regulators may
also lower entry costs in some specific market segments, especially where the scope
for technological progress is the greatest. In India, for instance, they have favoured
the development of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), which gives authorised
mobile payment providers, including big techs, access to the interbank payment
system.21
On the other side of the debate is the school of thought emphasising that a
concentrated – or less competitive – banking sector is desirable because it is
conducive to financial stability. Incumbents are more profitable – and thus more
able to accumulate a strong equity base – and have a higher franchise value – and
are thus more likely to act prudently. Moreover, they may have access to more
stable (insured) funding bases. The associated policy approach is to restrict new
entry by maintaining strict licensing requirements for new entrants. In the
regulatory compass, the degree of stringency in allowing big techs’ entry is spanned
by the north-south axis, with north being the policy of being permissive towards
new entry while south is the policy of restricting entry.
However, the relationship between entry and effective competition is far from
obvious when the DNA feedback loop is taken into account. New entry may not
increase market contestability – and competition – when big techs are envisaged as
the new entrants. This is because big techs can establish and entrench their market
power through their control of key digital platforms, eg e-commerce, search or
social networking. On the one hand, such control may generate outright conflicts
of interest and reduce competition when both big techs and their competitors
(eg banks) rely on these platforms for their financial services. On the other hand, a
big tech could be small in financial services and yet rapidly establish a dominant
position by leveraging its vast network of users and associated network effects. In
this way, the rule of thumb that encouraging new entry is conducive to greater
competition can be turned on its head.
The traditional focus of competition authorities on a single market, firm size,
pricing and concentration as indicators of contestability is not well suited to the
case of big techs in finance.22 Just as the mapping between policy choices to
outcomes can be complex for financial regulators, competition authorities may also
need to adapt their paradigms. As part of this effort, some jurisdictions (eg the
European Union, Germany, India, the United Kingdom and the United States) have
recently been upgrading their rules and methodologies for assessing anticompetitive
conduct.23 In India, for example, the main e-commerce platforms are prohibited
from selling products supplied by affiliated companies on their websites to avoid
potential conflicts of interest.

BIS Annual Economic Report 2019

73

The new competition–data nexus
By tying market power to the extensive use of customer data, big techs’ DNA
feedback loop creates a new nexus between competition and data.
Abstracting from privacy concerns, wide access to data can in principle be
beneficial. Digital data are a non-rival good – ie they can be used by many,
including competitors, without loss of content. Moreover, since data are obtained
at zero marginal cost as a by-product of big techs’ services, it would be socially
desirable to share them freely.24 Provided that markets are competitive, open access
to data can help to lower the switching costs for customers, alleviate hold-up
problems and generally foster competition and financial inclusion.
The issue, therefore, is how to promote data-sharing. Currently, data ownership
is rarely clearly assigned. For practical purposes, the default outcome is that big
techs have de facto ownership of customer data, and customers cannot (easily)
grant competitors access to their relevant information. This uneven playing field
between customers and service providers can be remedied somewhat by assigning
data property rights to the customers. Customers could then decide with which
providers to share or sell data. In effect, this attempts to resolve inefficiencies
through the allocation of property rights and the creation of a competitive market
for data – the decentralised or “Coasian” solution.25 The east-west axis of the
regulatory compass maps out the range of choices according to the degree to
which authorities rely on allocating property rights to data versus outright
restrictions on the data’s use. The further east one travels, the greater the emphasis
on the decentralised solution based on data portability and data property rights.
However, the mapping between the policy tools and the ultimate outcomes is
more complex in the case of big techs. The DNA feedback loop challenges a
smooth application of the Coasian approach. The reason is twofold. First, big techs
can obtain additional data from their own ecosystems (social networking, search,
e-commerce, etc), outside the financial services they operate. Second, data have
increasing returns to scope and scale26 – a single additional piece of data (eg a
credit score) has more value when combined with an existing large stock of data –
and economies of scope – eg when used in the supply of a broader range of
services. For both reasons, data have more value to big techs. In a bidding market
for data, big techs would most likely outbid their competitors. Letting market forces
freely run their course could not be guaranteed to result in the desired (competitive)
outcomes. Concretely, if banks’ customers were to grant (or sell) big techs
unrestricted access to their banking data, this could reinforce the DNA feedback
loop and paradoxically increase big techs’ competitive advantage over banks, as
opposed to keeping it in check.
Given the network effects underlying competition, the competitive playing
field may be levelled out more effectively by placing well designed limits on the
use of data.27 Introducing some additional rules regarding privacy – while at the
same time allowing selectively for the sharing of some types of data – could
increase effective competition, because the addition of such limitations on the use
of data could curb big techs’ exploitation of network externalities.
This policy choice along the data usage dimension – as represented by the
east-west axis of the regulatory compass in Graph III.8 – has taken centre stage in
the debate on big techs.28 The underlying arguments that bear on the available
choices are reflected in the policies recently adopted in a number of jurisdictions.
Two particular examples are the various forms of open banking regulations that
have been adopted around the world, and the EU’s General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR). Open banking regulations give authorised third-party financial
service providers direct access to bank customer data and – in some cases – banks

74

BIS Annual Economic Report 2019

reciprocal access to third parties’ equivalent data. They also set common technical
standards for APIs, but do not give customers as much control over their personal
data as the GDPR. To the extent that they entail the transfer of data ownership from
big techs to customers, both regulations can be seen as measures intended to
facilitate greater effective market contestability. For this reason, they are positioned
in the northeast quadrant in Graph III.8. Data portability allows customers to
transfer personal data easily across different services and for their own purposes. As
such, it is an important step towards defining the terms of competition in the
financial sector.
At the same time, some of the new regulations also limit the scope of datasharing. Regulations that circumscribe the use of data are positioned in the western
half of the compass. The rationale for limiting the use of data rests on a number of
considerations. For one, not all types of data are relevant for the provision of
financial services. To assess a borrower’s creditworthiness, for example, a lender
may not necessarily need to know their social habits or travel plans. Moreover, not
all types of service providers should be given access to their customers’ financial
data. In any case, there are more fundamental considerations from privacy for limits
on the use of personal data. Accordingly, open banking regulations selectively
restrict the range of data that can be transmitted (eg financial transaction data), as
well as the type of institutions among which such data can be shared (eg accredited
deposit-taking institutions). Similarly, the GDPR requires customers’ active consent
before a firm can use their personal data.29 Both types of restrictions can be seen as
barriers to big techs’ entry into finance. For this reason, they are positioned in the
southwest quadrant of the compass. More drastic approaches involve outright
restrictions on the processing of user data. One example of a policy initiative that
aims at levelling the competitive playing field by limiting the use of data is the
recent rule by Germany’s competition authority that prohibits a prominent social
network from combining its user data with those it collects from its affiliated
websites and applications. Where to draw the line is an issue that involves not just
economics, but also society’s privacy preferences.
The regulatory compass is a useful device to classify the range of policy
initiatives that impinge on the use of data and market entry. However, it remains to
be seen how far these policy initiatives will lead to the desired outcomes in terms
of effective competition, efficiency and soundness of the financial system. A
broadening of perspectives will be essential to make considered policy choices in
this area.

Policy coordination and need for learning
In the face of the rapid and global digitisation of the economy, policymakers need
institutional mechanisms to stay abreast of developments and to learn from and
coordinate with each other.
Some countries have set up innovation facilitators. These can take a number of
forms, including hubs and accelerators, which provide a forum for knowledgesharing, and may involve active collaboration or even funding for new players.
Regulatory sandboxes (eg in Hong Kong, Singapore and the United Kingdom) let
innovators test their products under regulatory oversight. Hubs, accelerators and
sandboxes can help to ensure a dynamic financial landscape – one that is not
necessarily dominated by just a few players. At the same time, their setup requires
careful design and implementation, to avoid regulatory arbitrage and to not
provide signs of support for new but still speculative projects.
Coordination among authorities is crucial, at both the national and the
international level. First, there is a need for coordination of national public policies.

BIS Annual Economic Report 2019

75

The mandates and practices of the three different national authorities – competition
authorities, financial regulators and data protection supervisors – may not always
be compatible. Financial regulators focus on the specifics of the financial sector,
whereas competition and data privacy laws often impose general standards that
apply to a wide range of businesses. Second, as the digital economy expands across
borders, there is a need for international coordination of rules and standards
(eg for data exchange).30 To prevent those differences from leading to conflicting
actions, policymakers not only need a new compass but also need to find the right
balance of public policy tools.

APIs are the typical way to share information with third parties securely and efficiently in the digital
economy. They are pieces of software designed to allow different programs to communicate with
each other and transfer information.

The cost of financial intermediation is typically measured as the income received by financial
intermediaries as compensation for providing services such as the production of information, risksharing, maturity transformation and underwriting. Measures based on a panel of 20 countries
indicate that, in the last decade, the unit cost of financial intermediation has been around 1.5% of
the intermediated assets. See G Bazot, “Financial intermediation cost, rents, and productivity:
An international comparison”, European Historical Economics Society Working Papers, no 141,
November 2018.

Preliminary evidence suggests that small (and typically unbanked) firms in Argentina and China
that received big tech credit expanded their product offerings more than those that did not. See
J Frost et al (2019), op cit.

11

One risk is big techs’ unknown impact on lending over the business cycle. Big techs do not build as
strong long-term relationships with their customers – notably SMEs – as banks do. By having a
lower opportunity cost of severing relationships, big techs could therefore more easily cut SME
lending during downturns. The literature finds that banking systems based on relationships better
protect firms in adverse conditions, especially if banks have sufficient capital, in comparison with
systems characterised by financial intermediaries with transactional type loans. See P Bolton,
X Freixas, L Gambacorta and P Mistrulli, “Relationship and transaction lending in a crisis”, The
Review of Financial Studies, vol 29, issue 10, 2016.

12

To date there is no evidence of big techs hindering their competitors’ provision of financial services
on their platforms. But examples of anticompetitive practices can be found in other sectors of
activity, such as advertising. For example, in March 2019 the European Commission fined a big
tech for imposing a number of restrictive clauses in contracts with third-party websites which
prevented its rivals from placing their search adverts on those websites.

13

Product bundling is a marketing strategy by which a firm offering several products separately also
gives a discount to those consumers purchasing the products as a single combined product (a
“package”). Bundling practices can be seen as a particular form of price discrimination, and are
most often found in multiproduct industries such as telecommunications, hardware and software.

Anticompetitive practices in the telecommunications sector gave rise to a significant overhaul of
telecommunications laws in a number of countries in the 1990s (eg the US Telecommunications
Act of 1996).

Evidence of racial discrimination (for the US) by algorithms is provided in L Sweeney, “Discrimination
in online ad delivery”, ACM Queue, vol 11, issue 3, March 2013. There is also evidence (again for
the US) that black and Hispanic borrowers are disproportionately less likely to gain from the
introduction of machine learning in credit scoring models, suggesting that algorithms may develop
their own biases (see A Fuster, P Goldsmith-Pinkham, T Ramadorai and A Walther, “Predictably
unequal? The effects of machine learning on credit markets”, mimeo, November 2018). The
complex and opaque algorithms render biases particularly difficult to detect, and therefore to
prevent. See C Sandvig, K Hamilton, K Karahalios and C Langbort, “Auditing algorithms: research
methods for detecting discrimination in internet platforms”, mimeo, 2014.

17

The notion that firms may actively change preferences and create wants, eg through advertising
and salesmanship, is already present in J Galbraith, The affluent society, 1958.

Other issues currently under discussion are whether bank deposit insurance and related rules to
safeguard funds should be extended to non-bank payment companies, and whether new
regulations for electronic money are required. Electronic money (e-money) is broadly defined as
prepaid value stored electronically, which represents a liability of the e-money issuer (eg a bank, an
e-money institution or any other entity authorised or allowed to issue e-money in the local
jurisdiction) and is denominated in a currency backed by an authority.

20

Many central banks and supervisors are also exploring ways of using big data analytics to improve
their assessment of financial sector risks and to enhance banking supervision (suptech). Asia is
leading by example. The Monetary Authority of Singapore, for example, is exploring different ways
of using big data, including web scraping techniques. These techniques can come in handy
precisely to disentangle and evaluate the financial stability risks inherent to big techs’ typical
bundling of commercial and financial activities, and to better understand the interplay of such
activities from a risk assessment perspective.

21

To varied degrees, other countries have given – or are planning to give – non-bank payment
system providers access to their real-time gross settlement systems. In Switzerland, for example,
the central bank has recently granted entities with a fintech licence access to the Swiss Interbank
Clearing system (as well as to sight deposit accounts). See Swiss National Bank, “Swiss National
Bank sets criteria for fintech companies’ access to Swiss Interbank Clearing”, press release,
11 January 2019.

22

Traditional indicators of market dominance, such as excessively low or high prices, may not be
indicative of predatory or monopoly pricing. Most big techs indeed start as digital MSPs, by having
one side (eg sellers on an e-commerce platform) subsidise the other (eg buyers). Such pricing
strategies are crucial for a big tech to solve the initial chicken-and-egg problem, reach a critical
mass of users and build a digital network (Box III.A).

23

For example, a competition authority that mechanically prohibits big techs’ specific pricing
strategies could forestall positive network externalities or destabilise established networks. Things
are complicated by big techs’ services not always being priced in monetary terms. For example,
most social networks and search engines are free for users, at least at face value. The effective
price that users pay takes the form of the personal data they provide. See J Cremer, Y-A de
Montjoye and H Schweitzer, “Competition policy for the digital era”, report to the European
Commission, 2019.

For example, a prospective borrower could significantly increase competition and obtain better
deals if they could share relevant information selectively across multiple lenders. However, big
techs have no incentive to share data because of the competitive advantage that their private
usage confers. Note that the notion that information may not be produced ex ante if it is to be
shared for free ex post – which would stifle innovation – is less of an issue in the case of raw digital
data, to the extent that those data are collected at zero marginal cost and are a by-product of a
big tech’s activity, ie would be produced anyway.

The rationale is that when there are several departures from a frictionless market, removing just a
subset of those frictions may not improve overall welfare if the remaining frictions are amplified.
This “theory of the second best” is also the basic theoretical rationale for financial regulation itself.
When there are incentive and spillover problems in the financial system, removing all restrictions
on the activities of financial firms may result in a worse outcome from a welfare perspective due to
financial instability and the broader impact on the economy.

In some jurisdictions, customer privacy laws may also protect digital customer data, and require
customer consent prior to the sharing of data under open banking. This is, for instance, the case in
Australia, the EU and the UK.

30

For example, the Monetary Authority of Singapore has signed fintech cooperation agreements
with authorities in different countries. These agreements include information exchanges with other
regulators and regulated businesses, referrals of firms attempting to enter a regulatory partner’s
market and guidance for companies on the regulations of jurisdictions they wish to enter. More
recently, an international group of financial regulators, including the UK Financial Conduct
Authority, launched the Global Financial Innovation Network, which seeks to provide a more
efficient way for innovative firms to interact with regulators.
