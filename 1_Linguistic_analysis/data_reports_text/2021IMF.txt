ASSUMPTIONS AND CONVENTIONS

A number of assumptions have been adopted for the projections presented in the World Economic Outlook
(WEO). It has been assumed that real effective exchange rates remained constant at their average levels during
July 23, 2021, to August 20, 2021, except for those for the currencies participating in the European exchange
rate mechanism II, which are assumed to have remained constant in nominal terms relative to the euro; that
established policies of national authorities will be maintained (for specific assumptions about fiscal and monetary policies for selected economies, see Box A1 in the Statistical Appendix); that the average price of oil will be
$65.68 a barrel in 2021 and $64.52 a barrel in 2022 and will remain unchanged in real terms over the medium
term; that the six-month London interbank offered rate on US dollar deposits will average 0.2 percent in 2021
and 0.4 percent in 2022; that the three-month euro deposit rate will average –0.5 percent in 2021 and 2022;
and that the six-month Japanese yen deposit rate will yield, on average, –0.1 percent in 2021 and 0.0 percent in
2022. These are, of course, working hypotheses rather than forecasts, and the uncertainties surrounding them add
to the margin of error that would, in any event, be involved in the projections. The estimates and projections are
based on statistical information available through September 27, 2021.
The following conventions are used throughout the WEO:
. . . to indicate that data are not available or not applicable;
–
between years or months (for example, 2020–21 or January–June) to indicate the years or months covered,
including the beginning and ending years or months; and
/
between years or months (for example, 2020/21) to indicate a fiscal or financial year.
“Billion” means a thousand million; “trillion” means a thousand billion.
“Basis points” refers to hundredths of 1 percentage point (for example, 25 basis points are equivalent to ¼ of
1 percentage point).
Data refer to calendar years, except in the case of a few countries that use fiscal years. Please refer to Table F in
the Statistical Appendix, which lists the economies with exceptional reporting periods for national accounts and
government finance data for each country.
For some countries, the figures for 2020 and earlier are based on estimates rather than actual outturns. Please
refer to Table G in the Statistical Appendix, which lists the latest actual outturns for the indicators in the national
accounts, prices, government finance, and balance of payments indicators for each country.
What is new in this publication:
• Data for Andorra have been added to the database and are included in the advanced economies group
composites.
In the tables and figures, the following conventions apply:
• If no source is listed in tables and figures, data are drawn from the WEO database.
• When countries are not listed alphabetically, they are ordered on the basis of economic size.
• Minor discrepancies between sums of constituent figures and totals shown reflect rounding.
As used in this report, the terms “country” and “economy” do not in all cases refer to a territorial entity that is
a state as understood by international law and practice. As used here, the term also covers some territorial entities
that are not states but for which statistical data are maintained on a separate and independent basis.

PREFACE

The analysis and projections contained in the World Economic Outlook are integral elements of the IMF’s
surveillance of economic developments and policies in its member countries, of developments in international
financial markets, and of the global economic system. The survey of prospects and policies is the product of a
comprehensive interdepartmental review of world economic developments, which draws primarily on information
the IMF staff gathers through its consultations with member countries. These consultations are carried out
in particular by the IMF’s area departments—namely, the African Department, Asia and Pacific Department,
European Department, Middle East and Central Asia Department, and Western Hemisphere Department—
together with the Strategy, Policy, and Review Department; the Monetary and Capital Markets Department; and
the Fiscal Affairs Department.
The analysis in this report was coordinated in the Research Department under the general direction of Gita
Gopinath, Economic Counsellor and Director of Research. The project was directed by Petya Koeva Brooks,
Deputy Director, Research Department; and Malhar Nabar, Division Chief, Research Department.
The primary contributors to this report are Philip Barrett, John Bluedorn, Christian Bogmans, Francesca Caselli,
Sonali Das, Niels-Jakob Hansen, Christoffer Koch, Toh Kuan, Giacomo Magistretti, Prachi Mishra, Jean-Marc
Natal, Diaa Noureldin, Andrea Pescatori, Ervin Prifti, Martin Stuermer, Nico Valckx, and Philippe Wingender.

Joseph Procopio from the Communications Department led the editorial team for the report, with production
and editorial support from Christine Ebrahimzadeh, and additional assistance from Lucy Scott Morales, James
Unwin, Harold Medina, and TalentMEDIA Services.
The analysis has benefited from comments and suggestions by staff members from other IMF departments, as
well as by Executive Directors following their discussion of the report on September 28, 2021. However, estimates,
projections, and policy considerations are those of the IMF staff and should not be attributed to Executive
Directors or to their national authorities.

FOREWORD

T

he global recovery continues but the
momentum has weakened, hobbled by the
pandemic. Fueled by the highly transmissible Delta variant, the recorded global
COVID-19 death toll has risen close to 5 million and
health risks abound, holding back a full return to normalcy. Pandemic outbreaks in critical links of global
supply chains have resulted in longer-than-expected
supply disruptions, further feeding inflation in many
countries. Overall, risks to economic prospects have
increased, and policy trade-offs have become more
complex.
Compared to our July forecast, the global growth
projection for 2021 has been revised down marginally to 5.9 percent and is unchanged for 2022 at
4.9 percent. This modest headline revision, however,
masks large downgrades for some countries. The
outlook for the low-income developing country group
has darkened considerably due to worsening pandemic
dynamics. The downgrade also reflects more difficult
near-term prospects for the advanced economy group,
in part due to supply disruptions. Partially offsetting these changes, projections for some commodity
exporters have been upgraded on the back of rising
commodity prices. Pandemic-related disruptions to
contact-intensive sectors have caused the labor market
recovery to significantly lag the output recovery in
most countries.
The dangerous divergence in economic prospects
across countries remains a major concern. Aggregate
output for the advanced economy group is expected
to regain its pre-pandemic trend path in 2022 and
exceed it by 0.9 percent in 2024. By contrast, aggregate output for the emerging market and developing
economy group (excluding China) is expected to
remain 5.5 percent below the pre-pandemic forecast
in 2024, resulting in a larger setback to improvements
in their living standards.
These economic divergences are a consequence of
large disparities in vaccine access and in policy support. While almost 60 percent of the population in
advanced economies are fully vaccinated and some are
now receiving booster shots, about 96 percent of the

population in low-income countries remain unvaccinated. Emerging and developing economies, faced
with tighter financing conditions and a greater risk of
de-anchoring inflation expectations, are withdrawing
policy support more quickly despite larger shortfalls in
output.
Supply disruptions pose another policy challenge.
On the one hand, pandemic outbreaks and weather
disruptions have resulted in shortages of key inputs
and dragged manufacturing activity lower in several
countries. On the other hand, these supply shortages, alongside the release of pent-up demand and the
rebound in commodity prices, have caused consumer
price inflation to increase rapidly in, for example, the
United States, Germany, and many emerging market
and developing economies. Food prices have increased
the most in low-income countries where food insecurity is most acute, adding to the burdens of poorer
households and raising the risk of social unrest.
The October 2021 Global Financial Stability Report
highlights another challenge to monetary policy from
increasing risk taking in financial markets and rising
fragilities in the nonbank financial institutions sector.
A principal common factor behind these complex
challenges is the continued grip of the pandemic on
global society. The foremost policy priority is therefore
to vaccinate adequate numbers in every country and
prevent more virulent virus mutations. As Chapter
1 explains, this will require the Group of Seven and
Group of Twenty countries to fulfill existing dose
donation pledges, coordinate with manufacturers to
prioritize deliveries to COVAX in the near term, and
remove trade restrictions on the flow of vaccines and
its inputs. At the same time, closing the $20 billion
residual gap in grants to fund testing, therapeutics,
and genomic surveillance will save lives now and
keep vaccines fit for purpose. Looking ahead, vaccine
manufacturers and high-income countries should support the expansion of regional production of COVID19 vaccines in developing countries through financing
and technology transfer solutions.
While reducing the likelihood of a prolonged
pandemic is a key immediate global priority, another

International Monetary Fund | October 2021

urgent priority is the need to slow the rise in global
temperatures and contain the growing adverse health
and economic effects of climate change. As Chapter 1
details, stronger concrete commitments are needed at
the upcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26). A policy strategy that encompasses
an international carbon price floor adjusted to country
circumstances, a green public investment and research
subsidy push, and compensatory, targeted transfers
to households can help advance the energy transition
in an equitable way. Just as importantly, advanced
countries need to deliver on their earlier promises of
mobilizing $100 billion of climate financing, annually,
for developing nations.
The pandemic and climate change threaten to
exacerbate the economic divergences among the
world’s economies. Concerted multilateral effort
to ensure adequate international liquidity for constrained economies, and faster implementation of the
Group of Twenty common framework to restructure
unsustainable debt, will help limit these divergences.
Building on the historic $650 billion special drawing
right allocation, the IMF is calling on countries with
strong external positions to voluntarily channel their
special drawing rights into the Poverty Reduction
and Growth Trust. Furthermore, it is exploring the
establishment of a Resilience and Sustainability Trust
that would provide long-term funding to support
countries’ investment in sustainable growth.
At the national level, the overall policy mix should
be calibrated to local pandemic and economic conditions, aiming for maximum sustainable employment
while protecting the credibility of policy frameworks.
With fiscal space becoming more limited in many
economies, health care spending should continue
to be the priority, while lifelines and transfers will
need to become increasingly targeted, reinforced with
retraining and support for reallocation. As health
outcomes improve, policy emphasis can increasingly
focus on long-term structural goals. The analysis in
Chapter 3 shows that investment in basic research
can have far-reaching benefits through faster productivity growth, and it is important to promote the
free flow of ideas and scientific collaboration across
borders.

With debt levels at record highs, all initiatives
should be rooted in credible medium-term frameworks, backed by feasible revenue and expenditure
measures. The October 2021 Fiscal Monitor demonstrates that such credibility can lower financing costs
for countries and increase fiscal space in the near term.
Monetary policy will need to walk a fine line
between tackling inflation and financial risks and
supporting the economic recovery. We project, amid
high uncertainty, that headline inflation will likely
return to pre-pandemic levels by mid-2022 for the
group of advanced economies and emerging and
developing economies. There is, however, considerable heterogeneity across countries, with upside
risks for some, such as the United States, the United
Kingdom, and some emerging market and developing economies. While monetary policy can generally
look through transitory increases in inflation, central
banks should be prepared to act quickly if the risks of
rising inflation expectations become more material in
this uncharted recovery. Central banks should chart
contingent actions, announce clear triggers, and act in
line with that communication.
More generally, clarity and consistent actions can
go a long way toward avoiding unnecessary policy
accidents that roil financial markets and set back the
global recovery—ranging from a failure to lift the
United States debt ceiling in a timely fashion, to disorderly debt restructurings in China’s property sector,
and escalations in cross-border trade and technology
tensions.
Recent developments have made it abundantly
clear that we are all in this together and the pandemic is not over anywhere until it is over everywhere.
If Covid-19 were to have a prolonged impact into
the medium term, it could reduce global GDP by a
cumulative $5.3 trillion over the next five years relative to our current projection. It does not have to be
this way. The global community must step up efforts
to ensure equitable vaccine access for every country,
overcome vaccine hesitancy where there is adequate
supply, and secure better economic prospects for all.
Gita Gopinath
Economic Counsellor and Director of Research

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The global economic recovery is continuing, even as
the pandemic resurges. The fault lines opened up by
COVID-19 are looking more persistent—near-term
divergences are expected to leave lasting imprints on
medium-term performance. Vaccine access and early
policy support are the principal drivers of the gaps.
Rapid spread of Delta and the threat of new variants have increased uncertainty about how quickly
the pandemic can be overcome. Policy choices have
become more difficult, confronting multidimensional
challenges—subdued employment growth, rising
inflation, food insecurity, the setback to human capital accumulation, and climate change—with limited
room to maneuver.
The forecast: The global economy is projected to
grow 5.9 percent in 2021 and 4.9 percent in 2022
(0.1 percentage point lower for 2021 than in the
July 2021 World Economic Outlook (WEO) Update).
The downward revision for 2021 reflects a downgrade for advanced economies—in part due to
supply disruptions—and for low-income developing countries, largely due to worsening pandemic
dynamics. This is partially offset by stronger nearterm prospects among some commodity-exporting
emerging market and developing economies.
Employment is generally expected to continue lagging the recovery in output.
Beyond 2022 global growth is projected to moderate to about 3.3 percent over the medium term.
Advanced economy output is forecast to exceed
pre-pandemic medium-term projections—largely
reflecting sizable anticipated further policy support in
the United States that includes measures to increase
potential. By contrast, persistent output losses are
anticipated for the emerging market and developing
economy group due to slower vaccine rollouts and
generally less policy support compared to advanced
economies.
Headline inflation rates have increased rapidly in
the United States and in some emerging market and

developing economies. In most cases, rising inflation
reflects pandemic-related supply-demand mismatches and higher commodity prices compared
to their low base from a year ago. As discussed in
Chapters 1 and 2, for the most part, price pressures are expected to subside in 2022. In some
emerging market and developing economies, price
pressures are expected to persist because of elevated
food prices, lagged effects of higher oil prices, and
exchange rate depreciation lifting the prices of
imported goods. However, great uncertainty surrounds inflation prospects—primarily stemming
from the path of the pandemic, the duration of
supply disruptions, and how inflation expectations
may evolve in this environment.
Overall, the balance of risks for growth is tilted to the
downside. The major source of concern is that more
aggressive SARS-CoV-2 variants could emerge before
widespread vaccination is reached.
Inflation risks are skewed to the upside and could
materialize if pandemic-induced supply-demand
mismatches continue longer than expected (including
if the damage to supply potential turns out worse than
anticipated), leading to more sustained price pressures
and rising inflation expectations that prompt a fasterthan-anticipated monetary normalization in advanced
economies (see also the October 2021 Global Financial
Stability Report).
Multilateral efforts to speed up global vaccine access,
provide liquidity and debt relief to constrained economies, and mitigate and adapt to climate change remain
essential. Speeding up the vaccination of the world
population remains the top policy priority, while continuing the push for widespread testing and investing
in therapeutics. This would save millions of lives, help
prevent the emergence of new variants, and hasten the
global economic recovery. As discussed in Chapter 1,
an IMF proposal lays out concrete, cost-effective steps
to vaccinate at least 40 percent of the population in
every country by the end of 2021 and 70 percent by

mid-2022.1 It is also crucial to ensure that financially
constrained countries can continue essential spending
while meeting other obligations. The IMF’s recent General Allocation of Special Drawing Rights, equivalent
to $650 billion, provided much-needed international
liquidity. Moreover, doubling down efforts to curb
greenhouse gas emissions is critical—current actions
and pledges are not enough to prevent a dangerous
overheating of the planet. The international community
should also resolve trade tensions and reverse the trade
restrictions implemented in 2018–19, strengthen the
rules-based multilateral trading system, and complete an
agreement on a global minimum for corporate taxes that
halts a race to the bottom and helps bolster finances to
fund critical public investments.
At the national level, the policy mix should continue
to be tailored to local pandemic and economic conditions,
aiming for maximum sustainable employment while
protecting the credibility of policy frameworks.
• Fiscal policy: The imperatives will depend on the
stage of the pandemic (also see the October 2021
Fiscal Monitor). Health care-related spending
remains the priority. As the pandemic persists and
fiscal space is limited in some countries, lifelines and
transfers will need to become increasingly targeted
to the worst affected and provide retraining and support for reallocation. Where health metrics permit,
emphasis should shift toward measures to secure the
recovery and invest in longer-term structural goals.
1

1The 70 percent coverage target by mid-2022 is driven by the
health and economic imperatives of stopping the pandemic as
rapidly as possible. This is higher than the originally proposed 60
percent target for mid-2022 given the rise of more infectious variants. The revised target is consistent with the downside risk scenario
envisioned in the original $50 billion IMF staff proposal released in
May 2021, under which 1 billion additional doses were designated
for low- and lower-middle income countries—and is aligned with
the updated World Health Organization global vaccination strategy.
The national targets may need to be adjusted based on age demographics and policy developments.

International Monetary Fund | October 2021

Initiatives should be embedded in medium-term
frameworks with credible revenue and expenditure
measures ensuring debt sustainability.
• Monetary policy: Although central banks can generally look through transitory inflation pressures
and avoid tightening until there is more clarity on
underlying price dynamics, they should be prepared
to act quickly if the recovery strengthens faster than
expected or risks of rising inflation expectations
become tangible. In settings where inflation is rising
amid still-subdued employment rates and risks of
expectations de-anchoring are becoming concrete,
monetary policy may need to be tightened to get
ahead of price pressures, even if that delays the
employment recovery. The alternative of waiting for
stronger employment outcomes runs the risk that
inflation increases in a self-fulfilling way, undermining
the credibility of the policy framework and creating
more uncertainty. A spiral of doubt could hold back
private investment and lead to precisely the slower
employment recovery central banks seek to avoid
when holding off on policy tightening. By contrast,
monetary policy can remain accommodative where
inflation pressures are contained, inflation expectations are still below the central bank target, and labor
market slack remains. The unprecedented conjuncture
makes transparent and clear communication about
the outlook for monetary policy even more critical.
• Preparing for the post-pandemic economy: Finally, it
is important to deal with the challenges of the postpandemic economy: reversing the pandemic-induced
setback to human capital accumulation, facilitating
new growth opportunities related to green technology and digitalization, reducing inequality, and
ensuring sustainable public finances. Chapter 3
explores one dimension of this policy agenda—the
importance of basic research investment for spurring
productivity growth.

CHAPTER

1

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

The global economic recovery continues amid a
resurging pandemic that poses unique policy challenges
(Figure 1.1). Vaccinations have proven effective at
mitigating the adverse health impacts of COVID-19.
However, unequal access to vaccines, vaccine hesitancy, and higher infectiousness have left many people
still susceptible, providing fuel to the pandemic. The
marked spread of the Delta variant and the threat of
new variants that could undermine vaccine effectiveness make the future path of the pandemic highly
uncertain. This has implications for the resilience of a
recovery already in uncharted territory—characterized
by pandemic-induced supply-demand mismatches that
could worsen with a more protracted health crisis.
Gaps in expected recoveries across economy groups
have widened since the July forecast, for instance
between advanced economies and low-income developing countries. As recoveries proceed, the risks of
derailments and persistent scarring in heavily impacted
economies remain so long as the pandemic continues.
Meanwhile, inflation has increased markedly in the
United States and some emerging market economies.
As restrictions are relaxed, demand has accelerated,
but supply has been slower to respond. Commodity
prices have also risen significantly from their low levels
of last year. Although price pressures are expected to
subside in most countries in 2022, inflation prospects
are highly uncertain. These increases in inflation are
occurring even as employment is below pre-pandemic
levels in many economies, forcing difficult choices on
policymakers—particularly in some emerging market
and developing economies.
The chapter first discusses the global outlook and
risks, before turning to policies needed to address
these challenges.

Near-Term Recovery Continues while the
Pandemic Resurges
GDP growth in the first half of 2021 was broadly in
line with expectations. Outturns for first quarter global
GDP were stronger than anticipated, reflecting continued adaptation of economic activity to the pandemic

and associated restrictions as well as ongoing policy
support in many countries. Momentum, however,
weakened in the second quarter, weighed down by
increasing infections in many emerging market and
developing economies and by supply disruptions.
Expenditure decompositions are consistent with input
shortages contributing to weak investment in the
second quarter (Figure 1.2). Recent high-frequency
data are mixed. They suggest that the recovery continues, but with some softening in the third quarter, even
while broadening across sectors. Services production is
expanding, albeit prone to setbacks (Figure 1.3).
The global growth outlook is revised down for 2021
and is unchanged for 2022. The global economy is
projected to grow 5.9 percent in 2021 and 4.9 percent
in 2022. The 2021 forecast is revised down 0.1 percentage point relative to the July World Economic
Outlook (WEO) Update, reflecting forecast downgrades
to the advanced economy and low-income developing
countries groups, as discussed below.
Vaccine access remains the principal driver of fault
lines in the global recovery, reinforced by the resurgence
of the pandemic. Many advanced economies have seen
remarkable progress in vaccinations since the April
2021 WEO. By contrast, most emerging market and
developing economies have had a much slower rollout,
hampered by lack of supply and export restrictions.
•• Advanced economies have achieved broad availability of vaccines, with hesitancy (rather than
inadequate supply) being the main constraint on
further gains. About 58 percent of the population
in advanced economies has been fully vaccinated
(Figure 1.4). By contrast, the rest of the world has
starkly lower shares of population that are fully
vaccinated against COVID-19, at about 36 percent
in emerging market economies and less than 5 percent in low-income developing countries. In these
economies, vaccine supply and distribution remain
the primary constraints.
•• The forecast assumes that some emerging market
economies will join advanced economies in gaining broad vaccine access in 2021. Most countries
are assumed to acquire broad access by the end of

2022 and some only in 2023. However, it seems
likely that vaccinations alone will not be able to
completely stamp out SARS-CoV-2 transmission,
even though they remain effective against the most
adverse health effects of the pandemic (severe illness
and death). As a result, hospitalizations and deaths
are expected to be brought to low levels everywhere
by the end of 2022 through a combination of
improved access to vaccines and therapies, combined
with more highly targeted and effective precautions.
Some countries may be able to reduce adverse public
health outcomes sooner than others, depending on
country-specific circumstances. The projections are
tempered by the possibility of renewed outbreaks,
particularly before vaccines become widely available.
•• So long as the enormous differences in vaccine access
persist, the inequalities in health and economic outcomes will increase, driving further divergences across
two blocs of countries: those that can look forward
to further normalization later this year (almost all
advanced economies); and those that will struggle
with the adverse health and economic impacts from
resurgent infections. The pressure for booster shots in
countries with already-high rates of vaccination could
further delay access in others still at early stages of

getting first jabs into arms. The continuing wide circulation of the virus, particularly within countries and
populations where vaccination rates are low, poses
threats to health and economic recoveries everywhere.
The World Health Organization is warning that
more transmissible and deadly variants—which could
escape protection from existing vaccines—are likely
to evolve so long as a substantial share of the world
population remains unprotected.
Differences in policy support across countries also
underlay gaps in recovery speeds. Sizable fiscal support
continues in advanced economies, while many emerging market economies are reducing policy support this
year as policy space shrinks with the duration of the
pandemic (Figure 1.5). Major advanced economy central banks are assumed to leave policy rates unchanged
through late 2022 though, in some cases, asset purchases are expected to be scaled back before then—a
process already underway, for example, in Australia
and Canada. Meanwhile, some emerging market
central banks—including in Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and
Russia—have shifted to a less accommodative stance

over 2021, with tightening expected in more countries
over the coming quarters.
•• Policy support has helped create the conditions for
a handoff to private demand in the recovery. Where
deployed, extensive fiscal measures have provided
insurance to households and firms, enabling many to
replenish or build up their savings, and creating the
conditions for private demand to propel the recovery,
particularly in 2022 when the advanced economy
group is projected to shift its fiscal stance toward
tightening. Indeed, household savings accumulated
in excess of the pre-pandemic trend shows a positive
relationship vis-à-vis the extent of fiscal support.
•• Moreover, there are signs that historically low-saving
countries have tended to accumulate greater savings in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis, putting
their finances on firmer footing going forward. The
forecast assumes a smooth handoff from extraordinary
policy support to private activity-led growth, with
some of the additional savings buildup retained in
places where previous saving rates were low. Demand
is assumed to pick up as vaccination coverage rises—
given that vaccines seem to protect against severe illness. The speed with which this happens—and excess
savings are drawn down—will influence the pace of
the recovery and inflationary pressures (if supply is
unable to adjust quickly enough).
International Monetary Fund | October 2021

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Recovery During a Pandemic

The forecast is predicated on financial conditions
remaining supportive. Financial market sentiment has
largely stayed attuned to the policy outlook as the
recovery has proceeded (see the October 2021 Global
Financial Stability Report and Figure 1.6). However,
the high uncertainty around the conjuncture has also
led to heightened sensitivity to any news, in particular
about inflation prospects in advanced economies. The
first quarter of 2021 and a brief period in June saw
a bout of financial market volatility, with investors
repositioning portfolio holdings as they reassessed the
outlook for US inflation and monetary policy. Concerns about the spread of the Delta variant and associated implications for the recovery have also sparked
episodes of volatility.
Even so, the overall picture is still one of broadly
supportive financial conditions. Equity markets are
buoyant, credit spreads remain tight, and net flows
to emerging market economies have hitherto been
broadly stable (particularly into hard currency bond
funds). The global growth forecast is predicated on this
support continuing.
Growth revisions: Vaccine rollout, policy support,
and continued supportive financial conditions constitute the key considerations for the forecasts summarized in Table 1.1.
•• Advanced economies: Growth prospects for 2021 are
revised down compared to the July forecast, largely
reflecting downgrades to the United States (due to
large inventory drawdowns in the second quarter,
in part reflecting supply disruptions, and softening
consumption in the third quarter); Germany (in
part because of shortages of key inputs weighing on
manufacturing output); and Japan (reflecting the
effect of the fourth State of Emergency from July
to September as infections hit a record level in the
current wave). The US outlook incorporates the
infrastructure bill recently passed by the Senate and
anticipated legislation to strengthen the social safety
net, equivalent to about $4 trillion in spending
over the next 10 years. The baseline also includes
expected Next Generation European Union (EU)
grants and loans for EU economies. Across advanced
economies, an anticipated stronger rebound in the
first half of next year, as vaccination proceeds, yields
an upward revision to the growth forecast for 2022.
•• Emerging market and developing economies: The
forecast for the group is marked up slightly compared to the July 2021 WEO Update, reflecting
upgrades across most regions. China’s prospects

for 2021 are marked down slightly due to
stronger-than-anticipated scaling back of public
investment. Outside of China and India, emerging and developing Asia is downgraded slightly
as the pandemic has picked up. Growth forecasts
in other regions have been revised up slightly
for 2021. The revisions in part reflect improved
assessments for some commodity exporters outweighing drags from pandemic developments
(Latin America and the Caribbean, Middle East
and Central Asia, sub-Saharan Africa). Elsewhere,
stronger-than-anticipated domestic demand in key
regional economies further lifts the 2021 forecast
(emerging and developing europe).
•• The growth forecast for the low-income developing country group is marked down 0.6 percentage point relative
to July, with the continuing slow rollout of vaccines as
the main factor weighing on the recovery. IMF staff
analysis indicates that low-income developing countries will require close to $200 billion in spending to
combat the pandemic and $250 billion to regain the
convergence paths they were on prior to the pandemic.
Labor market prospects for low-skilled workers and
youth continue to be relatively bleak compared to
other demographic groups, pointing to increasing
inequality and higher vulnerability to incomes falling
below extreme poverty thresholds within countries in
this group. About 65–75 million additional people are
estimated to be in extreme poverty in 2021 compared
to pre-pandemic projections.

Employment Growth Projected to
Lag the Output Recovery
Labor market recovery is underway, but is uneven.
Labor markets are recovering from a catastrophic
hit in 2020. According to the International Labour
Organization (see ILO 2021a), the decline in hours
worked was equivalent to 255 million full-time jobs
lost. But the pace is uneven across economies and
workers. Employment around the world remains below
its pre-pandemic levels, reflecting a mix of negative
output gaps, worker fears of on-the-job infection in
contact‑intensive occupations, childcare constraints,
labor demand changes as automation picks up in some
sectors, replacement income through furlough schemes
or unemployment benefits helping to cushion income
losses, and frictions in job searches and matching.
Emerging market and developing economies have
been hit harder than advanced economies, on average.
International Labour Organization estimates (see ILO
2021b) suggest that Latin America and the Caribbean
and South Asia were among the regions where declines
in working hours in 2020 were particularly large.
Within economies, employment of youth and
lower-skilled workers remains weaker than that of
prime-age and higher-skilled workers (Figure 1.7).
Women’s employment in emerging market and developing economies remains more adversely impacted
than men’s, while in advanced economies, earlier
differences by gender have largely subsided. Some
of these asymmetric impacts reflect differences in

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Recovery During a Pandemic

Figure 1.7. Labor Markets, by Economy and Worker Groups
(Average percent difference from 2019:Q4 to 2021:Q1)

Employment and participation in labor markets are still below their pre-pandemic
levels, with emerging market and developing economies hit harder than advanced
economies, on average. Developments have been highly unequal across worker
groups, with youth and lower-skilled workers still more impacted.

Note: The bars are derived from year ﬁxed effects in a regression of each

sectoral employment across worker groups. Youth and
lower-skilled workers tend to be employed in sectors
that are more contact-intensive and vulnerable to
automation. These sectors have been more impacted
by the pandemic and are experiencing an acceleration
of the long-term trend toward greater automation (see
Chapter 3 of the April 2021 WEO).
On the supply side of labor markets, participation is also
troublingly lower than pre-pandemic, with historically more
disadvantaged groups again exhibiting worse outcomes.
Youth participation rates are more than 6 percent
lower as of early 2021 in both advanced and emerging
market economies, on average—much greater than the
decline for prime-age workers (Figure 1.7, panel 2).
8

International Monetary Fund | October 2021

Lower-skilled workers’ participation is also depressed.
Similar to the differences in employment by gender,
women’s participation in emerging market and developing economies still shows a larger relative decline than
men’s, while in advanced economies they are roughly
similar. If these participation gaps persist, they could
have severe medium-term implications for economic
inequalities across worker groups. Moreover, if participation does not rebound and firms cannot substitute with
machines undertaking more tasks, it may put greater
upward pressure on wages and prices as employers
compete for scarcer workers.
Employment growth is expected to lag the output
recovery. While recent developments are encouraging,
the employment recovery is expected to lag output
for a large share of economies—reflecting possible lingering health concerns, replacement income
under furlough schemes or unemployment benefits
cushioning income loss, and the accelerated shift to
automation. All advanced economies are expected to
regain pre‑COVID-19 output levels by the end of
2022, but only two-thirds are projected to regain their
earlier employment. Emerging market and developing
economies show a similar pattern (Figure 1.8). This
differential between projected output and employment
recoveries suggests that COVID-19–related structural
shifts may cause an increase in inequality and social
tension, as discussed below.

Rises in Inflation, High Uncertainty
Even as employment rates remain below pre-­
pandemic levels—suggesting substantial labor market
slack—headline inflation rates have increased rapidly
in the United States and in some emerging market
and developing economies in recent months, although
there are differences in the extent of pressures across
countries. In some countries in sub-Saharan Africa and
the Middle East and Central Asia, food prices have
increased significantly amid local shortages and the rise
in global food prices. Core inflation—which removes
the influence of food and energy prices—has also risen
in many countries, but to a lesser extent (Figure 1.9).
To a large degree, the increase in inflation reflects
a combination of pandemic-induced supply-demand
mismatches, rising commodity prices, and policy-related
developments (such as the expiration of last year’s
temporary value-added tax cut in Germany and the
increase in the shelter component of US consumer
prices as rent and mortgage moratoriums expire in some

CHAPTER 1

Figure 1.8. Share of Economies Projected to Regain
Pre-Pandemic Employment and Output Levels by 2022
(Percent)

Almost all advanced economies and a large fraction of emerging market and
developing economies are expected to regain or surpass their pre-pandemic
output levels by the end of 2022. The recovery in employment is instead expected
to lag that of output in a number of countries.

jurisdictions), rather than a sharp drop-off in spare
capacity. In some countries, exchange rate depreciations
have contributed to higher import goods prices.
Supply bottlenecks: The sharp contraction in demand
in 2020 led many businesses to slash orders of intermediate inputs. As the recovery picked up steam in
2021, some producers found themselves flatfooted and
unable to ramp up sufficient supply again quickly; for
example, microchip production relative to demand
remains hampered. Moreover, the world distribution
of shipping containers became highly distorted during
the pandemic, leaving many stranded off their usual
routes. Temporary disruptions (such as the closure of
the Suez Canal, restrictions in ports in China’s Pearl
River Delta following COVID-19 outbreaks, and congestion in the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach)
exacerbated delays in delivery times. Analysis of the
Baltic Dry Index—an index of expenditures related to
international shipping—suggests that the bulk of its
rise over the past few months has been due to supply
factors (Figure 1.10).

to increase in 2021, close to 60 percent above their
low base for 2020. Non-oil commodity prices are
expected to rise almost 30 percent above their 2020
levels, reflecting particularly strong increases in the
price of metals and food over recent months (see also
the Commodity Special Feature for further discussion,
including on the impact of the energy transition on
the markets for metals). Food price rises have unfortunately tended to concentrate in places where food
insecurity is high, putting poorer households under
greater stress and raising the specter of greater social
unrest (Figure 1.12).

prices larger than 100 percent are not shown in the ﬁgure to enhance readability.
The change in food prices is the percent change between March 2019 and March
2021.

Wage growth has been high in some sectors. As the
recovery continues, labor markets have tightened,
making it more difficult for employers in some
countries to fill positions quickly. For example,
the ratio of job openings to unemployed workers
is close to 1 in the United States. Consistent with
a resumption of greater activity, there are signs of
higher wage growth in some sectors—for instance,
leisure and hospitality, retail, and transportation in
the United States (Figure 1.13). At the same time,
wages for individuals with either lower incomes or
lower levels of educational attainment have improved
better-than-average compared to a year ago, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s Wage
Growth Tracker—which follows the same employed
individuals over time, thereby correcting for compositional changes due to entry and exit. Overall, average,
economy-wide nominal wage inflation remains contained (Canada, Germany, Spain, United Kingdom,
United States).
Inflation expectations appear contained across most
economies. Some household survey-based measures, for
example in the United States, have registered a recent
increase in inflation expectations—possibly linked to
rising fuel prices. Moreover, market-implied measures

also point to inflation pressure over a two- to three-year
horizon, consistent with the Federal Reserve’s Average Inflation Targeting policy framework. However,
market-implied medium-term inflation expectations
have so far remained well behaved, hovering around the
levels seen just before the pandemic struck in early 2020
(Figure 1.14).
Inflation outlook: The various indicators discussed
above point to a highly uncertain outlook for inflation
(see Chapter 2 for a more in-depth analysis). In the
baseline projections, across most economies, inflation
is expected to come down to its pre-pandemic range
in 2022, once supply-demand mismatches resolve.
This is motivated by three pieces of evidence: (1) labor
market slack remains large, even as job postings have
increased, with employment rates typically below
their pre-shock levels; (2) in large, advanced economies, inflation expectations are still well anchored,
according to benchmark market-based measures; and
(3) structural factors that have lowered the sensitivity
of prices to shrinking labor market slack—such as
increasing automation—continue to operate or are
even intensifying. However, the lagged pass-through to
broader inflation from higher food and oil prices for
importers means that price pressures are anticipated
to stay elevated into 2022 in some emerging market
and developing economies. In economies where the

stock of vacant dwellings is low, the pandemic shock
and low borrowing costs have also spurred an increase
in house prices. This has already directly impacted
headline inflation in these economies through its
impact on imputed rents and could contribute to more
persistent inflationary pressures if demand remains
high, as it takes time to increase the housing stock (see
Box 1.1 for a detailed look at real estate price dynamics and inflation).
The evolution of inflation expectations in this
uncharted recovery will prove decisive for the inflation
outlook. The aftershocks from the upheaval of 2020
and the prospect of renewed restrictions to slow virus
transmission could translate into more persistent
supply disruptions. Faced with continued rising
demand, firms may increase prices and workers may
bid up wages more broadly than has occurred so
far. More generally, should households, businesses,
and investors begin anticipating that price pressures
from pent-up demand and the many factors outlined
above will persist, there is a risk that medium-term
inflation expectations could drift upward and lead
to a self-fulfilling further rise in prices (as prices and
wages are reset in line with higher inflation expectations). As noted, there are no signs of such a shift,
with expectations still tightly bound to central banks'
stated targets.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Recovery During a Pandemic

Large Differences in Medium-Term Economic
Losses Linger
The differential recovery speeds across economy
groups are likely to leave long-lasting imprints. The
pattern of emerging market and developing economies suffering larger medium-term damages compared
to advanced economies on average—discussed in
Chapter 2 of the April 2021 WEO—persists in the
latest projections.
Output losses: Activity is generally expected to
remain below its pre‑pandemic path through 2023
across economy groups (Figure 1.15, panel 1).
Output in the advanced economy group is projected to return to pre-pandemic trends by 2022
and rise slightly above it thereafter, mainly because
of the anticipated additional policy support in the
United States. The other income groups, however, are
expected to remain below their pre-pandemic paths
throughout the forecast horizon. Moreover, negative output gaps—indicative of slack—are expected
across many economies over the next three years
(Figure 1.15, panel 2). In other words, scarring—
defined as medium-term economic performance
below pre-shock projections—is expected to be
pervasive outside of the advanced economy group
(Figure 1.15, panel 3).
As discussed in Chapter 2 of the April 2021 WEO,
the pattern of medium-term damages across economy groups is different from what was observed after
the 2008–09 global financial crisis. Then, advanced
economies were hit hard and emerging market and
developing economies fared better. Today the reverse
appears likely, consistent with the greater protection against further COVID-19 shocks from more
widespread vaccinations in many advanced economies
and sizable policy support. The better-than-expected
performance in the United States, for example—
where output is anticipated to end up above its
pre-pandemic trend—reflects the impacts of the new
structural investments planned by the government,
upgrading dilapidated infrastructure, and hastening a
green energy transition.
Labor market scarring: A similar picture of lasting
effects emerges when looking at labor markets, suggesting that employment is a major channel through
which economic scarring manifests. As with output,
worse-than-expected employment prospects are concentrated in emerging market and developing economies (Figure 1.15, panel 4).

CHAPTER 1

Early responses to the health and economic crisis are
expected to limit persistent losses. When unpacking
these patterns further, high persistence in output and
employment shocks is anticipated, with revisions this
year passing through almost one-for-one with expectations five years out. Such persistence—particularly
of adverse shocks—has been well-documented in the
recent literature. This feature suggests that actions to
improve output and employment outcomes today are
very likely to pay out dramatically through reduced
scarring. This is especially true when it comes to the
speed of vaccinations—a key driver of medium-term
growth upgrades since April 2021 (Figure 1.16).
Forecasts for medium-term output have been revised
up more for countries with higher vaccination rates.
Additional fiscal support to households and firms in
response to the pandemic since April 2021 is associated with a small downgrade to output, suggesting that
recent countercyclical support has been concentrated
in economies where the recovery lags.

Trade Growing, Imbalances Projected to
Narrow over the Medium-Term
Global trade: Despite temporary disruptions,
trade volumes are expected to grow almost 10 percent in 2021, moderating to about 7 percent in
2022—in line with the projected broader global
recovery. Trade growth is projected to moderate
to about 3.5 percent over the medium term. The
overall trade recovery masks a subdued outlook for
tourism-dependent economies and cross-border
services more generally. As noted in the October
2020 WEO, countries where tourism and travel
account for a larger share of GDP are projected
to suffer larger declines in activity compared to
pre–COVID-19 forecasts. Travel restrictions and
lingering fears of contagion are likely to weigh on
cross-border tourist activity until virus transmission
declines durably.
Global current account balances: As noted in
the 2021 External Sector Report, global current
account balances—the sum of absolute deficits and
surpluses—are set to widen for the second successive year in 2021 following an increase in 2020.
The widening in 2020 reflected the impact of the
pandemic—seen in elevated exports of some goods
(medical equipment, work-from-home electronics,
consumer durables), subdued travel, and lower

Fiscal support refers to additional above-the-line spending and forgone revenues
and liquidity support in response to COVID-19 between March 17, 2021, and June
5, 2021, as a share of GDP. Vaccinations and cases are the difference in the

respectively, between March 31, 2021, and September 28, 2021. Explanatory
variables are standardized to have zero mean and unit standard deviation.

deficit in the United States from the increased
fiscal support and corresponding increases in
surpluses. Current account balances are expected
to narrow over 2022–26, reflecting anticipated
declines in the US deficit and China’s surplus
(Figure 1.17, panel 1).
Global creditor and debtor positions: Stocks of
external assets and liabilities are close to historic highs,
even after allowing for the fact that the substantial
widening as a share of global GDP in 2020 reflects the
large drop in the denominator and valuation changes
(Figure 1.17, panel 2). As noted in the 2021 External Sector Report, this poses risks to both debtor and
creditor economies. The stocks are expected to decline
somewhat in 2021 and shrink modestly thereafter,
consistent with the gradual narrowing of global current
account balances.

Uncertainty Grows as Variants Threaten the
Recovery’s Resilience
The baseline forecast is subject to high uncertainty
regarding the evolution of the pandemic, the outlook for inflation, and the associated shifts in global
financial conditions. The balance of risks suggests that
growth outcomes—over both the near and medium
14

International Monetary Fund | October 2021

term—are more likely to disappoint than to register
positive surprises.
On the downside, the main risk factors are the
following (some of these aspects are explored in alternative scenarios using the IMF’s G20 Model—see the
Scenario Box):
•• Emergence of more transmissible and deadlier
SARS-CoV-2 variants could further re-energize the
pandemic’s spread and intensity, prolonging the
pandemic and precipitating pullbacks of economic
activity. Trade disruptions and supply-demand
mismatches could increase with port closures due
to renewed lockdowns. Early studies suggest that
existing vaccines may show reduced efficacy against
the Delta variant, although their levels of protection
against severe disease still remain high. Roadblocks
in the global distribution of vaccines to countries
still lacking sufficient access, high levels of vaccine
hesitancy in countries with advanced vaccination
campaigns, and any other factors that delay broad
vaccine coverage of the world population, heighten
these risks. Each infection represents another opportunity for the virus to mutate into an even more
detrimental pathogen.
•• More persistent supply-demand mismatches, price
pressures, and faster-than-anticipated monetary policy
normalization: Pandemic-induced supply-demand
mismatches could persist longer than expected, leading to sustained price pressures and rising inflation
expectations. In response, a faster-than-anticipated
monetary normalization in advanced economies
could lead to a sudden tightening of global financial conditions. Compressed volatility and elevated
equity price valuations point to the possibility of
rapid repricing of financial assets in the event of a
reassessment of the outlook (see the October 2021
Global Financial Stability Report). As discussed in the
April 2021 WEO, vulnerable emerging market and
developing economies with large foreign currency
debt and financing needs would be particularly
exposed. Difficulties with rolling over their external
obligations could force abrupt adjustments in these
economies, leading to adverse growth outcomes.
•• Financial market volatility: More generally, in a
context of stretched asset valuations, investor sentiment could shift rapidly because of adverse news on
the pandemic or policy developments. A pressing
concern is the ongoing impasse over the US debt
ceiling. Failure to lift the ceiling before the US Treasury runs out of resources to meet its spending and
debt repayment obligations (estimated by the US

CHAPTER 1

Treasury to occur around mid-October) could have
serious implications for financial markets. Similarly,
large-scale disorderly corporate debt defaults or
restructuring, for instance in China’s property sector,
could reverberate widely.
•• Smaller US fiscal package: The baseline forecast
assumes a fiscal impulse in the United States broadly
consistent with the infrastructure bill recently passed
by the Senate and the administration’s blueprint
to remake the US social safety net. Any significant
change in the size or composition of the fiscal package will have repercussions for US growth prospects
and those of its trading partners.
•• Greater social unrest: Instances of social unrest had
declined during the early phases of the pandemic
but rose in the second half of 2020 and at the
beginning of 2021 (Barrett and Chen 2021). The
causes vary across countries. Frustration with the
handling of the pandemic is juxtaposed in some
cases with the increase in food prices, slow employment growth, and long-standing erosion of trust in
government institutions. A further intensification
could damage sentiment and weigh on the recovery.
Recent turmoil in Afghanistan has worsened the
humanitarian situation in the region and is fueling
a wave of refugees, with the potential to further
increase regional tensions, economic spillovers, and
fiscal strains on host countries.
•• More adverse climate shocks: Climate change, a
principal driver of more frequent and intense
weather-related disasters, already has had visible
immediate impacts, with spillovers beyond the
regions where the disasters strike. Cross-border
migration pressures, financial stresses (including
among creditors and insurers in countries not
directly impacted by a given event), and health care
burdens may rise, with implications that persist long
after the event itself. Against the backdrop of the
ongoing pandemic, climate shocks may pose further
challenges to the global recovery.
•• Cyberattacks: An increase in the spread and destructiveness of cyberattacks involving critical infrastructure could act as further drags on the recovery (as
evinced by recent and damaging ransomware cases),
particularly as telework and automation increase.
•• Intensification of trade and technology tensions:
Geopolitical risks remain elevated. An escalation of
trade and technology tensions, notably between the
United States and China, could weigh on investment and productivity growth, raising additional
roadblocks in the recovery path.

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

On the upside:
•• Faster vaccine production and distribution: Large
amounts of new vaccine supplies are expected to
come online over the coming months, both in terms
of production of existing vaccines and deployment of completely new vaccines. Pledges have
also been made by countries with large stocks of
unused vaccines to donate them. A faster pace of
vaccinations than what is assumed in the baseline
projections would have a direct positive effect on
economic activity. It could also boost the confidence
of consumers and firms, triggering a rise in spending
and investment that would strengthen the economic recovery.
•• Productivity growth spurt: The pandemic has accelerated change across many sectors of the economy
through greater automation and a transformation
of workplaces that can rely more on technology
platforms to conduct work remotely. Productivity
growth could accelerate as a result of these changes
in production, distribution, and payment systems.
More specifically, faster and more effective deployment and implementation of structural investment
plans (for example, in the context of the anticipated public investment push in the United States
and the Next Generation EU plan) could lift the
medium-term growth outlook for regions where
subdued long-term prospects have long been a concern. In turn, this could lead to stronger investment
and more robust near-term growth.

Policy Actions to Strengthen the Recovery
The large divergences in economic losses and the
sizable downside risks surrounding the conjuncture
discussed above call for strong policy effort at both
multilateral and national levels to strengthen global
economic prospects. This section first discusses
multilateral priority actions to address the pandemic
(highlighting vaccine deployment), climate policy, and
international liquidity. It then turns to national policies to complement the multilateral effort. These will
require much more tailoring to country-specific conditions and better targeting, as policy space constraints
become more binding the longer the pandemic lasts.

Multilateral Actions with Positive Spillovers
Global vaccine deployment: The global community
needs to increase its efforts to vaccinate adequate
numbers everywhere. This would save millions of lives
International Monetary Fund | October 2021

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Recovery During a Pandemic

by reducing risks of severe health outcomes and deaths,
lower the risks of new variants emerging, and thereby
add trillions of dollars to the global economic recovery. It would also reduce the expected divergence in
recoveries between advanced and emerging market and
developing economy groups.
•• Most of the currently approved vaccines markedly
lower the risk of severe disease from all current
COVID‑19 variants and thus limit hospitalizations
and deaths. The case of the United Kingdom is
instructive in the effectiveness of large-scale vaccination campaigns, even against highly contagious
variants. Although the number of confirmed daily
COVID-19 cases in July 2021 was higher than that
seen in December 2020 for most of the month
(reflecting the greater infectiousness of the Delta
variant), hospitalization and death rates were only
10–20 percent of the levels registered last winter
(Figure 1.18). The key difference between the two
points in time is that the United Kingdom had fully
vaccinated about half of its population (two-thirds
at least partially vaccinated) by July 2021, whereas
in 2020 there was no vaccine protection available.
•• In addition to preventing severe health outcomes,
recent evidence from the United States suggests that
widespread vaccinations can also have powerful,
positive economic effects, bolstering the recovery.
US counties where first-dose vaccinations went up
showed a simultaneous boost in weekly credit card
spending and a decline in weekly unemployment
claims (Figure 1.19).
•• The IMF has proposed a plan—jointly endorsed by
the World Health Organization, the World Bank,
and the World Trade Organization—to vaccinate at
least 40 percent of the population in every country
by the end of 2021 and 70 percent by mid-2022,
alongside ensuring adequate diagnostics and
therapeutics (Agarwal and Gopinath 2021).1 At an
estimated cost of about $50 billion, the plan has
the potential to yield massive social and economic
1

1The 70 percent coverage target by mid-2022 is driven by the
health and economic imperatives of stopping the pandemic as
rapidly as possible. This is higher than the originally proposed 60
percent target for mid-2022 given the rise of more infectious variants. The revised target is consistent with the downside risk scenario
envisioned in the original $50 billion IMF staff proposal released in
May 2021, under which 1 billion additional doses were designated
for low- and lower-middle income countries—and is aligned with
the updated World Health Organization global vaccination strategy.
The national targets may need to be adjusted based on age demographics and policy developments.

returns. Over half of the countries in the world—
accounting for 35 percent of global population—are
not on track to achieve the 40 percent mark by the
end of 2021 (Figure 1.20). There is an urgent need
for vaccine donations by countries with large shares
of their population already vaccinated. The IMF
proposal estimates that at least 1 billion doses could
be shared by the end of 2021 without jeopardizing national vaccination targets. Recent pledges by
China, the Group of Seven, and other countries in
that direction are welcome steps, though donations
should be accelerated to rapidly fulfill the commitments (by mid-September, only about 19 percent
of the 850 million doses pledged by the Group of
Seven to COVAX in June has been delivered). It is
also crucial to prioritize vaccine deliveries to countries
that still lack wide access—including by enhancing
supply to collective procurement vehicles, such as
COVAX. Quickly removing remaining restrictions on
exports of medical equipment, raw materials, and
finished vaccines is another priority. Diversifying
and increasing vaccine production and distribution
capabilities (including via at-risk investments in
doses on behalf of low-income developing countries)

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

are important to speed up the broad coverage of the
world population. Such actions would enhance readiness to react and adapt to unexpected turns in the
pandemic, including the potential need for booster
shots if immunity wanes or new variants emerge.
More generally, it remains crucial to increase funding for testing, tracing, and therapeutics to improve
diagnostics and treatment while scaling up genomic
surveillance for early detection of new variants.
Any actions that help contain and mitigate the
health effects from SARS-CoV-2 increase further in
importance as the likelihood that the virus becomes
endemic rises with the persistence of the pandemic.
Mitigating and adapting to climate change: The past
few months have witnessed a panoply of extreme
weather-related events, including the heat domes and
intense wildfires in Canada and the United States, high
precipitation and flooding in Europe, drought in Brazil,
and floods in eastern and south Asia. Combined with
evidence from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change that the world is experiencing the warmest
period in over 100,000 years, these events have further raised fears that the highly adverse consequences
of climate change may arise sooner rather than later,
increasing the urgency of actions to reduce these risks
and improve resilience.
•• Greenhouse gas emissions due to human activity
are on a steep upward trajectory—with the dip due
to the acute pandemic rapidly reversing. Commitments and realized actions to reduce emissions must
be ramped up. The existing nationally determined
contributions for reductions in greenhouse gas
emissions are insufficiently ambitious, remaining far
above the level consistent with capping the average
global temperature increase at 2 degrees Celsius
above pre-industrial levels—a commonly agreed
limit to contain the risks of catastrophic effects from
warming (Figure 1.21, panel 1).
•• Moreover, there are still few signs of concrete actions
in aggregate policy measures—tax revenue related
to environmental policy objectives as a share of
GDP have tended to decline on average over the
past 15 years, while public expenditures on environmental policy objectives as a share of GDP have
stayed largely flat (Figure 1.21, panel 2). Similarly,
even though there has been a sizable increase in
the coverage of greenhouse gas emissions subject to
control under emissions trading schemes or similar
carbon pricing measures in recent years, only about

•• The global and multifaceted nature of the climate
change challenge requires a well-coordinated
policy response, for which the upcoming United
Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) is
an excellent opportunity to negotiate and make
concrete. An ideal policy mix would include: (1) an
international carbon price floor adjusted to country
circumstances—a transparent and effective instrument that can tilt the balance of incentives away
from the most polluting energy sources; (2) a green
public investment program and research subsidies
to support the development and deployment of
18

International Monetary Fund | October 2021

new clean energies and low-carbon technologies—
from renewables to hydrogen and longer-lasting
and faster-charging batteries to carbon capture,
utilization, and storage systems; and (3) targeted
transfer schemes that ensure a fair and equitable
transition by channeling back some of the revenues from carbon pricing to households adversely
affected by the climate policies implemented while
maintaining the behavioral incentives to shift their
consumption bundle. As discussed in Chapter 3
of the October 2020 WEO, a green infrastructure push at the current conjecture is a win-win
strategy that can strengthen the recovery from the
pandemic through investment with high returns—
both in terms of output and employment—while
tackling one of the major challenges of our times
(also see Chapter 3 of the October 2021 Global
Financial Stability Report on the role of sustainable
finance in facilitating the energy transition). At the
same time, multilateral support via cross-border
technology transfer and climate finance initiatives
can help ensure that the transition is not limited
only to countries that can afford such mitigation
measures. An analysis of employment according to
the tasks involved in occupations and whether they
would be directly impacted by the green transformation of the economy suggests that the green task
intensity of the average job has picked up slightly
over the past 10 years, to just under 2.5 percent.
Green jobs are present in all sectors, but more so in
industry, with workers in those jobs having higher
skills and incomes, pointing to complementarities
between investing in people and greening the economy (Box 1.2).
Easing financial constraints of struggling countries
and tackling debt vulnerabilities: The months of
health emergency and subdued global economic
activity have entailed substantial public finance
interventions, stretching budgets and posing enormous challenges to countries that entered the
pandemic with already-limited fiscal space. The IMF
has stepped in by providing more than $110 billion
in new financing to 86 countries since the early
phases of the pandemic. A further boost to countries’ reserve assets came from the General Allocation
of Special Drawing Rights equivalent to $650 billion that took place in late August, with emerging
market and developing economies receiving about
40 percent of the allocation (and potentially more

CHAPTER 1

through voluntary channeling of special drawing
rights from countries with stronger external positions). These and other initiatives by the IMF and
the international community—including the Debt
Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) by the Group of
Twenty, extended to December 2021—are helping
countries avoid even larger reductions in essential
health care–related spending while meeting their
external payment obligations (see the October 2021
Fiscal Monitor). Nevertheless, in cases where sovereign debt is not sustainable or where financing needs
are large, liquidity relief may not be enough. The
Common Framework for Debt Treatments beyond
the DSSI endorsed by the Group of Twenty last year
aimed to provide a mechanism for timely and orderly
debt restructurings that can prevent the higher costs
of protracted debt crises, but its implementation in
the initial country cases has been too slow, calling for
urgent improvements in this area given the expiry of
the DSSI at the end of 2021.
Defusing trade and technology tensions and instituting
an international minimum corporate tax: Many of the
cross-border trade and technology frictions that predate
the pandemic continue to fester. The increased trade
restrictions implemented in 2018–19, for example,
remain in place and risk impeding the recovery.
Countries should cooperate to remove these
restrictions, address the grievances at the root of
long-standing disputes, and strengthen the rules-based
multilateral trading system—including by resolving
the impasse over appointments to the World Trade
Organization’s Appellate Body. In parallel, they should
finalize an agreement on a global minimum for corporate taxes, avoiding a race to the bottom and helping
bolster public finances to fund critical investments.

National-Level Policies Adjusted to Pandemic Conditions
and Policy Space Constraints
Quick and strong policy actions at the national level
thwarted even worse economic outcomes through last
year’s recession and have fostered the recovery from
that unprecedented collapse. As discussed in the April
2021 WEO, without the direct fiscal actions and
liquidity support policies implemented across Group of
Twenty economies in 2020, the contraction in global
activity could have been at least three times worse than
the actual outcome. Moreover, extraordinary monetary
policy actions—including, for the first time, asset purchases by many emerging market central banks—and

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

regulatory efforts to support credit helped prevent a
systemic financial crisis.
Reduced policy space, tighter constraints: These actions
have, however, reduced policy space in many countries,
leaving them with limited room to address any further
setbacks. Public debt has gone up significantly across
all income groups (see the October 2021 Fiscal Monitor), while inflation has also increased sharply in many
countries. However, the pandemic is far from over and
its path subject to high uncertainty—the prospects for
a protracted stop‑and‑go recovery cannot be excluded.
National‑level policies to support the recovery confront
difficult choices in this environment and, especially for
emerging market and developing economies, generally
must work within tighter constraints than at the onset
of the crisis.
A policy approach tailored to a country’s pandemic and
economic conditions: The priority must remain critical
health care spending—on the rollout of vaccines, testing, and treatments—with targeted emergency support
to households and firms most impacted by public health
measures to contain the spread of the virus. International aid may be required in those economies where
fiscal constraints or local capacities do not permit more
action to safeguard lives. The longer the pandemic persists, resources will also need to be increasingly devoted
to worker retraining and support for reallocation away
from sectors struggling to regain pre-pandemic vitality.
Even when the pandemic’s ferocity abates, the steady
rollout of vaccines and investments to fortify human
health must proceed to help secure the recovery against
future resurgences. Broad-based demand support and
remedial measures to address the scars from the shock
can be deployed to further bolster the economy, as policy space allows. This will also be the time to invest in
the future, taking the opportunity to advance long-term
goals and improve the economy’s potential and resilience. Health metrics—such as infection, hospitalization, and mortality rates, as well as the population share
protected by vaccines—can help policymakers recognize
how and when to adapt policies.
Recognizing the constraints by country: Beyond
the recurring ups and downs of the pandemic, the
uncharted nature of the recovery further complicates
policymaking. Standard dashboard measures to assess
the cyclical position—such as the output gap—are
subject to even greater uncertainty than in a typical
business cycle. Near‑term macroeconomic policies
should aim for the maximum level of employment
without compromising the credibility of policymaking
International Monetary Fund | October 2021

19

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Recovery During a Pandemic

institutions while ensuring fiscal sustainability and
financial stability. At the same time, near-term policies
should be designed to work seamlessly alongside
measures to promote longer-term objectives of stronger
and more equitable growth and resilience. Specifically:
•• Fiscal policies should be undertaken within
medium-term frameworks to improve tradeoffs
between providing cyclical support now, building
buffers to address future shocks, and advancing
long-term structural goals. Fiscal frameworks featuring a clear operational rule, a medium-term debt
anchor reinforced with pre-approved revenue and
expenditure measures to be implemented after the
acute phase of the crisis fades, and well-articulated
escape clauses can enhance countercyclical stabilization while strengthening credibility (October 2021
Fiscal Monitor).
•• Fiscal policymakers should continue to prioritize
spending to end the pandemic—including on
vaccine production and distribution infrastructure;
storage and dispensing facilities; campaigns to
boost take-up; and health workers to implement
vaccinations, testing, and therapies. The longer the
pandemic persists, fiscal space constraints will bind
tighter in some countries. Lifelines, transfers, and
short-time work programs will need to become
better targeted. To facilitate worker reallocation from
shrinking to growing sectors, hiring subsidies, job
search and matching assistance, and training, alongside critical income support for displaced workers, will need to be deployed. As the pandemic is
brought under control, the emphasis can be shifted
toward measures to secure the recovery and invest in
the future, as fiscal space allows.
•• Where fiscal space is more limited—particularly
in some emerging market and developing
economies—poorly targeted subsidies and recurrent
expenditure will need to be pared back to create
room for needed health care and social spending
and infrastructure outlays. These efforts can be
reinforced with initiatives to strengthen tax compliance and improve revenue administration. As
noted, strong international support, particularly for
vulnerable economies, will be needed to supplement
domestic initiatives.
•• Monetary policy should not lose sight of central
bankers’ hard-won credibility for maintaining price
stability. As the recent experience with large-scale
asset purchases has demonstrated, independent
central banks with credible policy frameworks can
20

International Monetary Fund | October 2021

implement countercyclical support more effectively
in downturns, highlighting their value in responding
to shocks (Box 1.3). The unprecedented conjuncture makes transparent and clear communication
about the outlook for monetary policy even more
critical. In particular, clear central bank communications about the persistence of inflation drivers, any
changes in views about inflation, and the monetary
policy outlook will continue to be critical to shaping
expectations.
•• Although central banks can generally look through
transitory inflation pressures and avoid tightening until there is more clarity on underlying price
dynamics, they should be prepared to act quickly
if the recovery strengthens faster than expected—as
the Bank of Canada did when it scaled back its asset
purchase programs in April and July. Early preemptive action will be required where there is a tangible risk of rising inflation expectations and more
persistent price increases.
•• Central banks with dual mandates in economies
confronting rising inflation against the backdrop of
still-subdued employment rates and labor market
slack face particularly difficult choices. The response
in such a setting, where the risks of inflation expectations de-anchoring rise significantly, may be to tighten
monetary policy to get ahead of price pressures, even
if that means the employment recovery is delayed.
The alternative of waiting for stronger employment
outcomes while allowing price pressures to build runs
the risk that inflation increases in a self-fulfilling way,
creating more uncertainty and undermining the credibility of the central bank—which could hold back
private investment and lead to precisely the slower
employment recovery that the central bank hopes to
avoid by waiting to tighten policy.
•• In economies where the recovery is strengthening,
inflation has risen, and health protections—such as
widespread vaccinations—are an effective bulwark
against the pandemic, central banks can more
forcefully signal forthcoming monetary policy
normalization. In the United States, the baseline
forecast is for a strong, sustained recovery with
output expected to exceed potential over much of
the forecast horizon. As this solidifies, the Federal
Reserve should communicate a scaling back of asset
purchases and begin tapering in late 2021 to prepare
for a policy rate liftoff in late 2022. By contrast,
where inflation pressures are contained, inflation
expectations are still below the central bank target,

CHAPTER 1

Financial sector policies and resolution frameworks:
Measures to support credit and stabilize balance
sheets—including credit guarantees, debt moratoria,
and release of capital and liquidity buffers—should
become more targeted (see the October 2021 Global
Financial Stability Report). Support can be focused,
for example, on smaller but viable banks and firms in
sectors where the recovery is lagging because of ongoing health-related concerns. At the same time, policy­
makers should strengthen out-of-court mechanisms
to expedite resolution of debt overhangs—facilitating
capital reallocation and reducing the risk of keeping
low-productivity zombie firms afloat.
Preparing for a possible tightening of external financial
conditions: Although the exact timing may be hard
to predict, the strengthening recovery in advanced
economies presages an eventual end to the extraordinary monetary support and rising yields. Emerging
market and developing economies should prepare
for a possible increase in advanced economy interest
rates through debt maturity extensions where feasible, thereby reducing their rollover needs. Regulators
should also focus on limiting the buildup of balance
sheet mismatches. In countries with deep financial
markets and low balance sheet mismatches, exchange
rate flexibility can help absorb shocks while also permitting monetary policy to address domestic macroeconomic conditions. Foreign exchange intervention
and temporary capital flow management measures may
be useful, however, in some circumstances in countries
with balance sheet vulnerabilities and market frictions.
These measures can increase the autonomy of monetary policy to respond to domestic inflation and output
developments (Adrian, Gopinath, and Pazarbasioglu
2020), but they should not substitute for needed
macro­economic adjustment.

Preparing and Investing for the Longer-Term,
Post-Pandemic Economy
Even as the pandemic re-intensifies and its duration
is highly uncertain, the challenges policymakers will
face in the economy after the health crisis fades are
becoming increasingly visible. If downside risks to
the pandemic’s evolution materialize, there could be
a need for permanently higher health care spending

(including medical infrastructure) to adapt to a more
adverse disease environment. Outside of these potential changes, key challenges include facilitating new
growth and productivity opportunities related to green
technology and digitalization, reversing the setback to
human capital accumulation, and containing increases
in inequality. At the same time, elevated debt levels
in many countries will require efforts to place public
finances on a sustainable footing. Once economies are
more firmly on durable recovery paths, policies will
need to more strongly address these challenges.
•• Facilitating new growth opportunities by greening the
economy and through digitalization: As discussed
earlier, a green investment push would aid the
transition to a cleaner economy while catalyzing
new growth opportunities, for example, in the
construction and energy sectors. Moreover, investing
in broadband to improve access to the internet can
help bridge the digital divide (Figure 1.22). Building on the policies to secure the recovery, structural
reforms that reduce labor market rigidities, repair
balance sheets, and improve competition can also
help reallocate resources toward growing sectors and
raise long-term productivity.

from temporary school closures (Figure 1.23) could
potentially have long-lasting effects on individual
earnings and aggregate productivity growth. To
reverse the setback to human capital accumulation and long-term potential, policymakers may
need to try a variety of strategies, including greater
time in school over the next few years, additional
teacher training on methods to aid catch-up, and
expansion of extracurricular tutoring programs (see
J-PAL 2019 and World Bank 2020a for examples
of strategies and tools). Furthermore, educational
and vocational programs may need to be adapted to
evolving post-pandemic labor demand, with facility
with digital technologies becoming a feature of more
jobs and greater anticipated employment needs in
sectors requiring more specialized skills (such as
health care).

22

International Monetary Fund | October 2021

•• Reducing inequality: The setback to human capital accumulation is one dimension along which
inequality is likely to increase as a result of
the pandemic. Beyond policies to improve educational achievement, spending measures that can
improve the resilience of individuals and households
and lower inequality include greater coverage of
social assistance—via conditional cash transfers,
in-kind food benefits, and medical coverage for
low-income households—and expanded social
insurance (including unemployment benefits for the
self-employed and gig workers and greater availability of paid family and sick leave).
•• Addressing sovereign debt overhangs: The room
for initiatives to address the challenges of the
post-pandemic economy is limited in many
instances, particularly among emerging market and
developing economies. Even with relatively low
interest rates, emerging market economies’ overall
debt service burdens are set to rise because of the
large increase in the stock of debt over the pandemic. Governments with large debt stocks and high
interest burdens will need to institute both revenue
and expenditure measures to alleviate the situation. On the revenue side, these include increasing
progressive income taxes, reducing loopholes and
deductions, adopting well-designed value-added
taxes, and expanding the tax base—by relying more
on e-filing, for instance, and building capacity for
property taxation. These initiatives can be complemented with efforts to scale back poorly targeted
subsidies and improve the governance of public
investment (for instance, through greater transparency and disclosure of procurements, instituting
specific budget lines, and subjecting the projects to
regular audits). Such measures will be particularly
relevant for low-income developing countries where
advancing toward their Sustainable Development
Goals remains an overarching challenge. As noted
earlier, the international community will need to
play a more active role in supporting these countries, including through debt restructuring and
reprofiling where needed.

CHAPTER 1

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

Scenario Box 1. Downside Scenarios
This box examines two downside scenarios: first,
US inflation expectations rising more than expected
over the next three years; second, the implications
of living with endemic COVID-19 well into the
medium term.
Risk of rising US inflation expectations: Although
inflation expectations have been relatively well
anchored in most industrial countries for an extended
period, a confluence of factors are starting to line up,
as discussed in Chapters 1 and 2. These factors appear
to be particularly pressing in the case of the United
States. High current US inflation, a real risk that
inflation could remain persistently high, and some
uncertainty about exactly how tolerant the Federal
Reserve will be of this high inflation could lead to a
persistent shift upward in inflation expectations.
The IMF’s G20 Model is used here to consider the implications of a sequence of unexpected
½-percentage-point shocks to US inflation expectations over 2022–24. The shocks then fade out over
2025–26. The expectations-driven inflation surprises
are assumed to overshoot the Federal Reserve’s comfort
zone suggested by its new average-inflation-targeting
framework, causing it to respond. Higher policy rates
and an increase in the term premium yield higher
long-term rates in the United States (almost 100 basis
points above baseline at its peak). These are transmitted globally, based on empirical spillover analysis.
Monetary policy in Japan and the euro area is assumed
not to respond (because space is exhausted); the same
is assumed for emerging market economies (for fear of
triggering capital outflows). The simulated impact is
shown in the blue line in Scenario Figure 1.1. Furthermore, country-­specific risk premiums are assumed to
increase, based on the IMF staff assessment of relative
vulnerabilities (peaking at 150 basis points on average
in 2024). The impact is shown in the red line.
These factors lead to US output below baseline
by almost 1¼ percent by 2026. At the global level,
output is also below baseline by roughly 1¼ percent by 2026. Emerging market economies suffer
disproportionally: GDP falls by just over 1½ percent at its trough, roughly four times more than the
decline in GDP in advanced economies excluding the
United States.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Recovery During a Pandemic

Scenario Box 1 (continued)
Endemic COVID-19: The second downside scenario
explores the possible implications of having to live
with COVID-19 well into the medium term. The
motivation for this scenario is twofold. First, vaccinations, although critical in the fight, will not, on their
own, put an end to the virus’s circulation. Second,
constraints on vaccine availability and vaccine hesitancy mean that there is likely to be a significant number of unvaccinated people for an extended period.
Constantly having to live with COVID-19 means
that activity in many contact-intensive sectors may
never return to pre-pandemic levels and that significant adjustments are likely to be required. To estimate
how this adjustment might unfold, the standard
SEIRD model with vaccines was extended in several
dimensions to incorporate recent news about the effectiveness of vaccines and vaccine penetration.
The analysis assumes that vaccine efficacy against
infections wanes over time to only 50 percent after six
months; infected nonvaccinated people are 40 percent more infectious than infected vaccinated people;
infectiousness of the virus is as high as the Delta
variant; vaccines are 100 percent effective against
deaths in the first six months and then 90 percent
effective after that; and vaccine hesitancy will limit the
fully vaccinated share, even once the virus becomes
endemic. Surveys are used to estimate final shares of
populations fully vaccinated. Further, it is assumed
that people would voluntarily reduce their mobility
so that deaths are 50 percent lower than they would
be with pre-pandemic levels of mobility. Moreover, as
companies improve their hybrid work models and teleworking technologies improve, the elasticity of GDP
to mobility is further reduced and is only one-third of
the elasticity observed in 2021:Q1.
The estimated declines in domestic demand from
the SEIRD model-based analysis under the above
assumptions are mapped into the IMF’s G20 Model
to estimate the global impact including spillovers via
trade. The simulated results are presented in the blue
line in Scenario Figure 1.2. In addition to the direct
demand impact of reduced mobility, structural changes
will be needed to minimize the impact of the virus
over the medium term. Some of the existing capital
stock will no longer be viable, and new capital will
need to be put in place. Productivity growth will be
temporarily reduced as firms adjust to the additional
constraints. The natural rate of unemployment will
likely rise as labor is reallocated. The scenario assumes
these forces will be roughly half as large as has been

assumed for baseline scarring effects. The estimated
additional impact of these structural changes is given
by the red line in Scenario Figure 1.2.
These factors are estimated to take more than
1 percent off the level of global GDP by 2025, with
a gradual recovery back toward baseline starting
subsequently. Advanced economies are more negatively
impacted than emerging market economies owing to
the estimates of vaccine hesitancy.

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

CHAPTER 1

Box 1.1. House Prices and Consumer Price Inflation
Steady as She Goes
Contrary to the expectation that house prices would
decline during recessions (Igan and others 2011; Duca,
Muellbauer, and Murphy, forthcoming), real house
prices rose by 5.3 percent, on average, globally in 2020
as the pandemic-induced economic downturn took
hold. Perhaps more strikingly, this was the highest
annual growth rate observed in the past 15 years
(Figure 1.1.1). While house price growth has breezed
ahead, residential rents have grown at a slower rate,
rising by 1.8 percent, on average, across countries over
the same period.1
2

Implications of a hot housing market for
consumer prices
The house price surge comes at a time when
questions are mounting over post-pandemic inflation dynamics (see Chapter 2). House prices matter
for inflation because—through an asset pricing
equation—they are linked to two measures of housing
costs that could enter the CPI. One is the actual rent
paid by tenants. The other is the imputed rent, or
owner’s equivalent rent, which is an estimate of how
much homeowners would need to pay were they
to rent their own house.2,3 Overall, the rent component accounts, on average, for about 20 percent
of the CPI.4

How much of an increase in inflation is expected?
To what extent house prices feed into the
rent-based components in the CPI is a question of
the nature and persistence of the observed dynamics.5

house price growth and CPI rent inflation suggests

and Deniz Igan.
1Rents are proxied by the rent expenditure component of
the national consumer price index (CPI) due to lack of data
availability on market rents across countries. It is worth noting
that the proxy used for the CPI could diverge from the rental
rates asked by landlords. In the United States, for instance, the
rent index (based on data from apartmentlist.com) recorded a
monthly average increase of 0.18 percent in 2017–19, compared
to the 0.3 percent average monthly increase in the rent of
primary residence component in the CPI (as published by the
Bureau of Labor Statistics). The two series diverged considerably
in 2020, with the rent index declining by 1.2 percent and the
rent of primary residence component increasing by 1.8 percent.
This large divergence in part may reflect the policy support
measures banning evictions during the pandemic.

2There is variation in how different countries incorporate
either of these components in their inflation measures. Some
include only the actual rent; others also include imputed rent.
Data on these subcomponents of the national CPI series are
available for 45 countries, of which only one-third consider
imputed rental cost in addition to actual rental costs in the calculation of the CPI. House prices themselves are not included in
the CPI because house purchases are regarded as investment, not
consumption. Also, while many countries use the rental equivalence method to estimate the cost of owner-occupied housing, a
few (for example, Australia and New Zealand) use the net acquisition approach with the aim of capturing the cost of purchasing
a dwelling, excluding the land component but including transfer,
insurance, and maintenance costs.
3From a theoretical perspective, owner’s equivalent rent
overstates the cost of owner-occupied housing because it fails to
account for capital gains from, and the favorable tax treatment
of, homeownership (Dougherty and van Order 1982; Muellbauer
2011). The theoretically superior alternative of user cost is difficult
to implement in practice given challenges in measuring expected
capital gains and risk premiums.
4This weight ranges from 14 to 49 percent across countries,
with 15 percent and 23 percent being the 25th and 75th
percentiles, respectively. In most cases where owner-occupied
costs are approximated by the rental equivalence method, this
excludes other shelter-related expenditures, such as maintenance
and utilities.
5Rents are not as procyclical as prices (see, for example,
Glaeser and Nathanson 2015). Plausible explanations include the
non-forward-looking nature and stickiness of rents (for example,
due to long-term rental contracts or regulatory limits on annual
rent increases to protect tenants).

that a 1-percentage-point, year-on-year increase
in nominal house prices in the quarter ahead is
associated with a cumulative increase of 1.4 percentage points in annual rent inflation over a period
of two years (Figure 1.1.2).6 The effect is strongest
in the fourth quarter following the increase and
persists for about three years. Then, considering
that rent costs account for about 20 percent of the
consumer basket, a 5.3 percent increase in nominal
house prices—corresponding to the nominal house
price growth rate over 2019:Q4–20:Q4—would
translate to a cumulative increase of 1.5 percentage
points in inflation over a period of two years. The
pass-through to overall inflation and the degree of
persistence remain uncertain and depend on how the
factors behind house price increases will evolve: the
ultra-low-for-long interest rate environment, which
has pushed mortgage rates to very low levels; low
housing inventory,7 induced by production shortfalls
and sellers’ hesitancy to put houses on the market;

inflation through the rent component, policymakers

response to rising house prices where necessary: the
impact on affordability and cost of living; potential
resource misallocation and risk of overheating, even
in the absence of visible inflationary pressures; and

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

Box 1.2. Jobs and the Green Economy
Achieving the reductions in greenhouse gas emissions
needed to mitigate global warming will require a transformation of the global economy. This green economic
transformation will likely necessitate a shift of workers
away from carbon-intensive and environmentally
destructive production processes toward jobs that help
reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve environmental sustainability. These “green” or “greener” jobs include
newer occupations using emerging technologies, which
are expected to see increased demand with the greening
of the economy (such as jobs related to solar and wind
power installation and maintenance) as well as existing
occupations with markedly enhanced or changed skill
sets required for a low-carbon economy (such as jobs in
automotive repair, power plants, and mining operations).1
But how prevalent are these jobs in the economy, what
sectors and kinds of workers have them, and what have
been the recent trends in their growth? This box examines
these questions and provides some perspectives on how the
job market could be impacted by the green transition.
A key question for policymakers is how the transition
to a greener economy will affect employment, both in
the aggregate and across sectors and skill levels. A first
step in answering this question is defining what green
jobs are. In this box, green jobs are identified using the
O*NET Resource Center (2021) taxonomy of green
occupations. This taxonomy enables occupations to be
sorted into three categories: (1) new occupations based
on tasks that use emerging technologies to green the
economy; (2) occupations that are expected to undergo
significant changes in the kind and composition of tasks
they do, owing to the greening of the economy; and
(3) other occupations, which do not involve green tasks.
For each occupation, a green-task-intensity measure is
computed as the ratio of green to total tasks, following
Vona and others (2018). For remaining occupations
(in the third category), their green task intensity is set to
zero. Aggregate green-task-intensity indices are computed as employment-weighted averages for the relevant
workforce. At the economy level, this index can be
thought of as proxying the share of tasks undertaken by
The authors of this box are John Bluedorn and Niels-Jakob
Hansen, with support from Savannah Newman.
1See O*NET Resource Center (2021) for details on the
task-based classification of occupations according to the relationship to the greening of the economy. For examples of studies
applying this taxonomy to the United States, see Consoli and
others (2016); Bowen, Kuralbayeva, and Tipoe (2018); and,
particularly, Vona and others (2018).

Managers,” “Hazardous Material Removal Workers,” and “Weatherization Installers and Technicians.” Examples of other jobs with
high shares of green tasks (40–50 percent) include “Automotive
Specialty Technicians,” “Civil Engineers,” and “Plumbers.”

United States and a selected group of European Union
member countries.3 The figure suggests that the share
of green tasks in the average job has increased marginally since 2014, from about 2.2 percent to about
2.4 percent, with some variation across countries. A
growing proportion of workers is employed in greening occupations, caused by employment shifts either
within or between sectors. But the pace of increase is
slow, with no marked evidence for greening of jobs.
The urgency of the climate change threat suggests that
a faster transformation will be needed in the future.
Figure 1.2.2 shows both the average green task
index by sector and the distribution across occupations
within each sector. The two sectors with the largest
share of green tasks are “Water and Waste Management” and “Professional and Scientific Activities.”
However, green tasks are also being performed in other
sectors, including those usually associated with higher
carbon emissions, such as heavy industry. Moreover,
jobs with workers at higher levels of educational
attainment or income tend to involve more green tasks
(Figure 1.2.1, panel 2).
Overall, the evidence presented in this box suggests
that jobs have become greener over the past decade.
In addition, green tasks are being performed across
all sectors—an important nuance about the potential impact of the green transition only evident from
examining employment through the lens of occupations and tasks. Finally, workers with higher educational attainment and higher incomes are more likely
to be in jobs involving greener tasks. In other words,
greener jobs tend to be higher-skill and higher-income
jobs, highlighting the complementarity between
investing in people and boosting the green economic
transition. Lower-skilled workers should receive the
training and support needed to ensure that the green
transition is inclusive.

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

Box 1.3. Monetary Expansions and Inflationary Risks
The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted various central
banks to cut policy rates close to zero and has pushed
fiscal authorities to massive fiscal expansions, leading to
sharp increases in public debt and, in some countries,
casting doubts about debt sustainability. Given the
constraints faced by conventional monetary policy and
fiscal policy, central banks in various countries will likely
remain under pressure to use unconventional policy tools
to support the economic recovery and react to possible
adverse shocks.
Besides using forward guidance and, in a few cases,
resorting to negative interest rates, central banks
in advanced economies have increasingly relied on
refinancing operations and large-scale purchases of
government bonds and even private securities. During
the pandemic, central banks in several emerging
market and developing economies have undertaken
similar, albeit modest, asset purchases, sometimes with
the explicit goal to provide fiscal support.
Asset purchases by central banks are generally
financed through an expansion of the monetary base.
These operations have at times blurred the demarcation between monetary and fiscal policies, raising the
specter of fiscal dominance. The concern is that monetary base expansions may de-anchor inflation expectations and trigger severe price pressures if they are
perceived as responding to fiscal pressures rather than
to macroeconomic stabilization goals. To shed light on
this issue, Agur and others (forthcoming) analyze the
association between increases in the monetary base and
changes in inflation up to 10 years in the future using
a large panel of countries with data going back to the
1950s. The analysis uses local projections that control
for the real growth rate of GDP and lagged values of
money growth and inflation.
The association between money growth and
inflation depends heavily on economic conditions
and institutional factors, especially in the first few
years after the monetary expansion. An expansion
of the monetary base is followed by only a modest
increase in inflation if the initial level of inflation is
low (Figure 1.3.1 panel 1), the central bank operates
under strong independence (Figure 1.3.1, panel 2),
and the fiscal deficit is modest (Figure 1.3.1, panel 3).
On the contrary, a monetary expansion tends to be
followed by sharp increases in inflation if the initial

These results suggest that asset purchases financed

by credible central banks when inflation is below target and the fiscal position is sustainable. Nonetheless,
central banks should remain vigilant about the possible
inflationary effects of recent monetary expansions
because their balance sheets have reached historically high levels in several countries and due to the
concomitant effects of large fiscal stimulus during the

COVID-19 pandemic. Central banks should instead
refrain from asset purchases if they operate under weak
independence and in the context of high inflation
and precarious fiscal positions. In these circumstances,
monetary expansions are much more likely to fuel
sharp price responses, possibly reflecting heightened
risks of fiscal dominance.

Primary commodity prices rose 16.6 percent between

buoyed by a strong recovery in commodity demand,

factor. This special feature also analyzes how the soaring

Market Developments
Oil prices rose 13.9 percent between February
and August 2021 on the rapid economic recovery in
advanced economies. In light of falling global inventories (Figure 1.SF.1, panel 4), OPEC+ (Organization
of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, plus Russia
and other non-OPEC oil exporters) agreed in July to
gradually phase out their remaining 5.8 million barrel
per day production curbs by September 2022.
Futures prices point to backwardation (a downward
sloping curve), with oil prices at $65.7 per barrel in
2021—59 percent higher than the 2020 average—
falling to $56.3 in 2026. Market tightness is expected
to continue—in line with the International Energy
Agency’s (IEA) oil demand recovery projections. Risks
to oil prices are balanced in the near term. Upside
risks include lower global production capacity (because
investment has fallen over the past year) and prolonged
price support by OPEC+. The rise of the Delta variant
of SARS-CoV-2 and higher output from uncommitted
OPEC+ members (Iran, Libya, Venezuela) and US
shale oil producers are the major downside risks to oil
prices in the near term (Figure 1.SF.1, panels 2 and 3).
Natural gas prices spiked globally. Asian liquefied
natural gas prices rose 132.2 percent to $16.6 a million
British thermal units between February and August
2021, spilling over to European and US prices. The
price spike was driven mainly by depleted natural gas
stocks after a harsh winter, coupled with hot summer
weather in the Northern Hemisphere, rebounding
industrial activity, and idiosyncratic factors, such as
low hydropower output in Brazil. High natural gas
prices sustained the power sector’s demand for coal,
although surging coal prices—caused in part by supply
disruptions and China’s restrictions on Australian coal
imports—and higher carbon prices narrowed coal’s

cost advantage. Over the long term, phaseout plans
and rising emission costs may negatively weigh on the
demand outlook for coal, possibly benefiting natural
gas demand in the coming years as the capacity for
renewables ramps up.
The IMF base metal price index rose 9.7 percent
between February and August 2021, while precious
metal prices decreased by 1.8 percent. Base metals
reached a 10-year high in July but have retreated
somewhat since then. Prices were buoyed by the recovery in global manufacturing, improved prospects for
infrastructure investment in advanced economies, and
supply disruptions due to COVID-19. Expectations
of higher metal demand during the energy transition
supported prices for copper, cobalt, and other metals. Loose financial conditions provided additional
price support.
The base metal price index in 2021 is projected to
be 57.7 percent higher than the previous year average and to decrease 1.5 percent in 2022. Risks to the
outlook are balanced, but the rise of the Delta variant
is a major source of uncertainty as the resurgence of
the virus may suppress demand for metals as well
as disrupt supply. The pace of the energy transition
adds uncertainty to the demand for some metals (see
below). Precious metal prices are expected to rise
5.1 percent in 2021 and 0.2 percent in 2022.
Food prices: During the first half of 2021 prices
of many staple crops surged, continuing the trend
noted in the April 2021 World Economic Outlook. The
32

International Monetary Fund | October 2021

IMF’s food and beverage price index rose 11.1 percent
between February and August, peaking in May 2021 at
the highest price in real terms since the 2010–11 world
food price crisis—led by meat (up 30.1 percent), coffee
(29.1 percent), and cereals (5.4 percent).
Continued increases in international food producer
prices pose upside risks to consumer food price inflation (Figure 1.SF.2), especially in emerging markets,
where the pass-through from producer to consumer

pass-through vary according to regional factors, such
as dependence of food imports and the strength of the
local currency against the US dollar.

Clean Energy Transition and Metals:
Blessing or Bottleneck?
To limit global temperature increases from climate change to 1.5 degrees Celsius, countries and
firms increasingly pledge to reduce carbon dioxide
emissions to net zero by 2050. Reaching this goal
requires a transformation of the energy system that
could substantially raise the demand for metals.
Low-greenhouse-gas technologies—including
renewable energy, electric vehicles, hydrogen, and
carbon capture—require more metals than their
fossil-fuel-based counterparts.
If metal demand ramps up and supply is slow to
react, a multiyear price rally may follow—possibly
derailing or delaying the energy transition. To shed
light on the issue, this Special Feature introduces
“energy transition” metals, estimates price elasticity of
supply, and presents price scenarios for major metals.
It also provides estimates for revenues and identifies
which countries may benefit.

Critical Metals for Green Technologies
The metals required for clean energy transition are
quite diverse (Table 1.SF.1). Some, such as copper and
nickel (major established metals), have been traded for
more than a century on metal exchanges. Others, such
as lithium and cobalt (minor but rising metals), are
thinly or not yet traded on metal exchanges but have
gained popularity because they are used in energy transition technologies. In addition, the demand for some
metals would increase with more certainty because
they are used across a range of low-carbon technologies
(copper, nickel, and manganese, for example) while

the use of others, such as cobalt and lithium, is limited
to batteries.
The four representative metals chosen for in-depth
analysis are copper, nickel, cobalt, and lithium. Copper
and nickel are well-established metals. Cobalt and lithium are probably the most promising rising metals.
In the IEA’s Net Zero by 2050 emissions scenario,
total consumption of lithium and cobalt rises by a factor of more than six, driven by clean energy demand,
while copper shows a twofold and nickel a fourfold
increase in total consumption (see Figure 1.SF.3).1 The
scenario also implies that the growth in metal demand
would initially be very high between now and 2030
and slow down over time because the switch from fossil fuels to renewables requires large initial investments
(Figure 1.SF.4). The increase in demand for metals is
more modest in the IEA’s Stated Policies Scenario.

Other countries that stand out in production and
reserves include Australia (for lithium, cobalt, and
nickel); Chile (for copper and lithium); and, to lesser
extent, Peru, Russia, Indonesia, and South Africa.
The economic benefits of higher prices for metal
exporters could be substantial. Econometric analysis
identifies the impact of price shocks, exploiting the
different responses of GDP and government balances

Where Will Energy Transition Metals Be Produced?
Who Will Benefit?

The supply of metals is quite concentrated, implying
that a few top producers may stand to benefit. In most
cases, countries that have the largest production have the
highest level of reserves and, thus, are likely prospective
producers. The Democratic Republic of the Congo,
for example, accounts for about 70 percent of global
cobalt output and 50 percent of reserves (Figure 1.SF.5).

1The

IEA’s Net Zero by 2050 scenario assumes that policies and
behavioral changes bring carbon emissions to net zero by 2050. The
IEA’s Stated Policies Scenario assumes a more gradual energy transition, resulting in insufficient action on climate change (IEA 2021).

Metal Prices and Supply Elasticities in a Net Zero by

Supply elasticities summarize how fast firms raise
output in reaction to a price increase. In the short
term, supply grows thanks to more recycling and
higher utilization rates of mining capacity. In the long
term, firms build new mines, innovate in extraction

Based on historical data and the estimated supply
elasticities, the algorithm by Antolin-Diaz, Petrella, and
Rubio-Ramirez (2021) pins down a series of exogenouslyand demand-driven price shocks that incentivize the production path needed for the energy transition in the IEA
scenarios (see Online Annex 1.SF.1, available at www​.
imf​.org/​en/​Publications/​WEO). A price path implied by
these shocks is then derived. Compared with conditional
forecasts, this methodology can distinguish between
demand and supply shocks driving the price.
Results show that prices would reach historical
peaks for an unprecedented, sustained period under
the Net Zero by 2050 emissions scenario. The prices
of cobalt, lithium, and nickel would rise several
hundred percent from 2020 levels and could delay
the energy transition (Figure 1.SF.8). In contrast,
copper is less in danger of a bottleneck as it faces

Note: Supply elasticities are the ratio of the change in price and output from horizon

bounds are the 16th and 84th percentiles, respectively. See Online Annex 1.SF.1
for methodology.

technologies, and conduct exploration.3 To estimate
the elasticity at different horizons, data are used for
global economic activity, output, and real prices from
1879 to 2020, where available.
Results show that supply is quite inelastic over
the short term but more elastic over the long term
(Figure 1.SF.7). A demand-induced positive price
shock of 10 percent increases the same-year output
of copper by 3.5 percent, nickel 7.1 percent, cobalt
3.2 percent, and lithium 16.9 percent. After 20 years,
the same price shock raises the output of copper by
7.5 percent, nickel 13.0 percent, cobalt 8.6 percent,
and lithium 25.5 percent.
The elasticities correspond to the four metals’ different production methods. Copper, nickel, and cobalt are
extracted in mines, which often require capital-intensive
investment and take as long as 19 years to construct. In
contrast, lithium is often extracted from mineral springs
and brine as salty water is pumped from the earth. As
such, lead times to open new production facilities—up
to seven years—are shorter. Innovation in extraction
technology, market concentration, and regulations also
influence supply elasticities.
3Geological reserves are not fixed but dynamic. Firms can increase
their reserves by investing in exploration and extraction technologies.
The amount of metals in the Earth’s crust is quite abundant compared to human extraction in any time frame relevant for economic
considerations (see Schwerhoff and Stuermer 2020).

less steep demand increases. Estimated prices reach
a peak, roughly such as the one in 2011, although
for a longer period. Prices for all four metals would
broadly stay in the current range in the Stated Policies
Scenario. Results are subject to high uncertainty,
reflected in the large bounds.
Prices peak mostly around 2030 for two reasons:
first, the steep rises in demand are frontloaded in
the Net Zero by 2050 emissions scenario. Unlike
fossil-fuel-based energy production, renewable energy
production uses metals up front; for example, to build
wind turbines or batteries. Second, the price boom
induces a supply reaction, reducing market tightness after 2030.

Revenue and Policy Implications
In the Net Zero by 2050 emissions scenario, the
demand boom would lead to a sixfold increase in the
value of metal production—totaling $12.9 trillion over
the next two decades for the four energy transition
metals alone, providing significant windfalls to producers. This would rival the potential value of global oil
production in that scenario (see Table 1.SF.2).
High uncertainty surrounds the demand scenarios.
First, technological change is hard to predict. Second,
the speed and direction of the energy transition
depend on policy decisions.
High policy uncertainty, in turn, may hinder
mining investment and increase the chances that high
metal prices will derail or delay the energy transition.

36

International Monetary Fund | October 2021

A credible, globally coordinated climate policy; high
environmental, social, labor, and governance standards;
and reduced trade barriers and export restrictions
would allow markets to operate efficiently, directing
investment to sufficiently expand metal supply—
thus avoiding unnecessarily increasing the cost of
low-carbon technologies and supporting the clean
energy transition.
Finally, a new international institution focused
on metals—analogous to the IEA for energy and the
Food and Agricultural Organization for agricultural
goods—could play a pivotal role in data dissemination
and analysis, industry standards, and international
cooperation.

INFLATION SCARES

Since the beginning of 2021, headline consumer price
index (CPI) inflation has increased in advanced and
emerging market economies, driven by firming demand,
input shortages, and rapidly rising commodity prices.
Despite large uncertainty about the measurement of output gaps around the pandemic, a significant relationship
remains between economic slack and inflation. Long-term
inflation expectations have stayed relatively anchored
so far, with little evidence that recent exceptional policy
measures have de-anchored those expectations. Looking
ahead, headline inflation is projected to peak in the
final months of 2021, with inflation expected back to
pre-pandemic levels by mid-2022 for both advanced economies and emerging markets country groups, and with
risks tilted to the upside. Long-term inflation expectations
are projected to remain anchored in the baseline forecast. Given the recovery’s uncharted nature, considerable
uncertainty remains, particularly relating to the assessment
of economic slack. Prolonged supply disruptions, commodity and housing price shocks, longer-term expenditure
commitments, and a de-anchoring of inflation expectations could lead to significantly higher inflation than
predicted in the baseline. Clear communication, combined
with appropriate monetary and fiscal policies tailored to
country-specific contexts, however, could prevent “inflation scares” from unhinging inflation expectations.

Introduction
Headline inflation has risen rapidly in advanced
economies and emerging market and developing economies since the beginning of 2021, though it has been
relatively stable in low-income countries (Figure 2.1).
While core inflation—the change in the prices of
goods and services excluding food and energy—has
risen less than headline rates, it has also ticked up in

Wingender, with contributions from Chunya Bu and support from

recent months. These developments have occurred
amid still-substantial policy support as economies
recover from the deep contraction of 2020. Moreover,
as economies reopen, the release of excess savings
accumulated during the pandemic could further fuel
private spending. This combination of unprecedented
factors has led to concern about the possibility of persistently high inflation.
From a macroeconomic perspective, a sustained
rise in inflation in advanced economies leading to an
unanticipated withdrawal of monetary accommodation
could disrupt financial markets. Emerging market and
developing economies would be especially affected
from the resulting spillover effects through capital outflows and exchange rate depreciations, as seen during
the taper tantrum episode in 2013. High inflation
would also tend to hurt those who rely primarily on
labor income (generally lower-income individuals)
but could also benefit debtors while hurting lenders.
Inflation can, therefore, have complex distributional
consequences.
This chapter assesses the outlook for inflation and
evaluates the risks around it. It first takes stock of inflation trends during the pandemic and then examines
the drivers of inflation using the Phillips curve, which
relates inflation to domestic slack—a key framework
central banks use to form their views on inflation and,
in turn, on monetary policy. It also examines whether
there has been a change in the overall relationship
between economic slack and inflation with inclusion of the pandemic period. This could have major
implications for evaluating the effect of accelerating
demand during the recovery and for the conduct of
monetary policy (see, for example, Draghi 2017 and
Powell 2018).
Inflation expectations and supply shocks are also
crucial to understanding the inflation process. A key
concern is identifying the conditions that could cause
recent inflation spikes to persist, leading to unanchored
expectations and self-fulfilling inflation spirals. Policymakers worry that the unprecedented policy support
enacted in response to the COVID-19 crisis may have
reduced the room for monetary policy to maneuver,

thereby impacting the credibility of central banks and
leading to possible de-anchoring of inflation expectations. This chapter examines how robust the anchor
was during the pandemic and assesses the potential
risk of de-anchoring during the recovery phase. Finally,
the analysis zooms in on sectoral and commodity price
movements, asking how supply shocks could contribute to the inflation outlook.
The key findings of the chapter suggest the
following:
Inflation is expected to revert to pre-pandemic levels by
mid-2022. The analysis indicates that headline inflation
and medium-term inflation expectations are projected
to revert to pre-pandemic levels by mid-2022. Although
much uncertainty remains, particularly regarding
measurement of output gaps, recovering demand is
expected to have only a small impact on future inflation. The IMF staff’s baseline forecasts suggest that,
for the advanced economy country group, on average,
headline inflation will peak in the final months of 2021
and will decline to about 2 percent by mid-2022. Risks
remain tilted slightly to the upside over the medium
term. The outlook for emerging market and developing
economies similarly shows headline inflation declining
to about 4 percent after a peak of 6.8 percent later this
year, with risks tilted to the upside over the medium
term. A key feature of the outlook is the significant
46

cross-country heterogeneity across advanced and
emerging market and developing economies—and even
within advanced economies. While the United States
drives the strong inflation dynamics in advanced economies in the short term, with near-term risks tilted to
the upside, underlying inflation dynamics in the euro
area and Japan remain weak.
Risks: Inflation expectations have stayed relatively
anchored so far, and risks of de-anchoring appear
limited for advanced economies despite frequent
monetary and fiscal policy announcements during the
pandemic. The density forecast in the baseline also
indicates anchored inflation expectations in emerging
market and developing economies over the next two
years. However, considerable uncertainty surrounds
these forecasts, particularly related to the assessment
of economic slack and reflected in the distribution
around the baseline and in the counterfactual scenarios. Sharply rising housing prices and prolonged
input supply shortages in both advanced economies
and emerging market and developing economies and
continued food price pressures and currency depreciations in the latter group could keep inflation elevated
for longer. Simulations of a tail risk scenario with
continued sectoral disruptions and large swings in
commodity prices show that headline inflation could
rise significantly higher than the baseline. Simulations including a temporary de-anchoring of inflation
expectations lead to even higher, more persistent, and
volatile inflation.
Policy implications: Selected case studies complement the statistical analysis and confirm that persistent
“inflation scares” could lead to higher inflation expectations. While strong, sustained policy action was often
needed to bring down inflation and inflation expectations in the past, these actions were accompanied
by—and helped reinforce the credibility of—sound
and clear communication. Importantly, longer-term
expenditure commitments could be associated with
unhinged expectations and underscore the importance
of credible medium-term fiscal frameworks in keeping
expectations anchored (see Chapter 2 of the October
2021 Fiscal Monitor). It is important that policymakers
be on the lookout and be prepared to act, especially
if some of the risks highlighted in this chapter should
materialize at the same time—prolonged supply
disruptions, rising commodity and housing prices,
permanent and unfunded fiscal commitments, a
de-anchoring of expectations, combined with mismeasurement of output gaps.

CHAPTER 2

The rest of the chapter starts with an overview of
recent inflation developments before assessing the
implications of recovering demand on the inflation
outlook through the lens of a Phillips curve. It then
explores the conditions under which inflation spikes
have tended to persist and inflation expectations to
become de-anchored in the past. Next, the chapter
examines the implications of the recent sectoral price
shocks for overall inflation and inflation expectations.
The chapter concludes with a discussion of the analysis’s main policy implications.

Inflation Dynamics: Recent Drivers
The framework employed here sheds light on
three broad drivers of increases in headline inflation:
(1) a pickup in economic activity or closing output
gaps supported by accommodative fiscal and monetary
policies, along with the release of pent-up demand
and accumulated savings (Figure 2.2, panel 1);
(2) rapidly rising commodity prices (Figure 2.2,
panel 2); and (3) input shortages and supply chain
disruptions (Figure 2.2, panel 3). Some have suggested
that the fiscal expansion—unprecedented as it was,
especially in advanced economies—may push unemployment low enough to cause overheating, possibly
de-anchoring inflation expectations and resulting
in a self-fulfilling inflation spiral (Blanchard 2021;
Summers 2021). Others see a persistent surge in price
pressures from a “one-time surge in spending” as
unlikely (Powell 2021).

An Uncertain Outlook
The contrasting views on inflation prospects point to
the high uncertainty surrounding the outlook for price
movements. Factors behind the uncertain inflation
outlook—not necessarily covered explicitly in this
chapter—include the evolution of housing (see Box 1.1
in Chapter 1), structural transformation in labor
markets, and food prices. Global food prices are up by
about 40 percent since the start of the pandemic. This
has implications especially for low-income countries,
where the share of food in consumption baskets is high
(see Box 2.1).
Another source of uncertainty is wage processes
coming out of the pandemic, with accelerating labor
demand hitting up against likely temporary shortages,
leading to worries about fueling a wage-price spiral.

of higher wage growth are apparent in sectors that were
hurt the most by the COVID-19 shock early on—for
instance, there have been notable upticks in wages for
jobs in leisure and hospitality and retail, among other
sectors, in the United States. Evidence from a sample
of 23 advanced economies also suggests that the
average compensation per hour went up significantly
in 2020. However, this wage growth happened at the
same time as a decline in hours (Figure 2.3), and the
brunt of the reduction was disproportionately borne by
low-skilled workers and youth, who tend to earn less.
Despite sectoral wage pressures, and a slight uptick in
economy-wide nominal wage inflation in the United
States, few signs of acceleration in economies are
visible where data are available through the middle of
the year (Canada, Germany, Spain, United Kingdom).
Even after adjusting for composition effects, overall
wage growth has remained within normal ranges,
according to the Federal Reserve of Atlanta’s US Wage
Growth Tracker. As health metrics improve and exceptional income support measures expire, hiring difficulties in certain sectors could abate. That said, substantial
uncertainty remains—and depends on whether firms
can hold off filling the vacancies, their views on how
long current worker shortages will persist, and how
workers’ health-risk-adjusted reservation wages evolve
(see Chapter 1).
48

To take into account exceptionally large changes
in prices of items other than food and energy—such
as tourism and travel—during this crisis, alternative
measures (such as trimmed means or medians that
filter out these unusual movements) point to a more
muted increase in underlying inflation (see Box 2.2).
While some of the current price pressures could
indeed be transitory (for example, because of droughts,
export restrictions, and stockpiling of food stocks),
much uncertainty remains regarding the evolution of
several factors.

International Monetary Fund | October 2021

A key element of central banks’ policy frameworks
is the Phillips curve relationship. This describes a
trade-off between low slack (for instance, low cyclical
unemployment) and high inflation.1 In the Phillips
curve, the inflation process is also related to cost-push
shocks driven by supply disturbances and to long-term
inflation expectations. As inflation-targeting regimes
have become more prevalent, long-term inflation
expectations have played a greater role in explaining
inflation outcomes.2
This section focuses on evaluating the strength
of the relationship between inflation and economic
slack to assess the extent to which expanding demand
could contribute to inflation in the period ahead. A
Phillips curve that includes forward-looking inflation
expectations, lagged inflation, foreign price pressures, and output gaps is estimated on a large sample
of advanced economies and emerging markets for
2000–20. Figure 2.4 reports the estimates for the
pooled sample and the group of advanced economies
1Monetary policymakers typically use the “New Keynesian” framework comprising (1) an aggregate demand relationship, (2) optimal
monetary policy, and (3) a Phillips curve relationship (see Clarida,
Galí, and Gertler 1999). Alternative approaches to understanding the
inflation process consider monetary aggregates as potential predictors
of inflation (see, for instance, Pradhan and Goodhart 2021 for a
review). In the context of the current crisis, Agur and others (2021)
documents that large increases in the money supply because of major
fiscal and monetary stimulus have led to only modest short-term
pass-through from money growth to inflation, especially in countries
with credible central banks.
2Major central banks, such as the European Central Bank and
the US Federal Reserve, have recently adjusted their frameworks
to guide long-term inflation expectations and mitigate deflationary
risks, among other objectives. Thus far, the evolution of inflation
expectations is consistent with the intended objectives of the frameworks’ adjustment.

and emerging markets separately (see Online Annex 2.2
for details of the sample composition and estimation).3
A 1-percentage-point widening of the unemployment
gap—that is, unemployment higher than the natural
rate of unemployment—is associated with a decline in
core inflation of 0.22 percentage point, on average. A
similar point estimate is seen for advanced economies
when splitting the sample by income groups. The coefficient for emerging markets is broadly similar, but not
statistically distinguishable from zero.
The COVID-19 period, however, poses many
challenges to estimating this relationship. There is
much uncertainty about unemployment and output
gaps during the pandemic (see Chapter 1). A massive,
unprecedented fiscal and monetary policy response to
the economic shock may also obscure the relationship
between slack and inflation to a greater extent than
would be seen over the course of a typical business
cycle. Moreover, supply chain disruptions, sectoral
dislocation associated with the pandemic, commodity
price volatility, changing weights in consumer baskets
(Cavallo 2020; Reinsdorf 2020), and extreme base
effects also contribute to measurement challenges
beyond those related to potential output.

INFLATION SCARES

Comparison with the Phillips curve relationship
prior to the pandemic can shed light on the extent
to which the unusually sharp fall and rebound in
effective potential output induced by lockdown and
reopening in 2020 might have affected the estimates.
Figure 2.4 reports the response of core inflation to the
changes in the unemployment gap estimated up to
the fourth quarter of 2019 for advanced economies.
The unprecedented pandemic disturbances do not
seem to have altered the Phillips curve relationship for
advanced economies. Estimates for emerging markets
instead seem to be more sensitive to the inclusion of
the pandemic period.4 The results also point to mixed
evidence on nonlinear effects at different levels of slack
(see Online Annex 2.2).

A Causal Phillips Curve Confirms the Relevance of the
Inflation-Activity Trade-Off
Although these results are based on a model that
includes country-specific indicators and several
controls, they could still be confounded by omitted
variables and reverse causality. A widening output gap
and weakening of inflation, for example, could induce
central banks to reduce interest rates to boost demand,
and so blunt what might have otherwise shown up
as pronounced movement in the data (for a detailed
discussion of the endogeneity issues in this setting, see
McLeay and Tenreyro 2020). To address such concerns,
an alternative estimation based on a treatment effect
methodology is performed.5 As proposed by Barnichon
and Mesters (2021), well-identified demand shocks can
be used to instrument for changes in unemployment.
In particular, monetary policy shocks are used to proxy
for demand shocks, to recover a causal relationship
between inflation and activity. Causal estimates of
the Phillips coefficient can be recovered by taking the
4The larger magnitude of the estimated coefficient for emerging markets in the pre-COVID-19 sample could be driven by different policies
and shocks and could point to measurement errors too, especially in
measuring slack, attenuating the estimates in the 2000–20 sample
toward zero.
5This involves estimating central banks’ monetary policy reaction
functions and using inverse probability weighting to identify the
impact of unexpected changes in short-term rates. The methodology
proposed by Angrist, Jordà, and Kuersteiner (2018) is extended here
to a panel setting. Recent macroeconomic studies that use this methodology to achieve identification include Jordà and Taylor (2016),
Serrato and Wingender (2016), Acemoglu and others (2019), and
Caselli and Wingender (2021). Willems (2020) instead constructs
a measure of monetary policy tightening based on large and unexpected interest rate hikes for 162 countries.

ratio of these impulse response functions of inflation
to unemployment at the relevant horizon.6 A negative
and statistically significant slope coefficient of minus
0.22 is estimated for advanced economies, providing
reassurance of the validity of the reduced form results.
These findings provide further evidence of strength in
the relationship between inflation and slack.7

What role will the closing of output gaps play in

The previous causal relationship is used to back out the
contribution of the projected closing of the unemployment gap in advanced economies on inflation
dynamics for the next six years.8 This year and the
next exhibit a moderately positive inflation impulse
of about 0.23 percentage point and 0.14 percentage
point, respectively (Figure 2.5). This impact softens
in 2023 and 2024 before turning into a negligible
disinflation impulse in 2026. These aggregate figures

Annex 2.2 presents the details of the impulse responses
of inflation and unemployment to contractionary monetary policy
surprises and discusses their dynamics. Online Annex Figure 2.2.2,
panel 1, shows that the unemployment rate increases by 1 percentage
point, on average, in response to a cumulative 40-basis-point surprise
tightening, compared with a neutral stance, and the full impact
takes about 12 quarters to materialize. Online Annex Figure 2.2.2,
panel 2, shows that core inflation significantly decreases by about
0.2 percentage point after 15 quarters to the same sequence of
monetary policy tightening. While the estimated impulse response
function for the unemployment rate is at the higher end, it is consistent with the empirical literature that exploits narrative approaches
to estimate the effects of monetary policy shocks on real activity
(Ramey 2016). Moreover, it is important to stress the differences in
terms of sample period and composition and estimation approach
compared with the bulk of the literature, which focuses on linear
models in the United States. See Online Annex 2.2 for a more
detailed discussion.
7Results are reported for advanced economies only. Data limitations and variability in policy reaction functions for emerging market
central banks result in a weak first stage for these countries.
8The literature points to mixed evidence about the strength of the
Phillips curve. Several explanations have been offered for a potential
flattening of the Phillips curve. For instance, since the mid-1990s
inflation expectations have become increasingly more important
in explaining current inflation (Chapter 3 of the April 2013 World
Economic Outlook [WEO]; Yellen 2015). Second, globalization forces
have been mentioned as potential drivers of a weakening relationship
between inflation and domestic slack (Borio and Filardo 2007; Auer,
Borio, and Filardo 2017; Chapter 3 of the October 2018 WEO;
Bems and others, forthcoming). Third, other long-term structural
changes, such as workers’ declining bargaining power and automation, greater employer concentration, and higher wage rigidity
reduced the sensitivity of inflation to the level of slack (Yellen 2012;
Daly, Hobijn, and Pyle 2016; Hooper, Mishkin, and Sufi 2019).

mask a significant degree of heterogeneity, as shown
by the interquartile ranges, with the United States and
its extraordinary policy support driving short-term
inflation dynamics. Results for emerging markets
using reduced-form estimates show a stronger impulse
toward inflation as a result of recovering labor markets
equal to 0.5 percentage point in 2021, but moderate
contributions through the forecast horizon (see Online
Annex 2.2).9 These calculations crucially rely on the
projected unemployment paths and estimates of the
potential scarring from the crisis (see Chapter 1).
Given the recovery’s uncharted nature, considerable
uncertainty around these economic-slack-induced
dynamics remains because of the difficulties in quantifying the extent of potential scarring and the effects of
the crisis on potential output.

The Role of Anchoring of Inflation Expectations
The previous section presented evidence that
expanding demand is likely to have a muted impact on
future inflation. Nevertheless, other factors, such as the
9The calculation for emerging markets is presented in Online
Annex Figure 2.2.3, and is based on ordinary least squares
coefficients.

CHAPTER 2

10These include (1) the variability of long-term inflation forecasts
over time—if expectations are anchored, revisions to long-term
forecasts should be small, and thus the average forecast relatively
stable over time; (2) the dispersion of expectations across agents;
(3) the sensitivity of long-term expectations to expectations about
short-term inflation or macroeconomic surprises; and (4) the
deviation of medium- or longer-term inflation expectations from the
central bank’s target. For details on the construction of the index, see
Bems and others (2021). The index is constructed using professional
forecasters’ long-term (three-year and longer) inflation expectations.

Figure 2.6. Inﬂation Anchoring

Anchoring has improved, particularly in emerging market economies, but it still
varies across countries. Sound and suitable monetary and ﬁscal policies are
associated with more anchored expectations.

anchoring of inflation expectations and supply shocks,
are also crucial to understanding the inflation process.
A key question is the conditions under which recent
inflation spikes could persist, including because expectations become unanchored and lead to self-fulfilling
inflation spirals. This section explores the conditions
under which expectations can become unanchored. It
then examines what countries have done in the past to
successfully keep expectations anchored or bring them
down once they rose.
Anchoring: The literature proposes various indicators to measure the degree of anchoring. Chapter 3
of the October 2018 WEO and Bems and others
(2021) construct a synthetic indicator that includes
four subcomponents capturing either operational or
practical characteristics associated with stable and
anchored inflation expectations.10 Inflation expectations are considered anchored if they are stable over
time, exhibit little cross-sectional dispersion, are insensitive to macroeconomic news, and are close to the
central bank target. As shown in Figure 2.6, panel 1,
although advanced economies presented a relatively
stable degree of anchoring during the past two decades,
consistent with early adoption of inflation-targeting
regimes, emerging markets have seen significant
improvements since the beginning of the 2000s. These
economies have achieved anchoring comparable to that
of advanced economies in recent years. Nevertheless,
among emerging market economies, significant variability remains—as shown by the wider interquartile
range in Figure 2.6, panel 1.
Institutional characteristics and anchoring of inflation
expectations: The extent of anchoring is closely associated with institutional characteristics, such as the
credibility of monetary and fiscal policy as well as the
general macroeconomic situation and structural characteristics. In this regard, an independent and transparent
central bank and sound and sustainable ﬁscal policy are
key prerequisites for credible policies (Mishkin 2000;
Mishkin and Savastano 2001). The cross-country variation in the degree of anchoring is positively correlated

economic activity could present the central bank
with a policy dilemma. Although loose monetary
policies might be appropriate to boost demand, they
could accelerate price pressure and increase uncertainty, which would hold back private investment and
employment growth. By contrast, if inflation expectations are anchored, the central bank has more scope to
pursue the appropriate countercyclical policy response
to stimulate demand (Chapter 3 of the October 2018
WEO; Bems and others 2020).

When Have Expectations Become Unanchored
in the Past?
Analysis of past inflation episodes can help shed
light on conditions that contribute to de-anchoring of
inflation expectations. The exercise identifies turning points in inflation—“inflation accelerations or
scares”—following the approach used in Hausmann,
Pritchett, and Rodrik (2005) (for growth performance). Fifty-five episodes distributed equally across
advanced economies and emerging markets are identified (Figure 2.7).
Inflation accelerations are associated with sharp
exchange rate depreciations in emerging markets.
On average, the nominal effective exchange rate depreciated by about 8 percent in the quarter the episode
began.11 Inflation accelerations were also preceded by an
upsurge in fiscal and current account deficits in emerging markets. Unlike the full sample or emerging market
and developing economy estimates, fiscal balances in
advanced economies rose prior to high inflation episodes,
on average, which suggests that aggregate demand shocks
could have driven both fiscal performance and inflation
in advanced economies. Short- and medium-term inflation expectations rose sharply too during inflation scares.
More persistent episodes, defined as those during which
inflation remained elevated for six quarters or more, were
associated with a steeper rise in three-year-ahead inflation
expectations (see Online Annex 2.3).
Given the difficulty of quantifying some important policy variables, such as communication from
the central bank, this section also applies a narrative
approach to selected case studies (Box 2.3). An analysis of macroeconomic outcomes in the case studies
confirms many of the findings of the statistical analysis
and offers additional insights. Longer-term expenditure

statistically significant.

commitments (for example, financing the Vietnam
War and Great Society programs in the 1960s in the
United States, and soaring subsidy bills and agricultural debt waivers in India in the late 2000s) could
be associated with unhinged expectations.12 External
shocks combined with sharp exchange rate depreciations (for example, in Brazil in the early 2000s) could
also trigger a de-anchoring of expectations, especially
in countries starting from an environment of low monetary policy credibility. Moreover, even when expectations are well anchored, a prolonged deviation of
inflation from target could cause expectations to move
(such as in Chile before the global financial crisis).

Expectations Anchoring during the COVID-19 Pandemic
How robust has the inflation anchor been during
the COVID-19 pandemic? If inflation expectations are well anchored, they should not respond
to inflation surprises. To zoom in on the pandemic
12Coibion, Gorodnichenko, and Weber (2021) finds that US
households anticipate higher short-term and long-term inflation following news about future debt but do not in response to
information about current debt, suggesting that households are able
to distinguish between transitory fiscal changes and those that are
more permanent.

CHAPTER 2

period, a daily market-based measure of long-term
inflation expectations, the five-year, five-year forward
breakeven inflation rate, is analyzed for a sample of
14 countries.13 Inflation surprises are proxied by oil
price shocks, measured as the change in the price of
one-year-ahead oil futures contracts. Consistent with
the previous literature (Gürkaynak, Sack, and Wright
2010; Beechey, Johannsen, and Levin 2011; Celasun,
Mihet, and Ratnovski 2012), the results indicate a small
but significant effect of oil price shocks on expectations
(Figure 2.8, panel 1). The introduction of an interaction
term of oil futures prices with an indicator for the pandemic period (starting in March 2020) reveals that, on
average, in the limited sample, there was no significant
change in the relationship between oil price surprises
and the breakeven rate during the pandemic compared
with normal times (Figure 2.8, panel 2). Breakeven
inflation rates in the United States, however, overshot
their pre-pandemic levels in January 2021.14 An analysis
of daily monetary and fiscal policy announcements
reveals no evidence of de-anchoring in response to the
exceptionally large policy responses to the pandemic
(see Online Annex Figure 2.3.2). Overall, these findings
suggest that the anchor has remained relatively stable so
far during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis.

Sectoral Shocks and the Inflation Outlook
The COVID-19 crisis triggered large price movements in some sectors, notably transportation, food,
clothing, and communications (see Online Annex 2.4).
However, overall sectoral price dispersion so far
has remained relatively subdued by recent historical standards, especially compared with the global
13See Online Annex 2.3 for country coverage, variable definitions, and estimation details. In addition to reflecting expectations
about future inflation, breakeven rates include both liquidity risk
premiums and inflation risk premiums, reflecting uncertainty about
future inflation, which could have important policy implications
(Chapter 1 of the October 2021 Global Financial Stability Report).
Countries for which breakeven inflation rates are available are mostly
advanced economies or major emerging markets with high central
bank credibility and well-anchored inflation expectations. Robustness exercises with liquidity-adjusted measures are implemented
following Gürkaynak, Sack, and Wright (2010). The time-varying
effect of liquidity on inflation compensation is measured as the fitted
values from a regression of the breakeven rate on liquidity proxies
for both bonds.
14Consistent with the shift to the flexible average inflation-­
targeting framework, breakeven inflation rates in the United States
rose, particularly at shorter horizons, primarily due to an increase in
the risk-adjusted expected inflation component (Chapter 1 of the
October 2021 Global Financial Stability Report).

Figure 2.9, panel 2, this is driven by somewhat smaller
and shorter-lived swings in fuel (transport), food, and
housing prices, which are the three largest components
of consumption baskets, on average.
In addition, a case study of the semiconductor
industry in the United States points to only a modest
increase in overall inflation, given a potential doubling of semiconductor input prices (see Online
Annex Figure 2.4.2). This is because categories with
the highest potential increase in inflation, as a result
of the doubling input price of semiconductors, have a
very small weight in personal consumption expenditures (such as personal computers and photographic
equipment).15 An important caveat though is, while
15In contrast, consumption items with the highest weights in
the consumption basket (for example, housing) exhibit negligible
price increases from higher semiconductor input prices. The analysis
makes use of US input-output tables.

it is possible that the shortage in semiconductor
chips may not directly translate into higher prices, it
could still lead to lower output of products that rely
on chips as inputs, for instance cars, which in turn
could lead to higher prices for these goods or their
substitutes.

The Inflation Outlook
To assess how sectoral price dynamics could affect the
inflation outlook, a structural quantile vector autoregression model is estimated for advanced economies and
emerging market and developing economies to gauge
the balance of risks by looking at broader moments
of the density forecast (Koenker and Xiao 2006;
Ghysels, Iania, and Striaukas 2018; Montes-Rojas 2019;
Chavleishvili and Manganelli 2020; Boire, Duprey, and
54

International Monetary Fund | October 2021

Ueberfeldt 2021).16 Online Annex 2.4 provides details
and definitions of the variables.
Density forecasts show a sharp rise in inflation in
the near term. Headline inflation among advanced
economies is expected to peak at 3.6 percent in the
final months of 2021 (Figure 2.10, panel 1). The
forecast then drops to 3.2 percent by the end of the
year and reaches about 2 percent by mid-2022. Risks
are tilted slightly to the upside over the medium term
for advanced economies. These findings also suggest
a 10 percent probability of inflation remaining above
3.4 percent through the end of 2021. While the
density forecasts suggest that inflation is likely to peak
later this year in advanced economies, uncertainty
remains related to the factors mentioned earlier.
The outlook for emerging market and developing
economies indicates a return to trend headline inflation
of about 4 percent by mid-2022 (Figure 2.10, panel
3). Risks remain tilted to the upside over the medium
term for emerging markets, as evidenced by the wider
interquartile range at the top of the density forecast
than at the bottom.17
Inflation expectations: Long-term inflation expectations present a relatively strong degree of anchoring.
They gradually trend back to about 2 percent, on average, in the baseline forecast for advanced economies,
with little risk of de-anchoring (Figure 2.10, panel 2).
For emerging market and developing economies,
expectations are projected to remain anchored over the
medium term, but with upside risks, as shown by the
mean forecast lying above the median forecast starting
in mid-2023 (Figure 2.10, panel 4).
Assessing the Impact of Continued Strong Increases
in Commodity Prices and Sectoral Price Dispersion
The previous results are based on the historical
relationship between inflation dynamics and its determinants, including the reaction function of central
banks to incoming data. Given the uniqueness of the
current episode, any attempt to extrapolate lessons
from experience into the future must be approached
with caution. In particular, policymakers wonder about
the effect of continued and sustained sectoral disruptions on the inflation outlook. Could sectoral price
volatility, for example from housing or food prices,
16Following Lenza and Primiceri (2020), the estimation of parameters of the model excludes the pandemic period.
17Reversion to trend may be delayed if monetary policy does not
respond as quickly to higher inflation as it has in the past.

emerging markets by early 2022 (Figure 2.11, panels 1

become adaptive for a period of 12 months, meaning
expectations are no longer forward-looking but rather
react to incoming data.18 In Figure 2.12, inflation
increases substantially in this extreme scenario and
becomes more persistent and volatile, as indicated by
the much wider interquartile ranges—pointing to the
serious implications of inflation expectations becoming

Conclusions

21

Rising commodity prices and supply chain bottlenecks are putting upward pressure on headline inflation rates. Moreover, the unprecedented nature of the
current recovery has raised questions about how long
supply will take to catch up with accelerating demand.
These uncertainties are fueling worries that inflation
could persistently overshoot central bank targets and
de-anchor expectations, leading to a self-fulfilling
inflation spiral.
The analysis in this chapter suggests that likely will
not be the case. Although the overall findings imply
an increase in headline inflation in both advanced
and emerging markets, it is expected to subside to
pre-pandemic ranges by mid-2022 in the baseline.
However, this assessment is subject to significant
uncertainty, given the uncharted nature of the recovery.
Simulations of scenarios characterized by strong rises
in commodity prices, continued sectoral shocks, and
adaptive expectations suggest significant risks to the
inflation outlook. More persistent supply disruptions
and sharply rising housing prices in both advanced
economies and emerging market and developing
economies, or currency depreciations and food price

points to fairly strong anchoring of about 2 percent in
advanced economies, with little risk of de-anchoring
(Figure 2.11, panel 2). For emerging market and developing economies, there is overshooting of expectations
in the short term (Figure 2.11, panel 4). However,
inflation expectations are projected to remain anchored
over the medium term.
In summary, sectoral disruptions and large swings in
commodity prices could mean upside risks for headline inflation, with higher peaks and a delayed return
to trend inflation. The medium-term outlook, nevertheless, would likely still be driven by fundamentals,
including the speed of the recovery and the continued
anchoring of inflation expectations.

CHAPTER 2

pressure in the latter group emerging market and
developing economies, could all lead inflation to
remain elevated for longer than currently expected.
In terms of policy implications, there are four
key lessons.
First, the narrative account of selected case studies
and scenario analyses suggest that when expectations
become de-anchored, inflation can quickly take off and
be costly to rein back in. Ultimately, policy credibility
and setting of inflation expectations are an endogenous, and possibly nonlinear, process that is hard to
pin down precisely; moreover, any assessment of inflation anchoring cannot be decided entirely on the basis
of relationships observed in historical data. Policymakers therefore must be ready to act and, more importantly, ensure that sound monetary frameworks are in
place, including triggers that could require action. Such
triggers could comprise early signs of de-anchoring
inflation expectations—from forward-looking surveys, unsustainable fiscal and current accounts, or
sharp movements in the exchange rate. In particular,
policymakers must be alert to triggers for a perfect
storm of inflation risks that could be relatively benign
when considered individually but that, by materializing
together, could lead to significantly higher inflation
than predicted in the baseline forecasts.
Second, case studies demonstrate that, while strong
policy action was often successful in bringing down
inflation and inflation expectations, sound and credible
communication also played a crucial role in keeping expectations anchored. In this context, clear and
state-contingent forward guidance and communication
(with well-articulated triggers for action) from advanced
economy central banks are key during periods of policy
normalization to avoid taper-tantrum-like scenarios.
Similarly, a well-communicated plan for a gradual exit
from exceptional monetary policy and liquidity support
as the recovery strengthens would foster orderly market
transitions in emerging markets, too. The case studies

INFLATION SCARES

also highlight the importance of maintaining strong
fiscal credibility for inflation anchoring.
Third, policymakers need to walk a tightrope
between acting patiently to support the recovery and
at the same time preparing to act quickly if inflation
expectations show signs of de-anchoring. Central banks
could look beyond temporary inflationary pressures
and avoid tightening policies prematurely until there
is more clarity on underlying price dynamics (conditional on expectations remaining firmly anchored). At
the same time, central banks should also prepare to act
quickly if the need arises and chart contingent actions
that reveal their true preferences. Fiscal policies should
adhere to sustainable medium-term frameworks.
However, uncertainty about medium-term output
gaps is still high and could affect the optimal timing
for removal of policy support while the recovery is
still under way. Policies, therefore, should be mindful
of the unusual short-term dynamics and uncertainties
surrounding potential output.
Fourth, a key feature of the outlook is the significant
degree of cross-country heterogeneity among advanced
economies and emerging market and developing
economies and even within advanced economies.
While the United States is projected to drive much of
the slack-induced inflation dynamics in the baseline
for advanced economies, with near-term risks tilted to
the upside, underlying inflation dynamics in the euro
area and Japan remain weak. Policy recommendations
should be tailored to economies’ particular vulnerabilities and business cycle phases. Yet, spillovers from asynchronous monetary and fiscal tightening must be at
the core of multilateral policy discussions. For emerging markets, medium-term expectations rose sharply
during inflation scare episodes, which were preceded
by growing internal and external imbalances—all of
which underscores the role of strong macroeconomic
fundamentals and credible medium-term fiscal frameworks in keeping expectations anchored.

Box 2.1. Food Insecurity and Prices during COVID-19
Nominal global food prices have risen more than
40 percent since the start of the pandemic.1 The prices
of goods sold in a local market—a more relevant indicator, especially if the good is produced domestically (for
example, cassava in central and western Africa)—were
influenced by numerous local factors, including supply
and demand, government policies, exchange rates, transportation costs, and income levels. Data for monthly
market food prices across locations for seven staples
(wheat, rice, sugar, maize, milk, poultry, cassava), which

contribute about 60 percent of average daily consumption, from 259 markets in 73 emerging markets are
used. The real local price of staples in emerging markets
has increased by 4.0 percent since the pandemic
began.2 Significant price surges in staple foods in several
countries are observed. By contrast, a number of food-­
producing countries that experienced favorable weather
conditions have avoided upward price pressure.
In the absence of frictions, such as transportation
costs, prices tend to equalize across markets.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Recovery During a Pandemic

Box 2.2. Core Inflation in the COVID-19 Crisis
US headline inflation has risen sharply since the
start of the pandemic. To interpret such developments, economists distinguish between underlying
or “core” inflation, which reflects macroeconomic
conditions and is especially salient for monetary policy
deliberations, and transitory fluctuations around the
core arising from changes in relative prices caused by
microeconomic factors. But making this distinction is
challenging in the current environment because different measures of core inflation give different signals.
A common measure of core personal consumption
expenditure inflation that excludes food and energy prices
has recently spiked even higher than headline inflation.
But simply removing food and energy prices is not the
best way to measure core inflation: transitory movements
can arise in different industries (Dolmas 2005). These
concerns have led to core measurement based on median
inflation (the price change at the 50th percentile of all
prices each month) or on trimmed mean inflation (stripping out a fixed share of price changes).
Based on median or trimmed mean inflation, recent
developments are less alarming. This difference reflects
the large sectoral shocks to industries other than food

and energy, which caused the traditional measure to
rise sharply but are filtered out of median or trimmed
mean inflation. For example, the April 2021 inflation
spike reflected the prices of light trucks, hotel rooms,
air transportation, spectator sports, and car rentals,
which more than doubled at a monthly annualized
rate, while median inflation was only 2.8 percent
(Figure 2.2.1).
Which of these core measures is more relevant for
understanding the current situation? Historical data
suggest that it is median or trimmed mean inflation.
Figure 2.2.2 compares the volatility of inflation and the
strength of its relationship with unemployment using
different measures. Trimming more extreme price movements increases the stability of the underlying inflation
measure and strengthens its relationship with macroeconomic conditions. Inflation excluding food and energy
has been 70 percent more volatile than median inflation
and has had a much weaker relationship with unemployment. The COVID-19 crisis has strengthened the
case for median or trimmed mean inflation.

INFLATION SCARES

Box 2.3. Policy Responses and Expectations in Inflation Acceleration Episodes
United States 1965–83
Background: After two decades of low inflation
following World War II, inflation started to increase
gradually in the mid-1960s. Inflation continued to
drift upward during the 1970s amid several external
price shocks, high fiscal deficits due to military engagements and rising social spending, a likely overestimation of productivity growth and potential output, and
dovish destabilizing monetary policy.
Policy response and results: The 1978 HumphreyHawkins Act amended the Federal Reserve’s mandate
and enabled then-Federal Reserve Board Chair Paul
Volcker to aggressively raise interest rates. The federal
funds rate averaged 11.2 percent in 1979, the first
year of Volcker’s tenure, and rose to 20 percent in
June 1981. Inflation peaked in March 1980 at almost
15 percent and fell to 3 percent by 1983. The drop
was induced by a sharp demand-led recession that
raised the unemployment rate from 5.6 percent in
May 1979 to 10.8 percent in November 1982.
Policy conclusions: Important policy lessons were
learned from the US Great Inflation of the 1970s and
its demise. Central bank independence as a potential
mitigant to inflationary bias, as well as central bank
transparency, prudent medium-term fiscal planning,
and adherence to stabilizing monetary rules and inflation targeting became central.

Brazil 2002–05
Background: Currency depreciations coupled with
domestic and external shocks in 2001 triggered a
sudden stop in 2002. Brazil experienced a reversal in
capital flows and cuts to trade credit lines, and the real
depreciated by 53 percent in 2002. Inflation expectations rose along with the increase in inflation.
Policy response and results: Starting from low
monetary policy credibility and concerns about fiscal
dominance, policymakers decided against a gradual
tightening. A cumulative increase of 550 basis points
was implemented by February 2003, accompanied by
an increase in banks’ reserve requirements. Expectations began to lower only after the country’s monetary
policy committee kept the policy rate at 26.5 percent
in April 2003 for a third month in a row, despite
public outcry. Inflation expectations remained stable
until mid-2004. In September 2004, the committee

responded to rising inflation concerns by starting
another tightening cycle and clearly laying out conditions under which they would act. They committed
to a forward-looking inflation objective for 2005 and
announced that policy would respond asymmetrically
to inflation-increasing and -decreasing shocks. Expectations fell afterward, even as inflation continued to
rise, and expectations indeed converged to the target
by the end of 2005. The new government also made
efforts to assert a fiscally prudent policy.
Policy conclusions: Considered a stress test of a new
inflation-targeting framework, the experience showed
(1) the need for larger monetary policy action to
counter unanchored expectations and establish credibility, and (2) how clear and state-contingent guidance
could complement the initial response.

Chile 2007–09
Background: The Banco Central de Chile (BCC) formally adopted a flexible inflation-targeting framework
in 1999. Inflation expectations were well anchored
thereafter at about 3 percent. The new monetary
policy regime was accompanied by a credible fiscal
rule, sound financial sector regulation, and supervision. From mid-2007 to late 2008, however, Chile
experienced upward inflation pressure from international factors—rising copper, food, and energy prices.
Headline inflation exceeded the target range in August
2007. Inflation expectations began to increase and
moved above the 3 percent target by late 2008.
Policy response and results: In the second half of
2007 the BCC tightened monetary policy, raising the
policy rate by 25 basis points in July 2007. Despite a
cumulative rate increase of 325 basis points by September 2008, two-year-ahead expectations increased to
3.9 percent. The BCC was somewhat slow to act on
the rise in inflation for several reasons: (1) the degree
of slack in the economy did not rise as high as was
estimated, (2) the pass-through from the appreciating
exchange rate was lower than expected, and (3) the
size and persistence of the increase in agricultural commodity prices was unanticipated. The global financial
crisis then led to a recession and reversal of commodity prices rises, while inflation declined sharply and
expectations came down to target through 2009.
Policy conclusions: Even when expectations are well
anchored, risks to credibility could arise when inflation
moves far from its target or when it remains above its
band for an extended period.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Recovery During a Pandemic

Box 2.3 (continued)
India 2010–14
Background: Following a rebound after the global
financial crisis, growth began to slow in 2011 because of
domestic and external factors. The 2003 fiscal rule was
abandoned, leading to internal and external imbalances.
Inflation expectations were not anchored during this
time. At the first hint of US monetary policy tapering
on May 22, 2013, India’s large current account deficit
and excessive dependence on portfolio flows stood badly
exposed. A plunging rupee heightened concerns of even
higher inflation and risks of a ratings downgrade.
Policy response and results: A new central banker was
appointed and laid out several priorities on the first
day, September 2, 2013. Two things stood out: (1) a
pledge to restore confidence, and (2) a commitment to

make the central bank more transparent and predictable. A new inflation-targeting framework began
guiding policy and communications in January 2014.
Foreign exchange interventions to address commodity
price volatility accompanied this strategy. Confidence
in the country’s economy was achieved as rupee
expectations became firmly anchored and inflation and
inflation expectations were brought under control.
Policy conclusions: Monetary policy operations
improvements and communication strategies, along
with a transparent and credible commitment to reducing inflation, worked to disinflate from high levels.
The central bank’s success on this front opened up the
space to pursue other objectives without disturbing
inflation expectations.

RESEARCH AND INNOVATION: FIGHTING THE PANDEMIC AND BOOSTING
LONG-TERM GROWTH

How can policymakers boost long-term growth in the
post–COVID-19 global economy? This chapter looks at
the role of basic research—undirected, theoretical, or
experimental work. Using rich new data that draw on
connections from individual innovations to scientific articles, it shows that basic research is an essential input into
innovation, with wide-ranging international spillovers
and long-lasting impacts. International spillovers are particularly important for emerging market and developing
economies, where institutional factors—including better
education and deeper financial markets—help convert
innovation into economic growth, making rapid technology transfer, the free flow of ideas, and collaboration
across borders key priorities. Model-based analysis reveals
that advanced economies could raise long-term growth by
increasing research funding, targeting basic research, and
developing closer connections between public and private
research. By lifting the growth potential and future tax
base of the economy, these investments tend to pay for
themselves within a decade. Investments in basic research
may also have green benefits, as cleaner technological
innovations rely on newer, more fundamental research.
1

Introduction
Few concepts have implications as far reaching
for economic policy as long-term growth. Growth—
namely, the increase in an economy’s potential to
produce goods and services—is of central importance
not only for improving living standards, but also for
addressing inequality, debt sustainability, and the cost
of climate change mitigation.
Yet, the past few decades have seen a long and persistent decline in long-term growth. Policymakers face
an urgent and essential question: how can this trend be
reversed to build a more buoyant post-pandemic global
economy? Although this has so far been mostly an
advanced-economy phenomenon, demographic trends

in China and other emerging markets make the need
for an answer more urgent. With fewer active workers,
aging populations will require more output per worker
to maintain living standards.
Addressing this question requires an understanding of the underlying drivers of growth. The earliest
explanations emphasized the role of productivity—the
ability to create more outputs with the same inputs.1
More recent work emphasizes the role of innovation—
the emergence and adoption of new technologies that
improve the production of goods and services—as a
driver of productivity.2 But the data present something
of a challenge to this idea. Productivity growth has
slowed, even amid increased spending on research and
development—a common proxy for innovation effort
(Figure 3.1, panels 1 and 2). This apparent conflict
with leading theories makes formulating policies to
boost long-term growth rather difficult.
One possible answer is that the type of research
matters. Innovations, great and small, occur not in
a vacuum but draw on the stock of basic scientific
knowledge. The invention of the cardiac pacemaker
required a scientific understanding of both human
anatomy and electronics. The GPS technology familiar
to many smartphone users relies on Einstein’s theories
of relativity to account for how time passes at different
rates on fast-moving satellites and the Earth’s surface.
More recently, the extraordinarily rapid development
of COVID-19 vaccines, based on decades of prior
basic scientific research, has had the massive economic
payoff of bringing forward the reopening of many
economies, perhaps by years (Box 3.1). Growth in
research inputs has been increasingly applied, even as
innovation depends more on basic scientific advances
(Figure 3.1, panels 3 and 4), which may help resolve
part of this puzzle.
The character of basic scientific research also suggests that policies to encourage it might be particularly

potent—something relevant to aspirations to build a
better post–COVID-19 economy (see Chapter 1). In
contrast to applied innovation, basic research can have
very broad economic applications. While this likely
means that social returns from basic research are high,
it also means that firms may struggle to internalize the
gains from basic science, undermining private incentives. No firm could fully capture the gains from the
invention of, say, the jet engine or the internet. As a
result, private firms are likely to underprovide the most
basic, far-reaching, and economically impactful types
of research (Nelson 1959)—suggesting a role for public
policy to bridge this gap.
This chapter explores whether public policy should
support basic scientific research to boost growth during
the exit from the global pandemic, addressing the
following questions:
•• What is the progression from basic science to innovation
and productivity growth? How does basic scientific knowledge diffuse internationally? And how
do the economic roles of basic and more applied
research differ?
•• What is the global economic benefit of scientific integration? How might a reverse in scientific integration
of major economies, such as the United States and
China, affect global growth?
•• Is basic research under- or overprovided? Can policy
intervene to correct socially inefficient levels of
basic research? If so, what is the appropriate policy
mix? How should these policies balance returns
from public and private basic research? And what
are the potential gains from such policies? Can
basic scientific research help in the fight against
climate change? And if so, how might those benefits manifest?
These are the chapter’s main findings:
•• Basic scientific research is a key driver of innovation
and productivity, and basic scientific knowledge diffuses internationally farther than applied knowledge.
A 10 percent increase in domestic (foreign) basic
research is estimated to raise productivity by about
0.3 (0.6) percent, on average. International knowledge spillovers are more important for innovation in
emerging market and developing economies than in
advanced economies. Easy technology transfer, collaboration, and the free flow of ideas across borders
should be key priorities.
•• A decoupling of basic scientific research between the
United States and China could have big ­negative

CHAPTER 3

RESEARCH AND INNOVATION: FIGHTING THE PANDEMIC AND BOOSTING LONG-TERM GROWTH

effects on global productivity, with an estimated
first-round decline of up to 0.8 percent.
•• Basic scientific research in advanced economies
is underfunded. As a result, policies that fund
public research and subsidize private research will
have positive payoffs. A model estimated on three
advanced economies suggests that subsidy rates for
private research should be approximately doubled
and public research expenditure increased by about
one-third. Targeting support to basic scientific
research will deliver the greatest return but, where
this is not possible, more public-private partnerships
may be a partial substitute. While such policies pay
for themselves in the long term, optimal research
funding may be lower in countries with immediate
fiscal constraints. Science also plays a larger role in
green innovation than in dirty technological change,
suggesting that policies to boost science can help
tackle climate change.

Conceptual Framework
The chapter’s conceptual framework draws on
innovation-driven endogenous growth theory (Romer
1990; Grossman and Helpman 1991; Aghion and
Howitt 1992; Akcigit and Kerr 2018), in which
knowledge creation plays a central role in driving
productivity growth.
In its simplest form, economic output can be
thought of as produced by two interlinked production
functions (Figure 3.2). In the first, the production
function for ideas, research inputs—both basic and
applied—are combined with preexisting knowledge to
produce economically relevant innovations that add to
the stock of common knowledge. The key difference

between basic and applied research is that the former
is undirected, theoretical, or experimental, whereas
the latter is aimed at bringing products to market. In
the second production function (the one for goods
and services), standard macroeconomic inputs (capital and labor) are combined to produce output. The
productivity of this process depends on the current
stock of ideas and other country-specific institutional
factors. Thus, research increases knowledge, knowledge
enhances productivity, and productivity determines
how much final output is generated from real inputs.
Although the analysis in the chapter adds finer
details to this picture, the basic structure remains the
same throughout. The empirical analysis unpacks these
two production functions and estimates the direct
impact and international spillovers of investing in
basic science. Subsequent model-based policy analysis complements the empirical evidence by allowing
for richer interactions, including between basic and
applied research in general equilibrium. Given that the
analysis of the more basic types of research is novel, the
chapter’s focus is naturally on basic research. For more
on applied research, see the April 2016 Fiscal Monitor
and the April 2018 World Economic Outlook.

Connecting Basic Science to Growth
This section presents an empirical investigation into
the two production functions outlined in Figure 3.2,
extending it to include an international dimension,
distinguishing the impact not only of basic and applied
research but also the extent of international spillovers.
An important first step is to construct measures of the
stock of foreign knowledge accessible to each country.

Output

The relevance of knowledge in one country for
an innovator in another may depend on a variety of
factors, including proximity, language, and so forth,
and might be different for basic and applied knowledge. Cross-country citations in patent applications,
from the Reliance on Science database (RoS, for basic
research) and from PATSTAT (for applied research),
provide valuable clues about the drivers of the international transmission of knowledge.
The RoS database is a rich data set that tracks citations of some 38 million US and European patents to
scientific articles (Marx and Fuegi 2020). By providing
unique identifiers for patents issued by the US Patent

citations to Chinese science have grown strongly since

home bias, citing their own scientific works more than
others do. This suggests that diffusion of knowledge
from its source is partial—a point explored more formally in the next section.

both of the patent’s inventor(s) and of the authors of

European Patent Office, provides global coverage of
patent applications, with 105 million records from
more than 190 patenting offices. These sources illuminate two inputs to the production function for ideas,
basic and applied research, and are discussed in Online
Annex 3.1.3
A key assumption in the empirical work is that citations to scientific articles capture dependence on basic
research and that citations to patents capture reliance
on applied research. This draws a sharp distinction,
whereas reality is more blurred; some articles may
cover applied topics, and patentable work may spur
major scientific breakthroughs.4

To harness this information, the chapter estimates
a gravity-type model of international knowledge
flows. The outcome variable is the number of citations from one country to another. For example, for
basic research, this would be the number of citations
by, say, Malaysian inventors to scientific articles with
Spanish authors (for applied research, the citations
are to other patents). The explanatory variables are:
whether the two countries share a border, whether they
have a common official language, how specialization
in their economies differs (scientific specialization for
science citations, technological for patent citations),
and geographic distance in kilometers. Citing and
cited country fixed effects capture differences in the
knowledge mass, intellectual property rights, and other
factors that may influence a country’s propensity to
patent or to cite other patents. Further details are in
Online Annex 3.2.
Panel 1 of Figure 3.4 shows the estimated cumulative impact of these various barriers, calculated separately for basic and applied knowledge. These show
that basic knowledge diffuses more strongly than
applied knowledge, with the red line staying above
the blue line across most barriers. Country borders,
lack of a common language, and specialization distance all present a larger impediment to the diffusion
of applied knowledge. The marginal effect of geographic distance is negative for basic knowledge but
insignificant for applied knowledge. Patent-to-patent
citation intensity for applied knowledge is instead
likely more dependent on other factors, such as tough
competition. One example is the recent 5G technology race among China, the European Union, and
the United States. However, the cumulative effect
differs only over very long distances. These findings
are unaffected by a variety of robustness checks,
including controlling for cross-country differences
in scientific and technological output, as detailed in
Online Annex 3.2.

is new. Predictions of the estimated models can also
be used as a measure of how relevant knowledge in
one country is for research elsewhere. This point is
important for the empirical analysis of the production
function for ideas, which uses this measure to create
country-specific aggregate foreign knowledge stocks for
each country (more on this later).

This sort of exercise has a long history in the
academic literature on international trade. Earlier
attempts to adapt the framework to knowledge diffusion typically focused on applied knowledge flows
using patent-to-patent citations.5 The extension to
basic knowledge flows using patent-to-science citations
6

5The spatial diffusion of knowledge spillovers using patent data has
been widely studied, starting with Jaffe, Trajtenberg, and Henderson
(1993). See Peri (2005) for a more recent example. While advances in
communication have improved accessibility to scientific articles, there
is still evidence of the localization of scientific knowledge (for example,
Belenzon and Schankerman 2013), partly explained by national policies aimed at fostering collaboration among local universities, firms,
and government funding agencies (Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff 2000).
6,

Knowledge diffuses over time as well as across space.
Panel 2 of Figure 3.4 illustrates this point, showing the
density of the age of scientific articles (red line) and
patents (blue line) cited by various patents. As such,
they approximate the influence of basic and applied
knowledge over the years. Basic knowledge displays
a long-lasting impact, with the density for the age of
cited scientific articles reaching a peak at about eight
years versus three years for cited patents. This evidence
suggests that scientific ideas can still be economically
influential for long periods of time.6
Of course, using patent-induced knowledge flows
to understand innovation drivers is subject to some
caveats. Some research and development may have
a direct impact on productivity without necessarily
resulting in new patents, and new patent applications
may be more reflective of strategic patenting practices
than of authentic innovation. Yet, when using only
patents filed in at least two distinct national offices—a
likely control for these effects—the findings are similar
(Online Annex Table 3.2.3).

Knowledge Stocks and the Production Function for Ideas
The empirical production function for ideas explains
how the flow of new productive ideas—as captured by
patents—depends on foreign and domestic applied and
basic research stocks.
Given that these stocks are measures of research
expenditure (that is, research inputs), they are true
inputs to a production function. Domestic stocks
are computed by summing past expenditures, with
10 percent annual depreciation. Construction of the
foreign stocks follows Peri (2005). For each country,
a weighted average of the domestic research stocks in
all the other countries is calculated, with the weights
6A

back-of-the-envelope calculation of tail decay rates reveals
that, in the long term, basic (applied) knowledge decays at
7 (11) percent annually.

determined by the gravity model presented in this
chapter. For example, Mexico’s constructed foreign
basic research stock puts weight on the United States
that is proportional to the average Mexican inventor’s citations to science from the United States, as
predicted by the determinants of the gravity model—
geography, language, and technological mix. In this
sense, construction of the data measures how accessible
foreign research stocks are to a given country.
The estimated impact of research and development stocks on innovation is plotted in panel 1 of
Figure 3.5. The main estimates use dynamic ordinary
least squares, which efficiently utilize the cointegration
of the data.7 The point estimates show the effect of a
1-percentage-point increase in the respective research
stocks on the annual flow of patents, along with
95 percent confidence bands. For “own” basic research,
the impact is 0.67 percentage point, and for applied
research 0.77 percentage point, each having tight confidence bands. This suggests that domestic basic and
applied research each have positive effects on patenting
activity and are of similar magnitudes.
Foreign basic research also has a sizable effect,
leading annual patent flows to increase 1.36 percentage points. In contrast, foreign applied knowledge
has a negative estimated impact on patenting activity.
However, this is very imprecisely estimated. Indeed,
the magnitude of imprecision prohibits any confidence
about even the direction of the true effect. That said, a
negative impact of foreign applied research on domestic innovation is not completely implausible and would
at least be consistent with the idea that some applied
research and development leads to “business stealing”
by competitors (as opposed to the nonrival and nonexcludable nature of foreign basic research; see Bloom,
Schankerman, and Van Reenen 2013).8
Online Annex 3.3 shows the estimates of alternative specifications of the ideas production function.
While the details vary, the estimates consistently reveal
a strong and significant relationship between basic
research and innovation and positive spillovers from
foreign research (although the relative roles of foreign
basic and applied research are not always as clear).

that foreign research stocks are an order of magnitude larger
than domestic stocks and even larger for emerging market and developing economies. This affects the interpretation of the estimated
coefficients: a 1-percentage-point increase in foreign research is a
much larger change in the total knowledge. Further, the results in

RESEARCH AND INNOVATION: FIGHTING THE PANDEMIC AND BOOSTING LONG-TERM GROWTH

Differences in the Ideas Production Function: Advanced
versus Emerging Market and Developing Economies
The estimates presented so far reflect those for
an average economy in the data set. However, the
estimated effects of basic and applied research stocks
on innovations may differ by country. To get a sense
of the size of these differences and what drives them,
Figure 3.5 (panel 2) presents the estimated difference
between advanced economies and emerging market
and developing economies (see Table 3.3.2 in Online
Annex 3.3). Two findings are apparent:
•• First, access to foreign research has a larger estimated
effect on innovation in emerging markets than in
advanced economies. This is true for both applied
and basic research. Consistent with this difference,
inventors from emerging markets are also less likely
to cite homegrown research (Figure 3.5, panel 3).
The results suggest that foreign technology adoption
is more important for emerging markets than for
advanced economies, consistent with the April 2018
World Economic Outlook. Learning-by-doing is one
possible channel; adoption of foreign technologies
(for example, through trade links; see Chuang 1998)
may provide local workers the opportunity to learn
new processes, forming the basis for innovation.
•• Second, evidence for the role of domestic research
is mixed. While the estimated effect of applied
research on innovation is not significantly different
across emerging markets and advanced economies,
basic research seems to play a larger role in emerging
markets.9 It is possible that this reflects the larger
impact of basic science in niche fields that receive
less attention in advanced economies but may be
relevant in emerging markets.
10

Overall, these results emphasize the importance of
foreign knowledge for emerging market and developing
economies. Although domestic basic research is more
productive than for advanced economies in generating
innovation, the effect is even larger for foreign research.

The Production Function for Goods and Services
Building on the estimates of the ideas production function presented earlier, this section examines the link between innovation and productivity.
9Note, however, that the coefficient becomes insignificant
(although still positive) when China is excluded from the sample
(see Online Annex 3.3).
10,

The analysis relies on a production function for
output and estimates the long-term relationship
between productivity (real output per worker) and
the country-specific stock of innovation.10 This is the
empirical analogue of the production function for
output in Figure 3.2.
In this setting, the stock of innovations is measured using cumulated annual flows of new patents,
assuming an annual depreciation rate of 10 percent.
The regression also takes in the usual factors of
production, such as capital per worker and human
capital, along with country and time fixed effects.
Finally, the regression includes interactions between
innovation and institutional factors to allow institutions to affect the transmission from innovation to
productivity. Constant returns to scale are imposed,
and the estimation uses data covering 138 countries
during 1980–2017.11
The estimated relationship between innovation and
productivity is strong and significant (Figure 3.6).
An increase in the stock of patents by 1 percent is associated with an increase in productivity per worker of
0.04 percent,12 in line with estimates reported in Ulku
(2004) and dependent on the institutional features of
a country (Figure 3.6). The relationship is stronger for
countries with higher financial development and more
years of schooling, consistent with the idea that deeper
financial markets and more educated workforces help
transform innovation into productivity. Together with
the findings on strong spillovers from foreign research
(Figure 3.5, panel 2), these findings are relevant for
emerging market and developing markets, as these
results suggest that financial market and educational
reforms can allow countries to better absorb the stock
of foreign research.

Putting It All Together
This section combines the exercises of the previous sections to trace the path to the final impact of
increases in basic research stocks on productivity.
Specifically, Figure 3.7 (panel 1) shows that the estimated effect of a 10 percent permanent increase in the
stock of a country’s own basic research is to increase

productivity by 0.30 percent, while a similar increase
in the stock of foreign basic research is estimated
to have a larger impact, increasing productivity by
about 0.6 percent. The impact on productivity of own
applied research is estimated to be of the same order
as the impact of own basic research, and international
spillovers are insignificant. The differences are driven
by the respective elasticities estimated from the production function for ideas (Figure 3.5).
Overall, the evidence suggests that international
productivity spillovers are significant, particularly from
basic research. This is in line with the earlier evidence
on the extent of international spillovers in Figure 3.4,
which also suggests that basic knowledge diffuses more
widely and for a longer time than applied knowledge.
Hence, the type of research does seem to matter for
productivity growth. Quantitatively, however, large
confidence bands around those estimates suggest
caution in interpreting these results, especially on the
impact of foreign research (Figure 3.5). In addition, the linear regression approach measures only
the direct effect of basic research on innovation and

Policy Experiment: Scientific Decoupling between the
United States and China
In recent years, concern has been growing that
rising tensions between China and the United States
could lead to technological decoupling, with detrimental effects on innovation capacity and growth
at the global level. This section uses the empirical
13See the “Policy Analysis” section for general equilibrium effects
of policies stimulating basic research.
14,

CHAPTER 3

RESEARCH AND INNOVATION: FIGHTING THE PANDEMIC AND BOOSTING LONG-TERM GROWTH

framework described in this chapter to do a
back-of-the-envelope calculation of the cost for global
innovation of increased scientific decoupling between
the two countries.
The empirical framework can be used to model
scientific decoupling, implemented as a reduction in
the citation intensity between the two countries. This
reduces the foreign stock of basic research available
to each country, which in turn decreases innovation
and productivity. This is consistent with, for example,
differences in technology standards inducing changes
across the two countries, such that research done in
one becomes less relevant for the other. Limits on
knowledge flows might also arise if ongoing geopolitical tensions make it harder for researchers in the two
countries to interact or work together. For instance,
restriction on travel might prohibit the all-important
personal contacts that can occur at seminars, conferences, and the like.
Figure 3.7 shows the estimated impact on global
innovation as measured by the annual flow of new
patents for various degrees of scientific decoupling. As
a purely illustrative example, full decoupling, as modeled by citations between the two countries shrinking
to zero, is estimated to reduce global patent flows by
4.4 percent and global productivity by 0.8 percent.14
These estimates are likely a lower bound of the
impact of decoupling, for two reasons. First, they
assume that only foreign stocks of basic research,
innovation, and productivity for the United States
and China are affected in a decoupling scenario.
In reality, stocks in other countries are likely to be
affected too, creating an extra dimension to the shock.
Second, these estimates are partial insofar as they do
not include any general equilibrium effects that could
affect the impact of the initial shock on global innovation and productivity. Given the evidence presented
previously on the magnitude of global basic research
spillovers, these could be substantial.15

Policy Analysis
Earlier sections established the empirical links
between basic research, innovation, and economic
activity. This raises an obvious question: how can
14Online Annex 3.5 provides further details and a full breakdown
of these effects.
15See Cerdeiro and others (2021) for a more structural approach
to the decoupling issue.

public policy best exploit these links to boost living
standards? An important aspect of this empirical work
is that it measures only the direct part of these links,
holding all else fixed. But in reality, many indirect
channels exist. For instance, policies that boost basic
science spill over to increase returns to applied innovation, and changes in productivity feed back into wages,
driving demand and influencing research incentives.
To assess the impact of policy, a framework articulating
these links is required.

The Model
Recent work by Akcigit, Hanley, and
Serrano-Velarde (2021) provides a theoretical framework for answering this question. It analyzes a setting
in which firms conduct two types of research: basic,
which builds the stock of knowledge; and applied,
which converts knowledge into products. These
correspond closely to the basic and applied expenditure concepts used in the empirical analysis. The
government has three policy levers: subsidies for each
of the two types of research; and direct funding for
public basic research, such as universities and public
research labs.
The key feature of this approach is that basic
research is modeled as having applications in many different fields. This captures an essential aspect of basic
research—that, because individual firms typically operate in only a few sectors, they cannot profit fully from
the range of economic applications opened up by the
most fundamental and basic discoveries. As a result,
private incentives for basic research are outstripped by
its social benefits. Without a public policy response,
this will result in inefficiently low levels of innovation
and productivity.
Despite the special character of basic research, it is
not the only potential target of public policy in this
framework. Applied research—which is complementary to basic research, adapting knowledge to produce
marketable products—also generates spillovers, which
could also motivate public support. This is because
innovations that bring a product to market can be
superseded by competitors’ innovations. This introduces a “quality ladder” mechanism: firms may not
be able to fully internalize the social value of applied
innovation, leading to underprovision of applied
research as well. Whether applied or basic research
is more desirable is not hardwired into the model

but is instead a function of parameters estimated
from the data.
The model is estimated for three countries: France,
the United Kingdom, and the United States. Although
estimating for more countries would be ideal, the
data requirements needed to maintain the important distinction between basic and applied research
preclude this. Still, this exercise gives some sense of
the impact of country-specific factors, at least within
advanced economies.

International Monetary Fund | October 2021

Figure 3.8 shows optimal policies and the resultant outcomes from several experiments. The first,
shown in red, is the case when governments cannot
subsidize applied and basic research separately and,
so, must apply the same rate to both. This is not an
unreasonable approximation of reality, as deciding
which of firms’ individual activities are “applied” and
which are “basic” is often challenging and, so, being
able to target them separately may be difficult. Indeed,
many data sources for such subsidies cannot make this
distinction.
This exercise suggests that research, in general, is
funded below its socially optimal level. Subsidy rates
for private research should be doubled, and public
research expenditure increased by about one-third.
Although country-specific caveats (see “Policy Conclusions” below) might caution against a too-literal
interpretation of these findings, they are at least
broadly supportive of the notion that there are likely
underexploited spillovers from research that can
leave room for policy to make households better off.
Increasing subsidies and public research expenditures
as recommended would raise productivity growth in
the order of about 0.2 percentage point a year. This
would start to pay for itself within about a decade. If
applied over the period shown in panel 1 of Figure 3.1,
this would have resulted in current per capita incomes
about 12 percent higher than in the data. Moreover,
in an era of low real interest rates, small increases in
economic growth can have very large impacts on debt
sustainability.
Under this policy program, the stocks of both
applied and basic knowledge increase. But because
public expenditure is purely basic, the stock of basic
knowledge increases by more—with an increase about
several times the size of that for applied knowledge.
This increase in the knowledge stock also varies across

CHAPTER 3

RESEARCH AND INNOVATION: FIGHTING THE PANDEMIC AND BOOSTING LONG-TERM GROWTH

countries and is largest in the United States, where
higher corporate entry and exit rates mean that firms
do not internalize the social benefits of research,
leaving more room for policy to play a positive role.
The level of wages also rises under optimal policy,
with increases of between 2.5 percent and 3 percent,
depending on the country.
Of course, assuming that no scope exists for targeting subsidies might seem somewhat restrictive and,
so, the results of separately subsidizing applied and
basic research are also shown in Figure 3.8, in yellow.
This policy clearly dominates the previous one, which
implies that, where possible, governments should target
subsidies aggressively toward basic research. This policy
recommendation matches the earlier empirical evidence, which shows that basic research is an important
determinant of productivity growth.
Although targeting has only a minor additional
impact on growth, it reduces the cost of subsidies,
lowering taxes and making households substantially
better off. The intuition for this is that basic research
is a smaller sector than applied research. Given that
the subsidy is smaller, and growth spillovers from
basic research are larger than for applied research,
this achieves a similar growth effect but with a much
smaller subsidy. Lower subsidy spending can translate
into lower taxes, boosting household disposable income
and consumption permanently.

Exploring the Assumptions
As with any model-based analysis, the results depend
on the modeling assumptions. Here, two important
assumptions are explored in detail.
The first is the substitutability of public and private
research. In the baseline, this substitutability is imperfect; public research requires extra work to be useful
for commercial innovation—the “ivory tower” effect. If
this is turned off, public basic research can be commercialized more easily and can take on more of the
qualities of a public-private partnership.
The most obvious effect of this experiment is that
optimal research expenditure increases considerably,
to about 3 percent of GDP (Figure 3.8, panel 2, in
green). This is not surprising: a public sector that
can deliver more commercially adaptable innovations
means better use of resources. Optimal subsidies fall,
and growth increases by an average of another 0.1 percentage point. The policy implication is that, even
if discrimination between basic and applied research

subsidies is not possible, governments might be able to
achieve something similar by encouraging greater collaboration between public and private basic researchers.
The second experiment investigates how sensitive
these results are to assumptions about private basic
research spillovers. It is conceivable that spillovers from
private firms may decrease if, for example, recent technological change allows for more market power or other
abilities to privatize breakthroughs. To proxy this, the
blue bars in Figure 3.8 show what happens if the spillovers from private basic research shrink by one-quarter.
This limits public gains from research and, so, optimal
public subsidy rates are increased only by half relative
to the data (versus doubling in the baseline).

Policy Conclusions
The preceding experiments highlight four key
policy lessons.
•• First, public funding for research is too low. Gains
can be made from both subsidizing more private
research and doing more public research.
•• Second, the ability to discriminate among various types of research is very valuable. If possible,
governments could achieve similar outcomes to the
baseline at roughly half the cost.
•• Third, better connections between public and
private researchers might be able to substitute for
targeted subsidies, which can be hard to implement.
•• Fourth, regarding firms’ ability to protect their discoveries, if basic research spillovers decline, then the
social gains from research will fall. This suggests that
reducing overbearing market power or excessively
broad patenting can boost productivity and growth
(Box 3.3 discusses this issue more broadly).
As with any model-based analysis, tractability
demands that this assessment leave out a number of
other factors that could affect the policy conclusions.
As such, these conclusions should be treated as a baseline, from which country-specific considerations could
require some deviation.
One such issue is the absence of distorting taxation. In this setting, taxes are raised by collecting a
lump sum from households. In reality, though, most
tax instruments, such as labor or capital taxes, induce
some sort of inefficiency. Such instruments introduce an extra cost to policy interventions. Because
these costs typically increase with the size of the tax,
countries with high tax distortions may find policies
International Monetary Fund | October 2021

75

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Recovery During a Pandemic

to support basic research to be more costly. A similar
caveat applies to countries with high debt burdens or
inefficient revenue collection systems. In these cases, a
better source of funding might be to reprioritize expenditure or improve revenue mobilization.
Moreover, these policy conclusions are perhaps most
directly relevant to advanced economies: the model
lacks a channel (such as trade) for the international diffusion of knowledge, which earlier sections show to be
important in emerging market and developing economies. As such, these countries may find that policies to
better adapt foreign knowledge to local conditions are
a better avenue for development than investing directly
in homegrown basic research (Acemoglu, Aghion,
and Zilibotti 2006). Other unmodeled factors, such
as political constraints, may also hinder the kind of
tax-funded innovation-boosting policies presented here.

Conclusions: Investment in Basic Science
Boosts Productivity and Pays for Itself over
the Long Term
The development of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines
acts as a stark reminder of the importance of science
for innovation and growth. In common with other
technological breakthroughs, past scientific discoveries
in unrelated fields typically laid the foundation for
today’s technological advances, driving future productivity and economic growth (Box 3.1).
Improving growth outcomes will be essential to
post-pandemic economies, helping finance higher
public debt and additional post-pandemic social
expenditures. It is therefore worrisome that the share of
basic research has been steadily declining over the past
three decades.

76

International Monetary Fund | October 2021

That the private sector underinvests in basic research
is not surprising. As shown in this chapter, the benefits
of basic research are diffuse and long-lasting, making it an unattractive proposition for private firms.
This creates an opportunity for policy intervention.
The chapter shows that doubling subsidies to private
research and boosting public research expenditure by
one-third could increase annual growth per capita by
around 0.2 percent. Better targeting of subsidies and
closer public‑private cooperation could boost this
further, at lower public expense. Such investments
could start to pay for themselves within a decade or so.
The chapter also shows that scientific knowledge
travels far over time and distance and that it is a key
driver of innovation in both advanced economies and
emerging markets. Spillovers from advanced economies
to emerging markets are particularly large. Deep financial markets and better educational systems are key
facilitators for cross-border technology adoption.
It is also important to ensure the free flow of ideas
and scientific collaboration across borders, especially
for emerging markets. The technological trajectories
of China and the United States have been closely
linked in the past two decades. Rising political
tensions could lead to scientific decoupling, with
detrimental effects on innovation capacity and global
economic growth.
Beyond its impact on growth, basic science is likely
to be a key contributor to a greener future. The fight
against climate change requires drastic cuts in global
emissions. New clean technologies will be central to
this effort. Evidence presented in this chapter suggests
that investment in frontier science—especially in
natural sciences and engineering—could help speed the
transition toward a cleaner economy.

CHAPTER 3

RESEARCH AND INNOVATION: FIGHTING THE PANDEMIC AND BOOSTING LONG-TERM GROWTH

Box 3.1. mRNA Vaccines and the Role of Basic Scientific Research
Vaccines using new mRNA technology are key to
the fight against COVID-19; the most well-known are
those developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna.1
This technology uses genetic code known as messenger
RNA (or mRNA) to instruct human cells to make part
of the virus’s protective shell. These fragments help
train the body’s immune system to attack the real
virus. Compared with conventional approaches,
mRNA technology can deliver better-performing
vaccines with shorter research and production times.
Their social and economic impact has been enormous,
likely shortening the pandemic by years, and looks set
to revolutionize medical treatments in years to come.
This technology was built on waves of prior
scientific discoveries. To track these discoveries,
Figure 3.1.1 shows the publication dates of scientific
articles cited by five of the seven Moderna COVID-19
vaccine patents (in blue). This distribution captures
the direct dependence of vaccine development on

breakthroughs on the function of mRNA in the
early 2010s. To measure the indirect influence of
science, the yellow line shows the scientific citations
of the vaccine’s “parent” patents—other patents
referenced in the five original vaccine patents. These
peak in the early 2000s, tracking discoveries in editing
genetic codes. Earlier advances in reading genetic
codes drove a similar wave of citations from “grandparent” patents in the early 1990s. These waves of
scientific influence illustrate how policies that help
incentivize advances in basic science today influence the building blocks of future technologies and
yield long-lasting economic payoffs.
Developing mRNA vaccines relied on a
broad base of scientific knowledge. On average,
the Moderna vaccine patents are in the same
­technological category as only 55 percent of their
parent patents—a number that falls further as
citation chains lengthen (Figure 3.1.2). This shows
how wide-ranging basic science contributed to mRNA

vaccines, indicating that policies to develop a broad

ways.
The development of COVID-19 vaccines was
encouraged by unprecedented public support.
This included regulatory forbearance (emergency
use authorization of COVID-19 vaccines), at-risk
up-front investment and subsidies for vaccine production (Operation Warp Speed), help in scaling up
manufacturing (Indian government grants to vaccine
producers), joint licensing agreements with local
producers (India, South Africa), and advance public
purchase commitments (Israel, United Kingdom,

support for a COVID-19 vaccine was its continuation throughout the ­development process. Typically,
public funding is most generous for early trials, falling

public and academic funding for clinical trials
stayed high, even at the latest stages of development
(Figure 3.1.3). This highlights how support throughout the production process can incentivize research by
forward-looking firms.
Global distribution of vaccines remains a challenge.
Although reliable data are hard to come by, global supply seems sufficient. World production of COVID-19
vaccines is likely to hit almost two doses per capita by
the end of 2021—slightly less than demand. Although
supply disruptions and capacity constraints can hamper delivery of vaccines, even planned purchases are
unevenly distributed, with outsized demand in the
United States and Europe (Figure 3.1.4). Fair distribution of vaccines will require adjustment of planned
allocations, irrespective of where they are produced.

RESEARCH AND INNOVATION: FIGHTING THE PANDEMIC AND BOOSTING LONG-TERM GROWTH

Box 3.2. Clean Tech and the Role of Basic Scientific Research
Avoiding catastrophic climate change requires a
rapid reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases.
This will be possible only if global energy consumption transitions to predominantly clean (zero carbon
emissions) energy sources. Technological advances
to drive down the cost of clean energy are a key part
of any strategy to minimize the economic impact of
that switch. This box shows how investment in basic
research is especially important to foster innovation in
clean technologies and thus spur emission reductions.
This question is addressed using the patent-level
Reliance on Science data set. This includes detailed
information on the industrial category of its constituent patents, which is used to classify the technology
covered in each patent as a clean or a dirty innovation
(following Dechezleprêtre, Muckley, and Neelakantan
2020). Clean innovations include renewable energy
technology and electric vehicles; dirty innovations
cover gas turbines, furnaces, and the like. Comparing
the properties of clean and dirty innovations against
all other patents (as a benchmark) can help uncover
the relationship between scientific research and the
direction of technical change.1
The first dimension for comparing clean and dirty
patents is their relative citations to prior patents and
scientific articles. This contains information on how
various types of innovation depend on applied and
basic knowledge stocks. Figure 3.2.1 summarizes the
results of this exercise. The first panel shows that both
clean and dirty innovations cite less prior research than
other sorts of innovation. Clean innovations cite more
research than dirty innovations, but mainly within
scientific articles. With a sample of several million
patents, these differences are very precisely estimated.
The second panel compares the age of the research
used by clean and dirty innovation, which can be
thought of as a proxy for distance to the technological frontier. Clean innovations cite newer patents
and scientific articles than both dirty innovations
and other types of innovations. However, the
difference is largest for scientific articles, which
are, on average, 0.8 years newer than those cited

that account for third factors that might otherwise influence this
relationship. This includes the year that the patent is issued and
the country of the inventor.

by dirty innovation. In other words, clean breakthroughs rely more on scientific research closer to
the frontier than dirty innovation.
Figure 3.2.2 shows the fraction of scientific research
in various fields, relative to other patents. It shows
that clean innovation is particularly likely to rely on
research in engineering and technology and unlikely to
rely on medical research. Interestingly, dirty innovations cite the natural sciences much less frequently

Box 3.2 (continued)
than do clean ones. Unsurprisingly, neither clean nor
dirty innovation seems to depend much on research in
agriculture, social science, or the humanities.
Overall, the evidence presented here suggests that
clean innovations depend more than dirty ones on
frontier science, particularly natural sciences and
engineering. Accordingly, basic research investment

in these fields is likely to have a positive impact in
the fight against climate change. That said, public
promotion of basic research in these fields will be only
part of the solution. Other factors, such as incentives
to bring new clean technologies to market, as well as
addressing stranded assets associated with dirty fuels,
will also be important.

RESEARCH AND INNOVATION: FIGHTING THE PANDEMIC AND BOOSTING LONG-TERM GROWTH

Box 3.3. Intellectual Property, Competition, and Innovation
Intellectual property rights are among several public
policy tools to foster private innovation. Innovation
requires costly and risky up-front investments in
research and development. Thus, would-be innovating
firms may undertake them only with some guarantee that their ideas can be protected from potential
imitators, at least for some time. Intellectual property rights are designed to do just that. By granting
temporary monopoly power to inventors, intellectual
property rights make it profitable to invest in research
and development and incentivize a continuous flow
of innovation. Strong intellectual property rights also
complement growth-enhancing pro-competition policies, such as reduced market entry barriers and tougher
antitrust frameworks (Aghion, Howitt, and Prantl
2015). Competition is generally good for innovation
but, when too strong, it can weaken firms’ prospective monopoly rents and therefore their incentive to
innovate (April 2019 World Economic Outlook; IMF
2021), unless these future rents are well protected by
patent laws.
However, there is a limit to how strong intellectual
property rights should be. If overly protective they
can cement leading firms’ position and weaken their
incentive to innovate, discouraging lagging firms from
doing so as well (Akcigit and Ates 2021). This is particularly likely if patents excessively reward incremental
innovations, or if market leaders use them as barriers
to competition. “Patent thickets”—overly complicated
legal setups that require a firm to seek agreements with
many parties to use a technology—are an example
(Shapiro 2001).
The authors of this box are Romain Duval and Jean-Marc
Natal.

In sum, intellectual property rights should be neither
too weak nor too strong and they should reward
disruptive innovations far more than those that are
incremental. Yet, even when well calibrated, intellectual
property rights confer temporary monopoly power,
which delays the widespread dissemination of innovation to competitors and the general public. This could,
at times, run counter to society’s broader goals. In a
pandemic, for example, any delay in widespread vaccine production has enormous human and economic
costs. Therefore, during a public emergency, and when
the use of a targeted innovation is clearly identified,
governments should consider alternative, less distortive approaches. Tax credits for specific research and
development, direct government support, and innovation prizes, in particular, have been proposed in such
situations (Kremer and Williams 2010; Maskin 2020).
These policies better align society’s goals with private
incentives when the targeted innovation (for example, a
new vaccine) and success criteria (such as effectiveness
and safety) are well identified.
By covering costs and risks up front, Operation
Warp Speed generated the necessary incentives for
pharmaceutical companies to develop effective vaccines
in record time. Intellectual property rights also likely
helped stimulate the development of vaccines, but
at the risk of slowing global production in the near
future. In response, a proposal—supported by China,
Russia, and the United States—to temporarily waive
these rights for vaccines is currently under discussion
at the World Trade Organization. In future pandemics, alternative policy support, such as well-designed
innovation prizes, could be considered, which would
stimulate vaccine development just as powerfully while
also facilitating rapid vaccine dissemination.

STATISTICAL APPENDIX

T

he Statistical Appendix presents historical
data as well as projections. It comprises
eight sections: Assumptions, What’s New,
Data and Conventions, Country Notes,
Classification of Countries, General Features and
Composition of Groups in the World Economic Outlook,
Key Data Documentation, and Statistical Tables.
The first section summarizes the assumptions underlying the estimates and projections for
2021–22. The second section briefly describes the
changes to the database and statistical tables since
the April 2021 World Economic Outlook (WEO). The
third section offers a general description of the data
and the conventions used for calculating country group composites. The fourth section presents
selected key information for each country. The fifth
section summarizes the classification of countries in
the various groups presented in the WEO. The sixth
section provides information on methods and reporting standards for the member countries’ national
account and government finance indicators included
in the report.
The last, and main, section comprises the statistical
tables. (Statistical Appendix A is included here; Statistical Appendix B is available online at www.imf.org/en/
Publications/WEO).
Data in these tables have been compiled on the basis
of information available through September 27, 2021.
The figures for 2021–22 are shown with the same
degree of precision as the historical figures solely for
convenience; because they are projections, the same
degree of accuracy is not to be inferred.

Assumptions
Real effective exchange rates for the advanced economies are assumed to remain constant at their average
levels measured during July 23, 2021–August 20, 2021.
For 2021 and 2022 these assumptions imply average
US dollar–special drawing right (SDR) conversion rates

of 1.431 and 1.444, US dollar–euro conversion rates1
of 1.194 and 1.208, and yen–US dollar conversion
rates of 108.5 and 106.7, respectively.
It is assumed that the price of oil will average $65.68
a barrel in 2021 and $64.52 a barrel in 2022.
National authorities’ established policies are assumed
to be maintained. Box A1 describes the more specific
policy assumptions underlying the projections for
selected economies.
With regard to interest rates, it is assumed that the
London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) on six-month
US dollar deposits will average 0.2 percent in 2021
and 0.4 percent in 2022, the LIBOR on three-month
euro deposits will average –0.5 percent in 2021 and
2022, and the LIBOR on six-month yen deposits will
average –0.1 percent in 2021 and 0.0 percent in 2022.

What’s New
• Data for Andorra have been added to the database
and are included in the advanced economies group
composites.

Data and Conventions
Data and projections for 196 economies form the
statistical basis of the WEO database. The data are
maintained jointly by the IMF’s Research Department
and regional departments, with the latter regularly
updating country projections based on consistent
global assumptions.
Although national statistical agencies are the
ultimate providers of historical data and definitions,
1 In regard to the introduction of the euro, on December 31,
1998, the Council of the European Union decided that, effective
January 1, 1999, the irrevocably fixed conversion rates between the
euro and currencies of the member countries adopting the euro are
as described in Box 5.4 of the October 1998 WEO. See Box 5.4 of
the October 1998 WEO as well for details on how the conversion
rates were established. For the most recent table of fixed conversion
rates, see the Statistical Appendix of the October 2020 WEO.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: RECOVERY DURING A PANDEMIC

international organizations are also involved in statistical issues, with the objective of harmonizing methodologies for the compilation of national statistics,
including analytical frameworks, concepts, definitions,
classifications, and valuation procedures used in the
production of economic statistics. The WEO database
reflects information from both national source agencies
and international organizations.
Most countries’ macroeconomic data as presented
in the WEO conform broadly to the 2008 version
of the System of National Accounts (2008 SNA). The
IMF’s sector statistical standards—the sixth edition of
the Balance of Payments and International Investment
Position Manual (BPM6), the Monetary and Financial
Statistics Manual and Compilation Guide (MFSMCG),
and the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014
(GFSM 2014)—have been aligned with the SNA
2008. These standards reflect the IMF’s special interest
in countries’ external positions, financial sector stability, and public sector fiscal positions. The process of
adapting country data to the new standards begins in
earnest when the manuals are released. However, full
concordance with the manuals is ultimately dependent
on the provision by national statistical compilers of
revised country data; hence, the WEO estimates are
only partly adapted to these manuals. Nonetheless, for
many countries, conversion to the updated standards
will have only a small impact on major balances and
aggregates. Many other countries have partly adopted
the latest standards and will continue implementation
over a number of years.2
The fiscal gross and net debt data reported in the
WEO are drawn from official data sources and IMF
staff estimates. While attempts are made to align gross
and net debt data with the definitions in the GFSM, as
a result of data limitations or specific country circumstances, these data can sometimes deviate from the
formal definitions. Although every effort is made to
ensure the WEO data are relevant and internationally
comparable, differences in both sectoral and instrument coverage mean that the data are not universally
comparable. As more information becomes available,
changes in either data sources or instrument coverage can give rise to data revisions that can sometimes
2 Many countries are implementing the SNA 2008 or European
System of National and Regional Accounts (ESA) 2010, and a few
countries use versions of the SNA older than that from 1993. A
similar adoption pattern is expected for the BPM6 and GFSM 2014.
Please refer to Table G, which lists the statistical standards each
country adheres to.

be substantial. For clarification on the deviations in
sectoral or instrument coverage, please refer to the
metadata for the online WEO database.
Composite data for country groups in the WEO are
either sums or weighted averages of data for individual
countries. Unless noted otherwise, multiyear averages
of growth rates are expressed as compound annual rates
of change.3 Arithmetically weighted averages are used
for all data for the emerging market and developing
economies group—except data on inflation and money
growth, for which geometric averages are used. The
following conventions apply:
Country group composites for exchange rates, interest rates, and growth rates of monetary aggregates are
weighted by GDP converted to US dollars at market
exchange rates (averaged over the preceding three
years) as a share of group GDP.
Composites for other data relating to the domestic
economy, whether growth rates or ratios, are weighted
by GDP valued at purchasing power parity as a share
of total world or group GDP.4 Annual inflation rates
are simple percentage changes from the previous years,
except in the case of emerging market and developing
economies, for which the rates are based on logarithmic differences.
Composites for real GDP per capita in purchasing
power parity terms are sums of individual country data
after conversion to the international dollar in the years
indicated.
Unless noted otherwise, composites for all sectors
for the euro area are corrected for reporting discrepancies in intra-area transactions. Unadjusted annual GDP
data are used for the euro area and for the majority
of individual countries, except for Cyprus, Ireland,
Portugal, and Spain, which report calendar-adjusted
data. For data prior to 1999, data aggregations apply
1995 European currency unit exchange rates.

3 Averages for real GDP, inflation, GDP per capita, and commodity prices are calculated based on the compound annual rate of
change; averages for the unemployment rate are based on the simple
arithmetic average.

revised purchasing-power-parity-based weights as well as “Revised
Purchasing Power Parity Weights” in the July 2014 WEO Update,

STATISTICAL APPENDIX

Composites for fiscal data are sums of individual
country data after conversion to US dollars at the average market exchange rates in the years indicated.
Composite unemployment rates and employment
growth are weighted by labor force as a share of group
labor force.
Composites relating to external sector statistics are
sums of individual country data after conversion to
US dollars at the average market exchange rates in the
years indicated for balance of payments data and at
end-of-year market exchange rates for debt denominated in currencies other than US dollars.
Composites of changes in foreign trade volumes and
prices, however, are arithmetic averages of percent changes
for individual countries weighted by the US dollar value
of exports or imports as a share of total world or group
exports or imports (in the preceding year). Unless noted
otherwise, group composites are computed if 90 percent
or more of the share of group weights is represented.
Data refer to calendar years, except in the case of a
few countries that use fiscal years; Table F lists the economies with exceptional reporting periods for national
accounts and government finance data for each country.
For some countries, the figures for 2020 and earlier
are based on estimates rather than actual outturns;
Table G lists the latest actual outturns for the indicators
in the national accounts, prices, government finance,
and balance of payments indicators for each country.

Country Notes
For Afghanistan, all projections for 2021–26 are
omitted due to an unusually high degree of uncertainty.
For Albania, projections were prepared prior to the
2021 Article IV mission that ended on October 11, 2021,
and thereby do not reflect updates during the mission.
For Argentina, fiscal and inflation variables are
excluded from publication for 2021–26 as these are to a
large extent linked to still-pending program negotiations.
The official national consumer price index (CPI) for
Argentina starts in December 2016. For earlier periods,
CPI data for Argentina reflect the Greater Buenos Aires
Area CPI (prior to December 2013), the national CPI
(IPCNu, December 2013 to October 2015), the City
of Buenos Aires CPI (November 2015 to April 2016),
and the Greater Buenos Aires Area CPI (May 2016 to
December 2016). Given limited comparability of these
series on account of differences in geographical coverage,
weights, sampling, and methodology, the average CPI
inflation for 2014–16 and end-of-period inflation for

2015–16 are not reported in the October 2021 WEO.
Also, Argentina discontinued the publication of labor
market data in December 2015 and new series became
available starting in the second quarter of 2016.
Data and forecasts for Bangladesh are presented on a
fiscal year basis starting with the October 2020 WEO.
However, the real GDP and purchasing-power-parity
GDP aggregates that include Bangladesh are based on
calendar year estimates.
For Costa Rica, the central government definition
has been expanded as of January 1, 2021, to include
51 public entities as per Law 9524. Data are adjusted
back to 2019 for comparability.
The fiscal series for the Dominican Republic have
the following coverage: public debt, debt service, and
the cyclically adjusted/structural balances are for the
consolidated public sector (which includes central
government, the rest of the nonfinancial public sector,
and the central bank); and the remaining fiscal series
are for the central government.
The fiscal data for Ecuador reflect net lending/
borrowing for the nonfinancial public sector.
Ecuadorian authorities, with technical support from the
IMF, are undertaking revisions of the historical fiscal
data for the net lending/borrowing of the nonfinancial
public sector over 2012–17, with the view of correcting
recently identified statistical errors in data compilation
at the subnational level and the consistency between
above-the-line and financing data by subsectors.
For Ethiopia, projections for 2022–26 are omitted
due to an unusually high degree of uncertainty.
India’s real GDP growth rates are calculated as per
national accounts: for 1998 to 2011, with base year
2004/05 and, thereafter, with base year 2011/12.
For Lebanon, projections for 2021–26 are omitted
due to an unusually high degree of uncertainty. Official
GDP numbers are available only through 2019.
Against the backdrop of a civil war and weak capacity, the reliability of Libya’s data, especially regarding
national accounts and medium-term projections, is low.
Data for Syria are excluded from 2011 onward
because of the uncertain political situation.
For Turkmenistan, national accounts data are IMF staff
estimates compiled in line with international methodologies (SNA), using official estimates and sources as
well as United Nations and World Bank databases. The
Turkmenistan authorities’ estimate of real GDP growth in
2020 is 5.9 percent. Estimates and projections of the fiscal
balance exclude receipts from domestic bond issuances as
well as privatization operations, in line with GFSM 2014.

The authorities’ official estimates on fiscal accounts, which
are compiled using domestic statistical methodologies,
include bond issuance and privatization proceeds as part
of government revenues.
Ukraine’s revised national accounts data are available
beginning in 2000 and exclude Crimea and Sevastopol
from 2010 onward.
In December 2020 the Uruguay authorities began
reporting the national accounts data according to SNA
2008, with the base year 2016. The new series begin
in 2016. Data prior to 2016 reflect the IMF staff’s best
effort to preserve previously reported data and avoid
structural breaks.
Starting in October 2018 Uruguay’s public pension system has been receiving transfers in the context of a new
law that compensates persons affected by the creation of
the mixed pension system. These funds are recorded as
revenues, consistent with the IMF’s methodology. Therefore, data and projections for 2018–21 are affected by
these transfers, which amounted to 1.2 percent of GDP
in 2018, 1.1 percent of GDP in 2019, and 0.6 percent
of GDP in 2020, and are projected to be 0.3 percent
of GDP in 2021, and 0.0 percent thereafter. See IMF
Country Report 19/64 for further details.5 The disclaimer
about the public pension system applies only to the
revenues and net lending/borrowing series.
The coverage of the fiscal data for Uruguay was
changed from consolidated public sector to nonfinancial public sector with the October 2019 WEO. In
Uruguay, nonfinancial public sector coverage includes
central government, local government, social security
funds, nonfinancial public corporations, and Banco de
Seguros del Estado. Historical data were also revised
accordingly. Under this narrower fiscal perimeter—
which excludes the central bank—assets and liabilities
held by the nonfinancial public sector where the counterpart is the central bank are not netted out in debt
figures. In this context, capitalization bonds issued in
the past by the government to the central bank are
now part of the nonfinancial public sector debt. Gross
and net debt estimates for 2008–11 are preliminary.
Projecting the economic outlook in Venezuela,
including assessing past and current economic developments as the basis for the projections, is complicated
by the lack of discussions with the authorities (the last
Article IV consultation took place in 2004), incomplete
understanding of the reported data, and difficulties in

Country Report 19/64 (Washington, DC: International Monetary
Fund, February 2019).

interpreting certain reported economic indicators given
economic developments. The fiscal accounts include the
budgetary central government; social security; FOGADE
(insurance deposit institution); and a sample of public enterprises, including Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A.
(PDVSA); and data for 2018–21 are IMF staff estimates. The effects of hyperinflation and the paucity of
reported data mean that the IMF staff’s projected macroeconomic indicators need to be interpreted with caution.
For example, nominal GDP is estimated assuming the
GDP deflator rises in line with the IMF staff’s projection of average inflation. Public external debt in relation
to GDP is projected using the IMF staff’s estimate of
the average exchange rate for the year. Wide uncertainty
surrounds these projections. Venezuela’s consumer prices
are excluded from all WEO group composites.
In 2019 Zimbabwe authorities introduced the Real
Time Gross Settlement dollar, later renamed the
Zimbabwe dollar, and are in the process of redenominating their national accounts statistics. Current data
are subject to revision. The Zimbabwe dollar previously ceased circulating in 2009, and during 2009–19,
Zimbabwe operated under a multicurrency regime
with the US dollar as the unit of account.

Classification of Countries
Summary of the Country Classification
The country classification in the WEO divides the
world into two major groups: advanced economies
and emerging market and developing economies.6 This
classification is not based on strict criteria, economic
or otherwise, and it has evolved over time. The objective is to facilitate analysis by providing a reasonably
meaningful method of organizing data. Table A provides an overview of the country classification, showing
the number of countries in each group by region and
summarizing some key indicators of their relative size
(GDP valued at purchasing power parity, total exports
of goods and services, and population).
Some countries remain outside the country classification and therefore are not included in the analysis. Cuba
and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea are
examples of countries that are not IMF members, and
the IMF therefore does not monitor their economies.
6 As used here, the terms “country” and “economy” do not always
refer to a territorial entity that is a state as understood by international law and practice. Some territorial entities included here are
not states, although their statistical data are maintained on a separate
and independent basis.

STATISTICAL APPENDIX

General Features and Composition of Groups in
the World Economic Outlook Classification
Advanced Economies
Table B lists the 40 advanced economies. The seven
largest in terms of GDP based on market exchange
rates—the United States, Japan, Germany, France,
Italy, the United Kingdom, and Canada—constitute
the subgroup of major advanced economies, often
referred to as the Group of Seven. The members of the
euro area are also distinguished as a subgroup. Composite data shown in the tables for the euro area cover
the current members for all years, even though the
membership has increased over time.
Table C lists the member countries of the European
Union, not all of which are classified as advanced
economies in the WEO.

Emerging Market and Developing Economies
The group of emerging market and developing
economies (156) includes all those that are not classified as advanced economies.
The regional breakdowns of emerging market and
developing economies are emerging and developing
Asia; emerging and developing Europe (sometimes
also referred to as “central and eastern Europe”); Latin
America and the Caribbean; Middle East and Central
Asia (which comprises the regional subgroups Caucasus and Central Asia; and Middle East, North Africa,
Afghanistan, and Pakistan); and sub-Saharan Africa.
Emerging market and developing economies are also
classified according to analytical criteria that reflect
the composition of export earnings and a distinction between net creditor and net debtor economies.
Tables D and E show the detailed composition of
emerging market and developing economies in the
regional and analytical groups.
The analytical criterion source of export earnings
distinguishes between the categories fuel (Standard
International Trade Classification [SITC] 3) and

nonfuel and then focuses on nonfuel primary products
(SITCs 0, 1, 2, 4, and 68). Economies are categorized
into one of these groups if their main source of export
earnings exceeded 50 percent of total exports on average between 2016 and 2020.
The financial and income criteria focus on net creditor economies, net debtor economies, heavily indebted
poor countries (HIPCs), low-income developing countries
(LIDCs), and emerging market and middle-income
economies (EMMIEs). Economies are categorized as net
debtors when their latest net international investment
position, where available, was less than zero or their
current account balance accumulations from 1972
(or earliest available data) to 2020 were negative. Net
debtor economies are further differentiated on the basis
of experience with debt servicing.7
The HIPC group comprises the countries that are
or have been considered by the IMF and the World
Bank for participation in their debt initiative known
as the HIPC Initiative, which aims to reduce the
external debt burdens of all the eligible HIPCs to
a “sustainable” level in a reasonably short period of
time.8 Many of these countries have already benefited
from debt relief and have graduated from the initiative.
The LIDCs are countries that have per capita
income levels below a certain threshold (set at $2,700
in 2016 as measured by the World Bank’s Atlas
method), structural features consistent with limited
development and structural transformation, and external financial linkages insufficiently close for them to be
widely seen as emerging market economies.
The EMMIEs group comprises emerging market and
developing economies that are not classified as LIDCs.
7 During 2016–20, 32 economies incurred external payments
arrears or entered into official or commercial bank debt-rescheduling
agreements. This group is referred to as economies with arrears and/or
rescheduling during 2016–20.

and Sukwinder Singh, “Debt Relief for Low-Income Countries:
The Enhanced HIPC Initiative,” IMF Pamphlet Series 51

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: RECOVERY DURING A PANDEMIC

Box A1. Economic Policy Assumptions underlying the Projections for Selected Economies
Fiscal Policy Assumptions
The short-term fiscal policy assumptions used in
the World Economic Outlook (WEO) are normally
based on officially announced budgets, adjusted for
differences between the national authorities and the
IMF staff regarding macroeconomic assumptions and
projected fiscal outturns. When no official budget
has been announced, projections incorporate policy
measures judged likely to be implemented. The
medium-term fiscal projections are similarly based on
a judgment about policies’ most likely path. For cases
in which the IMF staff has insufficient information to
assess the authorities’ budget intentions and prospects
for policy implementation, an unchanged structural
primary balance is assumed unless indicated otherwise.
Specific assumptions used in regard to some of the
advanced economies follow. (See also Tables B4 to B6
in the online section of the Statistical Appendix for
data on fiscal net lending/borrowing and structural
balances.)1
Australia: Fiscal projections are based on data from
the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the FY2021/22
budget of the Commonwealth government, the
FY2020/21 and FY2021/22 budget published by
each state/territory government, the FY2021/22
budget published by some state governments (as of
September 10), and the IMF staff’s estimates and
projections.
Austria: Fiscal projections are based on the 2021
budget, the Austria Stability Programme, and
Austria National Reform Programme 2021. The new
EU recovery funds have been incorporated in the
projections.

1The output gap is actual minus potential output, as a
­ ercentage of potential output. Structural balances are expressed
p
as a percentage of potential output. The structural balance is the
actual net lending/borrowing minus the effects of cyclical output
from potential output, corrected for one-time and other factors,
such as asset and commodity prices and output composition
effects. Changes in the structural balance consequently include
effects of temporary fiscal measures, the impact of fluctuations
in interest rates and debt-service costs, and other noncyclical
fluctuations in net lending/borrowing. The computations of
structural balances are based on the IMF staff’s estimates of
potential GDP and revenue and expenditure elasticities. (See
Annex I of the October 1993 WEO.) Net debt is calculated as
gross debt minus financial assets corresponding to debt instruments. Estimates of the output gap and of the structural balance
are subject to significant margins of uncertainty.

104

International Monetary Fund | October 2021

Belgium: Projections are based on the 2020–21
Stability Program, the Draft Budgetary Plan for 2020,
and other available information on the authorities’
fiscal plans, with adjustments for the IMF staff’s
assumptions.
Brazil: Fiscal projections for 2021 reflect policy
announcements as of May 31, 2021. Medium-term
projections reflect full compliance with Brazil’s constitutional expenditure ceiling.
Canada: Projections use the baseline forecasts from
the Federal Budget 2021 and the latest provincial budgets. The IMF staff makes some adjustments to these
forecasts, including for differences in macroeconomic
projections. The IMF staff’s forecast also incorporates
the most recent data releases from Statistics Canada’s
National Economic Accounts, including quarterly
federal, provincial, and territorial budgetary outturns.
Chile: Projections are based on the authorities’ budget
projections, adjusted to reflect the IMF staff’s projections
for GDP, copper prices, depreciation, and inflation.
China: After a large fiscal expansion estimated for
2020, a significant tightening is projected for 2021
based on the government’s 2021 budget and the fiscal
outturn to date.
Denmark: Estimates for the current year are aligned
with the latest official budget numbers, adjusted
where appropriate for the IMF staff’s macroeconomic
assumptions. Beyond the current year, the projections incorporate key features of the medium-term
fiscal plan as embodied in the authorities’ latest
budget. Structural balances are net of temporary
fluctuations in some revenues (for example, North
Sea revenue, pension yield tax revenue) and one-offs
(COVID-19–related one-offs are, however, included).
France: Projections for 2021 onward are based on
the measures of the 2018–21 budget laws and the
amendment to the 2021 budget voted in July 2021,
adjusted for differences in revenue projections and
assumptions on macroeconomic and financial variables.
Germany: The IMF staff’s projections for 2021 and
beyond are based on the 2021 budgets, the 2022 draft
budget plan, and data updates from the national statistical agency (Destatis) and the ministry of finance,
adjusted for differences in the IMF staff’s macroeconomic framework and assumptions concerning
revenue elasticities. The estimate of gross debt includes
portfolios of impaired assets and noncore business
transferred to institutions that are winding up as well
as other financial sector and EU support operations.

STATISTICAL APPENDIX

Box A1 (continued)
Greece: Historical data since 2010 reflect adjustments in line with the primary balance ­definition
under the enhanced surveillance framework
for Greece.
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region: Projections
are based on the authorities’ medium-term fiscal
projections of expenditures.
Hungary: Fiscal projections include the IMF staff’s
projections of the macroeconomic framework and
fiscal policy plans announced in the 2020 budget.
India: Historical data are based on budgetary execution data. Projections are based on available information on the authorities’ fiscal plans, with adjustments
for the IMF staff’s assumptions. Subnational data are
incorporated with a lag of up to one year; general
government data are thus finalized well after central
government data. IMF and Indian presentations
differ, particularly regarding disinvestment and
license-auction proceeds, net versus gross recording of
revenues in certain minor categories, and some public
sector lending. Starting in FY2020/21 expenditure also
includes the off-budget component of food subsidies
consistent with the revised treatment of food subsidies
in the budget. Staff adjust expenditure to take out
payments for previous years’ food subsidies, which
are included as expenditure in budget estimates for
FY2020/21 and FY2021/22.
Indonesia: The IMF staff’s projections are based on
moderate tax policy and administration reforms, some
expenditure realization, and a gradual increase in capital
spending over the medium term in line with fiscal space.
Ireland: Fiscal projections are based on the country’s
Budget 2021 and Stability Programme Update 2021.
Israel: Historical data are based on government
finance statistics data prepared by the Central Bureau
of Statistics. Projections are based on figures from the
ministry of finance for the execution of the coronavirus fiscal package during 2020 and assumes partial
implementation of the package for 2021.
Italy: The IMF staff’s estimates and projections are
informed by the fiscal plans included in the government’s 2021 budget and amendments. The stock
of maturing postal bonds is included in the debt
projections.
Japan: The projections reflect fiscal measures already
announced by the government, with adjustments for
the IMF staff’s assumptions.
Korea: The forecast incorporates the overall fiscal balance in the 2021 annual and supplementary budgets

and the medium-term fiscal plan announced with the
2021 budget, and the IMF staff’s adjustments.
Mexico: The 2020 public sector borrowing requirements estimated by the IMF staff adjusts for some
statistical discrepancies between above-the-line
and below-the-line numbers. Fiscal projections for
2021–22 are informed by the estimates in the 2022
budget proposal; projections for 2023 onward assume
continued compliance with rules established in the
Fiscal Responsibility Law.
The Netherlands: Fiscal projections for 2020–26 are
based on the IMF staff’s forecast framework and are
also informed by the authorities’ draft budget plan
and Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis projections. Historical data were revised following the June
2014 Central Bureau of Statistics release of revised
macroeconomic data because of the adoption of the
European System of National and Regional Accounts
and revisions of data sources.
New Zealand: Fiscal projections are based on the
Budget Economic and Fiscal Update 2021 and the
IMF staff’s estimates.
Portugal: The projections for the current year are
based on the authorities’ approved budget, adjusted
to reflect the IMF staff’s macroeconomic forecast.
Projections thereafter are based on the assumption of
unchanged policies.
Puerto Rico: Fiscal projections are based on the
Puerto Rico Fiscal and Economic Growth Plans
(FEGPs), which were prepared in August 2021, and
are certified by the Financial Oversight and Management Board. The 2021 Fiscal Plan calls for a series of
structural reforms, such as earned income tax credit
benefits; the Natural Assistance Program; a lowering
of barriers to entry for foreign firms; and investment
in education, the power sector, and infrastructure.
The new fiscal plan also pays particular attention to
allocating strategic investment to emergency response
and frontline service delivery, as the island is highly
vulnerable to natural disasters and battling an ongoing
pandemic. This plan represents an unprecedented level
of fiscal support—over 100 percent of Puerto Rico’s
gross national product. The Fiscal Plan also focuses
on the implementation of fiscal measures (centralization of fiscal authority, improvement of agencies’
efficiency, Medicaid reform, pension reform, reduction of appropriations, enhanced tax compliance, and
optimized taxes and fees) that will result in a smaller
government deficit in the long term. The IMF staff’s

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: RECOVERY DURING A PANDEMIC

Box A1 (continued)
fiscal projections rely on the information presented
above as well as on the assumption that the fiscal
position will deteriorate over time. Previous WEO
submissions (prior to fall 2021) relied on the assumption of fiscal consolidation. Although IMF policy
assumptions are similar to those in the FEGP scenario
with full measures, the IMF staff’s projections of fiscal
revenues, expenditures, and balance are different from
the FEGPs’. This stems from two main differences in
methodologies: first, while IMF staff’s projections are
on an accrual basis, the FEGPs’ are on a cash basis.
Second, the IMF staff and the FEGP make very different macroeconomic assumptions.
Russia: Fiscal policy was countercyclical in 2020.
There will be some degree of consolidation in 2021 in
line with economic recovery, and the deficit is likely to
come back to the fiscal rule’s limit in 2022.
Saudi Arabia: The IMF staff’s baseline fiscal projections are based on its understanding of government
policies as outlined in the 2021 budget. Export oil
revenues are based on WEO baseline oil price assumptions and staff’s understanding of current oil policy
under the OPEC+ (Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries, including Russia and other nonOPEC oil exporters) agreement.
Singapore: For FY2020 estimates are based on
budget execution through the end of 2020. FY2021
projections are based on the initial budget of February
16, 2021. The IMF staff assumes gradual withdrawal
of remaining exception measures in FY2022 and
unchanged policies for the remainder of the projection
period.
South Africa: Fiscal assumptions draw on the 2021
Budget. Nontax revenue excludes transactions in
financial assets and liabilities, as they involve primarily revenues associated with realized exchange rate
valuation gains from the holding of foreign currency
deposits, sale of assets, and conceptually similar items.
Spain: Fiscal projections for 2021 include COVID19–related support measures, the legislated increase in
pensions, and the legislated revenue measures. Fiscal
projections from 2022 onward assume no policy
changes. Disbursements under the EU Recovery and
Resilience Facility are reflected in the projections for
2021–24.
Sweden: Fiscal estimates for 2020 are based on
preliminary information on the fall 2020 budget bill.
The impact of cyclical developments on the fiscal

106

International Monetary Fund | October 2021

accounts is calculated using the 2014 Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development elasticity2
to take into account output and employment gaps.
Switzerland: The authorities’ announced discretionary stimulus—as reflected in the fiscal projections
for 2020 and 2021—is permitted within the context
of the debt brake rule in the event of “exceptional
circumstances.”
Turkey: The basis for the projections in the WEO
and Fiscal Monitor is the IMF-defined fiscal balance,
which excludes some revenue and expenditure items
that are included in the authorities’ headline balance.
United Kingdom: Fiscal projections are based on
the latest GDP data published by the Office of
National Statistics on February 12, 2021, and forecasts by the Office for Budget Responsibility from
November 23, 2020. Revenue projections are adjusted
for differences between the IMF staff’s forecasts of
macroeconomic variables (such as GDP growth and
inflation) and the forecasts of these variables assumed
in the authorities’ fiscal projections. Projections assume
that the measures taken in response to the coronavirus
outbreak expire as announced. It is also assumed that
there is some additional fiscal consolidation relative to
the policies announced to date starting in FY2023/24
with the goal of stabilizing public debt within five
years. The IMF staff’s data exclude public sector banks
and the effect of transferring assets from the Royal
Mail Pension Plan to the public sector in April 2012.
Real government consumption and investment are
part of the real GDP path, which, according to the
IMF staff, may or may not be the same as projected
by the UK Office for Budget Responsibility. Data are
presented on a calendar year basis.
United States: Fiscal projections are based on the
July 2021 Congressional Budget Office baseline,
adjusted for the IMF staff’s policy and macroeconomic
assumptions. Projections incorporate the effects of the
proposed American Jobs Plan; the American Families
Plan; the Bipartisan Infrastructure Plan; the legislated
American Rescue Plan; the Coronavirus Preparedness
and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act; the
Families First Coronavirus Response Act; the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act; and the
2 Robert Price, Thai-Thanh Dang, and Yvan Guillemette,

Surveillance,” OECD Economics Department Working
Paper 1174 (Paris: OECD Publishing, 2014).

Box A1 (continued)
Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care
Enhancement Act. Finally, fiscal projections are
adjusted to reflect the IMF staff’s forecasts for key
macroeconomic and financial variables and different
accounting treatment of financial sector support and
of defined-benefit pension plans, and are converted
to a general government basis. Data are compiled
using SNA 2008, and when translated into government finance statistics, this is in accordance with the
Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014. Because of
data limitations, most series begin in 2001.

Monetary Policy Assumptions
Monetary policy assumptions are based on the
established policy framework in each country. In most
cases, this implies a nonaccommodative stance over the
business cycle: official interest rates will increase when
economic indicators suggest that inflation will rise
above its acceptable rate or range; they will decrease
when indicators suggest inflation will not exceed the
acceptable rate or range, that output growth is below
its potential rate, and that the margin of slack in the
economy is significant. On this basis, the London
interbank offered rate on six-month US dollar deposits
is assumed to average 0.2 percent in 2021 and 0.4
percent in 2022 (also see Table 1.1 in Chapter 1).
The rate on three-month euro deposits is assumed to
average –0.5 percent in 2021 and 2022. The rate on
six-month Japanese yen deposits is assumed to average
–0.1 percent in 2021 and 0.0 percent in 2022.
Australia: Monetary policy assumptions are
based on the IMF staff’s analysis and the expected
inflation path.
Brazil: Monetary policy assumptions are consistent
with the convergence of inflation toward the middle of
the target range at the end of 2022.
Canada: Monetary policy assumptions are based on
the IMF staff’s analysis.
Chile: Monetary policy assumptions are consistent
with attaining the inflation target.
China: Monetary policy is expected to be moderately tight in 2021, which will remain in place
into 2022.
Denmark: Monetary policy is to maintain the peg to
the euro.
Euro area: Monetary policy assumptions for euro area
member countries are in line with market expectations.

Greece: Interest rates are based on the WEO London
interbank offered rate, with an assumption of a spread
for Greece. Broad money projections are based on
monetary financial institution balance sheets and
deposit flow assumptions.
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region: The IMF
staff assumes that the currency board system will
remain intact.
India: Monetary policy projections are consistent
with achieving the Reserve Bank of India’s inflation
target over the medium term.
Indonesia: Monetary policy assumptions are in line
with inflation within the central bank’s target band
over the medium term.
Israel: Monetary policy assumptions are based on
gradual normalization of monetary policy.
Italy: The IMF staff’s estimates and projections are
informed by the actual outturn and policy plans by
the Bank of Italy and the European Central Bank’s
monetary policy stance forecast from the IMF’s euro
area team.
Japan: Monetary policy assumptions are in line with
market expectations.
Korea: The projections assume that the policy rate
evolves in line with market expectations.
Mexico: Monetary policy assumptions are consistent
with attaining the inflation target.
The Netherlands: Monetary projections are based
on the IMF staff-estimated six-month euro London
interbank offered rate projections.
New Zealand: Monetary projections are based on
the IMF staff’s analysis and expected inflation path.
Portugal: Monetary policy assumptions are based on
the IMF staff’s analysis, given input projections for the
real and fiscal sectors.
Russia: Monetary projections assume that the
Central Bank of the Russian Federation is adopting a
moderately tight monetary policy stance.
Saudi Arabia: Monetary policy projections are based
on the continuation of the exchange rate peg to the
US dollar.
Singapore: Broad money is projected to grow in line
with the projected growth in nominal GDP.
South Africa: Monetary policy assumptions are
consistent with maintaining inflation within the
3–6 percent target band.
Spain: Monetary projection growth is in proportion
to nominal GDP growth.

STATISTICAL APPENDIX

Box A2. Climate Change and Emissions Data in Figure 1.21
Data and estimates of historical greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions and nationally determined contributions (NDCs) come from the IMF’s Climate Change
Indicators Dashboard, coordinated by the IMF’s
Statistics Department. The historical GHG emissions
reported in Figure 1.21, panel 1, exclude emissions
and removals from land use, land-use change, and
forestry. As such, they represent emissions of major
GHGs due to human activity, especially in the
energy sector. The estimate includes total emissions
of (1) carbon dioxide emissions from energy use and
industrial processes (for example, cement production);
(2) methane emissions from solid waste, livestock,
mining of hard coal and lignite, rice paddies, agriculture, and leaks from natural gas pipelines; (3) nitrous
oxide; (4) hydrofluorocarbons; (5) perfluorocarbons;
(6) sulphur hexafluoride; and (7) nitrogen trifluoride.
The 2019–30 GHG emissions projected under
business as usual, excluding land use, land-use change,
and forestry, represent an estimate of GHG emissions
assuming that current trends in consumption and production technology continue to 2030. The projections
are estimated using the Carbon Pricing Assessment Tool
developed by IMF and World Bank staff. This tool
estimates energy-related GHG emissions, holding nonenergy emissions fixed at 2018 levels using projections
of GDP, taxation regimes, global energy prices, along
with assumptions on income, price elasticities, and
rates of technological change. The economy-wide GHG
emissions projected under NDCs for 2030 (nationally
determined contributions) reflect IMF calculations of
individual countries’ stated emission targets for 2030
(as of August 2021). The information is obtained from
NDC submissions by countries under the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
The GHG emissions target for well below 2°C
warming cap in 2030 and target for 1.5°C warming
cap in 2030 are derived using pathways and carbon
budgets adapted from the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change’s “Special Report: Global Warming
of 1.5°C” (commonly referred to as SR15; see IPCC
2018) and its “Sixth Assessment Report” (commonly
referred to as AR6; see IPCC 2021). The 1.5°C target
represents the emissions level in 2030 on pathway
P2 (“no or limited overshoot”) in SR15, adapted to
correspond to the updated 1.5°C budgets in AR6,
and scaled to GHGs according to the estimated

share of carbon dioxide in all GHGs, consistent
with Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)
2.6 (estimated in Matthews and others 2017). The
“well below” 2°C target for 2030 is estimated using
budgets achieving 1.8°C at the 80 percent confidence
band (the inferred confidence level for scenario P2 for
1.5°C in SR15, given carbon budgets in AR6) and
then scaled to total GHGs using the same assumed
proportionate share of carbon dioxide in total GHGs
for 1.5°C (85.9 percent in 2030).
Revenues from environmental taxes are defined as
the revenues arising from charges levied on a physical unit of an item that has a proven negative impact
on the environment (examples include taxes levied
on a gallon of gasoline, airline tickets, and tons of
carbon dioxide emissions). Expenditures on environment include government spending on a specified
set of activities, as outlined by the framework of the
Classification of Functions of Government, such as pollution abatement, protection of biodiversity, and waste
management (IMF 2014).

Note: The estimates in this table are based on individual countries’ national accounts and balance of payments statistics. Country group composites are calculated as the sum of the US dollar
values for the relevant individual countries. This differs from the calculations in the April 2005 and earlier issues of the World Economic Outlook, in which the composites were weighted by
GDP valued at purchasing power parities as a share of total world GDP. The estimates of gross national savings and investment (or gross capital formation) are from individual countries’
national accounts statistics. The estimates of the current account balance, the capital account balance, and the financial account balance (or net lending/net borrowing) are from the balance of
payments statistics. The link between domestic transactions and transactions with the rest of the world can be expressed as accounting identities. Savings (S) minus investment (I) is equal to
the current account balance (CAB) (S − I = CAB). Also, net lending/net borrowing (NLB) is the sum of the current account balance and the capital account balance (KAB) (NLB = CAB + KAB). In
practice, these identities do not hold exactly; imbalances result from imperfections in source data and compilation as well as from asymmetries in group composition due to data availability.
1Excludes the Group of Seven (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, United States) and euro area countries.

IMF EXECUTIVE BOARD DISCUSSION OF THE OUTLOOK,
OCTOBER 2021

The following remarks were made by the Chair at the conclusion of the Executive Board’s discussion of the
Fiscal Monitor, Global Financial Stability Report, and World Economic Outlook on September 28, 2021.

E

xecutive Directors broadly agreed with staff’s
assessment of the global economic outlook,
risks, and policy priorities. They welcomed the
continuing recovery, despite the resurgence of
the pandemic driven by more contagious new variants
of the virus and the ongoing supply shortages that
brought the inflation risk to the forefront. Directors
acknowledged that economic divergences, especially
between advanced economies and low-income countries, brought on by the pandemic seem more persistent, a reflection of differentiated vaccine access and
early policy support. In this context, Directors highlighted the importance of global cooperation to ensure
universal access to vaccines and a strong financial
safety net. To ensure a successful exit from the crisis,
these efforts will need to be coupled with sound policy
frameworks and ambitious domestic reforms, which
would facilitate new growth opportunities, including
from digitalization and green technology, while confronting climate change and rising inequality.
Directors concurred that uncertainties around the
baseline projections remain large and that the risks
to growth outcomes are tilted to the downside. They
stressed that the economic outlook continues to
depend heavily on the path of the health crisis and the
speed at which widespread vaccination can be reached.
Directors also acknowledged that the uncertainty
surrounding inflation prospects—primarily stemming
from the path of the pandemic, the duration of supply
disruptions, and how inflation expectations may evolve
in this environment—is particularly large. They noted
that while inflation expectations appear well-anchored,
inflation risks could prompt a faster-than-anticipated
monetary normalization in advanced economies.
Higher debt levels and large government financing
needs in many countries are also a source of vulnerability, especially if global interest rates were to rise faster
than expected.

Directors highlighted that policy choices have
become more difficult, confronting multidimensional
challenges—subdued employment growth, rising
inflation, food insecurity, the setback to human capital
accumulation, and climate change—with limited room
to maneuver. They stressed that multilateral efforts to
avoid international trade and supply chain disruptions,
speed up global vaccine access, provide liquidity and
debt relief to constrained economies, and mitigate
and adapt to climate change continue to be essential.
Directors further agreed that it is crucial to ensure that
financially constrained countries can continue essential
spending while meeting other obligations, and highlighted the expected contribution of the recent General
Allocation of Special Drawing Rights in providing the
much-needed international liquidity. At the national
level, Directors agreed that policy priorities should
continue to be tailored to local pandemic and economic
conditions, aiming to overcome the still-evolving health
crisis and promote an inclusive recovery while protecting the credibility of policy frameworks. As the recovery
progresses, policymakers will need to shift to measures
that aim to reverse scarring from the crisis.
Directors noted that fiscal policy should remain
supportive but needs to be well-targeted, carefully
calibrated, and tailored to country-specific circumstances. In countries with high levels of vaccination and
low funding costs, fiscal policy should gradually shift
from pandemic-fighting emergency measures toward
promoting a transformation to more resilient and
inclusive economies. In countries with lower vaccination rates and tighter financing constraints, health-­
related spending and protecting the most vulnerable
will remain top priorities. As countries converge back
to precrisis GDP trends, the focus should shift toward
ensuring fiscal sustainability, including through establishing credible medium-term fiscal frameworks, which
would also promote fiscal transparency and sound

151

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: Recovery During a Pandemic

governance practices. Given likely long-lasting negative
impacts on budget revenues in developing economies,
further efforts will be needed to mobilize revenues in
the medium term and improve expenditure efficiency.
While recognizing that the international community
provided critical support to alleviate fiscal vulnerabilities
in low-income countries, Directors noted that more is
needed, including through debt relief in the context of
early and timely implementation of multilateral initiatives, such as the G20 Common Framework.
Directors concurred that monetary policy should
remain accommodative where there are output gaps,
inflation pressures are contained, and inflation expectations are consistent with central bank targets. However,
they noted that central banks should be prepared to act
quickly if the recovery strengthens faster than expected
or if inflation expectations are rising. Directors stressed
that transparent and clear communication about the
outlook for monetary policy is critical at the current
juncture to avoid de-anchoring of inflation expectations and prevent financial instability.
Directors noted that financial vulnerabilities
continue to be elevated in several sectors—including
nonbank financial institutions, nonfinancial corporates,

152

International Monetary Fund | October 2021

and the housing market—masked in part by the very
substantial policy stimulus. They highlighted that a
prolonged period of extremely easy financial conditions, while needed to sustain the economic recovery,
may result in overly stretched asset valuations and
further fuel financial vulnerabilities. Directors agreed
that policymakers should act preemptively to address
vulnerabilities and avoid a buildup of legacy problems.
They should also tighten selected macroprudential
tools to tackle pockets of elevated vulnerabilities while
avoiding a broad tightening of financial conditions.
Directors agreed that some emerging and frontier
markets continue to face large financing needs. While
the outlook for capital flows has improved and monetary conditions remain still broadly accommodative,
a sudden change in the monetary policy stance of
advanced economies may result in a sharp tightening
of financial conditions, adversely affecting capital flows
and exacerbating pressures in countries facing debt
sustainability concerns. They concurred that the policy
response in these countries will need to be centered on
implementing structural reforms, rebuilding buffers,
and strengthening financial market governance and
infrastructure.
