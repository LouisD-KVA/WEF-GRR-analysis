Foreword
This publication marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the WMO Statement on the State
of the Global Climate, which was first issued
in 1994. The 2019 edition treating data for
2018 marks sustained international efforts
dedicated to reporting on, analysing and
understanding the year-to-year variations
and long-term trends of a changing climate.
Substantial knowledge has been produced
and delivered annually during this period
to inform WMO Member States, the United
Nations system and decision-makers about
the status of the climate system. It complements the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) five-to-seven year reporting
cycle in producing updated information for
the United Nations Framework Convention
for Climate Change and other climate-related
policy frameworks.
Since the Statement was first published,
climate science has achieved an unprecedented degree of robustness, providing
authoritative evidence of global temperature
increase and associated features such as
sea-level rise, shrinking sea ice, glacier mass
loss and extreme events linked to increasing
temperatures, such as heatwaves. There are
still areas that need more observations and
research, including assessing the contribution of climate change to the behaviour of
extreme events and to ocean currents and
atmospheric jet streams that can induce
extreme cold spells in some places and mild
conditions in others.
Key findings of this Statement include
the striking consecutive record warming
recorded from 2015 through 2018, the continuous upward trend in the atmospheric

concentration of the major greenhouse gases,
the increasing rate of sea-level rise and the
loss of sea ice in both northern and southern
polar regions.
The understanding of the linkage between the
observed climate variability and change and
associated impact on societies has also progressed, thanks to the excellent collaboration
of sister agencies within the United Nations
system. This current publication includes some
of these linkages that have been recorded in
recent years, in particular from 2015 to 2018,
a period that experienced a strong influence
of the El Niño and La Niña phenomena in
addition to the long-term climate changes.
Global temperature has risen to close to 1 °C
above the pre-industrial period. The time
remaining to achieve commitments under
the Paris agreement is quickly running out.
This report will inform the United Nations
Secretary-General’s 2019 Climate Action
Summit. I therefore take this opportunity to
thank all the contributors – authors, National
Meteorological and Hydrological Services,
global climate data and analyses centres,
Regional Specialized Meteorological Centres,
Regional Climate Centres and the United
Nations agencies that have collaborated on
this authoritative publication.

Statement by the United Nations
Secretary-General
The data released in this report give cause for
great concern. The past four years were the
warmest on record, with the global average
surface temperature in 2018 approximately
1 °C above the pre-industrial baseline.
These data confirm the urgency of climate
action. This was also emphasized by the
recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) special report on the impacts
of global warming of 1.5 °C. The IPCC found
that limiting global warming to 1.5 °C will
require rapid and far-reaching transitions in
land, energy, industry, buildings, transport,
and cities, and that global net human-caused
emissions of carbon dioxide need to fall by
about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, reaching
“net zero” around 2050.

There is no longer any time for delay. I commend
this report as an indispensable contribution
to global efforts to avert irreversible climate
disruption.

To promote greater global ambition on
addressing climate change, I am convening
a Climate Action Summit on 23 September.
The Summit aims to mobilize the necessary political will for raising ambition as

we work to achieve the goals of the Paris
Agreement. Specifically, I am calling on all
leaders to come to New York in September
with concrete, realistic plans to enhance
their nationally determined contributions by
2020 and reach net zero emissions around
mid-century. The Summit will also demonstrate transformative action in all the areas
where it is needed.

Statement by the President of the
United Nations General Assembly
This wide ranging and significant report by the World
Meteorological Organization clearly underlines the need
for urgent action on climate change and shows the value
of authoritative scientific data to inform governments in
their decision-making process. It is one of my priorities as
President of the General Assembly to highlight the impacts
of climate change on achieving the sustainable development goals and the need for a holistic understanding of
the socioeconomic consequences of increasingly intense
extreme weather on countries around the world. This
current WMO report will make an important contribution
to our combined international action to focus attention
on this problem.

TEMPERATURE
The global mean temperature for 2018 is
estimated to be 0.99 ± 0.13 °C above the preindustrial baseline (1850–1900). The estimate
comprises five independently maintained
global temperature datasets and the range
represents their spread (Figure 1).

Above-average temperatures were widespread in 2018 (Figure 2). According to
continental numbers from NOAA, 2018 was
ranked in the top 10 warmest years for Africa,
Asia, Europe, Oceania and South America.
Only for North America did 2018 not rank
among the top 10 warmest years, coming
eighteenth in the 109-year record.

0.86 °C above the pre-industrial baseline. For
comparison, the average anomaly above the
same baseline for the most recent decade
2009–2018 was 0.93 ± 0.07 °C,1 and the average for the past five years, 2014–2018, was
1.04 ± 0.09 °C above this baseline. Both of
these periods include the warming effect of
the strong El Niño of 2015–2016.

2025

The year 2018 was the fourth warmest on
record and the past four years – 2015 to
2018 – were the top four warmest years in
the global temperature record. The year 2018
was the coolest of the four. In contrast to the
two warmest years (2016 and 2017), 2018
began with weak La Niña conditions, typically
associated with a lower global temperature.
The IPCC special report on the impacts of
global warming of 1.5 °C (Global Warming
of 1.5 °C) reported that the average global
temperature for the period 2006–2015 was

There were a number of areas of notable
warmth. Over the Arctic, annual average
temperature anomalies exceeded 2 °C widely
and 3 °C in places. Although Arctic temperatures were generally lower than in the record
year of 2016, they were still exceptionally
high relative to the long-term average. An
area extending across Europe, parts of North
Africa, the Middle East and southern Asia was
also exceptionally warm, with a number of
countries experiencing their warmest year on
record (Czechia, France, Germany, Hungary,

The large number of existing indicators produced by climate scientists are useful for many
specific technical and scientific purposes and audiences. They are thus not all equally
suitable for helping non-specialists to understand how the climate is changing. Identifying
a subset of key indicators that capture the components of the climate system and their
essential changing behaviour in a comprehensive way helps non-scientific audiences to
easily understand the changes of key parameters of the climate system.
The World Meteorological Organization uses a list of seven state-of-the-climate indicators
that are drawn from the 55 Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) Essential Climate
Variables, including surface temperature, ocean heat content, atmospheric carbon dioxide
(CO2), ocean acidification, sea level, glacier mass balance and Arctic and Antarctic sea ice
extent. Additional indicators are usually assessed to allow a more detailed picture of the
changes in the respective domain. These include in particular – but are not limited to – precipitation, GHGs other than CO2, snow cover, ice sheet, extreme events and climate impacts.

DATA SOURCES AND BASELINES FOR GLOBAL TEMPERATURE
The assessment of global temperatures
presented in the Statement is based on
five datasets. Three of these are based on
temperature measurements made at weather
stations over land and by ships and buoys
on the oceans, combined using statistical
methods. Each of the data centres, NOAA
NCEIs,1 NASA GISS, 2 and the Met Office
Hadley Centre and Climatic Research Unit at
the University of East Anglia, 3 processes the
data in different ways to arrive at the global
average. Two of the datasets are reanalysis
datasets – from ECMWF and its Copernicus
Climate Change Service (ERA-Interim), and
JMA (JRA-55). Reanalyses combine millions
of meteorological and marine observations,
including from satellites, with modelled values
to produce a complete “reanalysis” of the
atmosphere. The combination of observations
with models makes it possible to estimate
temperatures at any time and in any place
across the globe, even in data-sparse areas
such as the polar regions. The high degree
of consistency of the global averages across
these datasets demonstrates the robustness
of the global temperature record.
Global temperatures are usually expressed as
“anomalies”, that is, temperature differences
from the average for a particular baseline
period. Although actual temperatures can
vary greatly over short distances – for example, the temperature difference between the
top and bottom of a mountain – temperature
anomalies are representative of much wider
areas. That is, if it is warmer than normal at
the top of the mountain, it is probably warmer
than normal at the bottom of it. Averaged
over a month, coherent areas of above- or
below-average temperature anomalies can
extend for thousands of kilometres. To get
a reasonable measurement of the global
temperature anomaly, one needs only a few
stations within each of these large coherent
areas. On the other hand, obtaining an accurate measurement of the actual temperature
requires far more stations and careful, representative sampling of many different climates.

The UK Met Office Hadley Centre and Climatic Research
Unit at the University of East Anglia produce and maintain

The period chosen as a baseline against which
to calculate anomalies usually depends on
the application. Commonly used baselines
include the periods 1961–1990, 1981–2010 and
1850–1900. The last of these is often referred to
as a pre-industrial baseline. For some applications, for example assessing the temperature
change during the twentieth century, the choice
of baseline can make little or no difference.
The period 1961–1990 is currently recommended by WMO for climate change
assessments. This baseline period was used
extensively in the past three IPCC assessment
reports (AR3, AR4 and AR5) and therefore
provides a consistent point of comparison
over time. Considerable effort has been made
to calculate and disseminate climate normals
for this period.
A commonly used value for the absolute
global average temperature for 1961–1990 is
14 °C. This number is not known with great
precision, however, and may be half a degree
higher or lower. As explained previously, this
margin of error for this actual temperature
value is considerably larger than is typical for
an annually averaged temperature anomaly,
which is usually around 0.1 °C.
The 1981–2010 baseline period is used for
climate monitoring. A recent period such as
this one is often preferred because it is most
representative of current or “normal” conditions. These 30-year averages are, indeed,
often referred to as “climate normals”. Using
a 1981–2010 normal means that it is possible
to use data from satellite instruments and
reanalyses for comparison, which do not
often extend much further back in time. The
1981–2010 period is around 0.3 °C warmer
than 1961–1990.
The period 1850–1900 was used to represent
“pre-industrial” conditions in the IPCC Global
Warming of 1.5 °C report and is the period
adopted in this Statement. Monitoring global
temperature differences from pre-industrial
conditions is important because the Paris
Agreement seeks to limit global warming to
1.5 °C or 2 °C above pre-industrial conditions.
The downside of using this baseline are that
there are relatively few observations from
this time and consequently there are larger
uncertainties associated with this choice.
The 1850–1900 period is around 0.3 °C cooler
than 1961–1990.

In contrast, areas of below-average temperatures over land were more limited. Parts of
North America and Greenland, central Asia,
western parts of North Africa, parts of East
Africa, coastal areas of western Australia and
western parts of tropical South America were
cooler than average, but not unusually so.

globally averaged mole fractions of CO2 at
405.5 ± 0.1 parts per million (ppm), methane
(CH4) at 1 859 ± 2 parts per billion (ppb) and
nitrous oxide (N2O) at 329.9 ± 0.1 ppb (Figure 3).
These values constitute, respectively, 146%,
257% and 122% of pre-industrial levels (before
1750). Global average figures for 2018 will
not be available until late 2019, but real-time
data from a number of specific locations,
including Mauna Loa (Hawaii) and Cape Grim
(Tasmania) indicate that levels of CO2, CH4 and
N2O continued to increase in 2018. The IPCC
Global Warming of 1.5 °C report found that
limiting warming to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial
temperatures implies reaching net zero CO2
emissions globally around 2050, and this with
concurrent deep reductions in emissions of
non-CO2 forcers, particularly CH4.

GREENHOUSE GASES AND OZONE

CARBON BUDGET

Increasing levels of GHGs in the atmosphere
are key drivers of climate change. Atmospheric
concentrations reflect a balance between
sources (including emissions due to human
activities) and sinks (for example, uptake
by the biosphere and oceans). In 2017, GHG
concentrations reached new highs, with

Accurately assessing CO2 emissions and their
redistribution within the atmosphere, oceans,
and land – the “global carbon budget” – helps
us capture how humans are changing the
Earth’s climate, supports the development
of climate policies, and improves projections
of future climate change.

For Europe as a whole, 2018 was one of the
three warmest years on record. Other areas of
notable warmth included the south-western
United States, eastern parts of Australia (for
the country overall it was the third warmest
year) and New Zealand, where it was the joint
second warmest year on record.

In broad terms, “blue carbon” refers to carbon stored, sequestered and cycled through
coastal and ocean ecosystems. However, in climate mitigation, coastal blue carbon (also
known as “coastal wetland blue carbon”)1 is defined as the carbon stored in mangroves,
tidal salt marshes, and seagrass meadows within the soil; the living biomass above ground
(leaves, branches, stems); the living biomass below ground (roots and rhizomes); and the
non-living biomass (litter and dead wood)2 (see table). When protected or restored, coastal
blue carbon ecosystems act as carbon sinks (see figure (a)).They are found on every continent except Antarctica and cover approximately 49 Mha.
Currently, for a blue carbon ecosystem to be recognized for its climate mitigation value within
international and national policy frameworks it is required to meet the following criteria:
(a) Quantity of carbon removed and stored or prevention of emissions of carbon by the
ecosystem is of sufficient scale to influence climate;
(b) Major stocks and flows of GHGs can be quantified;
(c) Evidence exists of anthropogenic drivers impacting carbon storage or emissions;
(d) Management of the ecosystem that results in increased or maintained sequestration
or emission reductions is possible and practicable;
(e) Management of the ecosystem is possible without causing social or environmental
harm.
However, the ecosystem services provided by mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrasses
are not limited to carbon storage and sequestration. They also support improved coastal
water quality, provide habitats for economically important fish species, and protect coasts
against floods and storms. Recent estimates revealed that mangroves are worth at least
US$ 1.6 billion each year in ecosystem services.
Despite the proven importance for ocean health and human well-being, mangroves, tidal
marshes and seagrasses are being lost at a rate of up to 3% per year (see table). When
degraded or destroyed, these ecosystems emit the carbon they have stored for centuries
into the ocean and atmosphere and become sources of GHGs (see figure, (b)).
Based on IPCC data it is estimated that as much as a billion tons of CO2 are being released
annually from degraded coastal blue carbon ecosystems (from all three systems – mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrasses), which is equivalent to 19% of emissions from tropical
deforestation globally.3

Carbon sequestration and release in intact and degraded coastal ecosystems – (a): In intact coastal wetlands (from left to right:
mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrasses), carbon is taken up via photosynthesis (purple arrows) and sequestered in the long
term into woody biomass and soil (red dashed arrows) or respired (black arrows). (b): When soil is drained from degraded
coastal wetlands, the carbon stored in the soils is consumed by microorganisms, which respire and release CO 2 as a metabolic
waste product. This happens at an increased rate when the soils are drained and oxygen is more available, which leads to
greater CO 2 emissions. The degradation, drainage and conversion of coastal blue carbon ecosystems from human activity (that
is, deforestation and drainage, impounded wetlands for agriculture, dredging) result in a reduction in CO 2 uptake due to the loss
of vegetation (purple arrows) and the release of globally important GHG emissions.

Fossil CO2 emissions have grown almost continuously for the past two centuries (Figure 4),
a trend only interrupted briefly by globally
significant economic downturns. Emissions
to date continued to grow at 1.6% in 2017 and
at a preliminary 2.0% (1.1%–3.4%) per year in
2018. It is anticipated that a new record high

emissions reached an estimated 41.5 ± 3.0 billion tons of CO2 in 2018.
The continued high emissions have led to high
levels of CO2 accumulation in the atmosphere
that amounted to 2.82 ± 0.09 ppm in22018. 3
This level of atmospheric CO2 is the result of
the accumulation of only a part of the total CO2
emitted because about 55% of all emissions
are removed by CO2 sinks in the oceans and
terrestrial vegetation.
Sinks for CO2 are distributed across the hemispheres, on land and oceans, but CO2 fluxes
in the tropics (30°S–30°N) are close to carbon
neutral due to the CO2 sink being largely offset
by emissions from deforestation. Sinks for
CO2 in the southern hemisphere are dominated by the removal of CO2 by the oceans,
while the stronger sinks in the northern hemisphere have similar contributions from both
land and oceans.

In 2018, south polar stratospheric temperatures were below the long-term mean
(1979–2017), and the stratospheric polar vortex was relatively stable with less eddy heat
flux than the average from June to mid-November. Ozone depletion started relatively
early in 2018 and remained above the longterm average until about mid-November
(Figure 5).
The ozone hole area reached its maximum for
2018 on 20 September, with 24.8 million km2,
whereas it reached 28.2 million km 2 on
2 October in 2015 and 29.6 million km2 on
24 September 2006 according to an analysis
from NASA. Despite a relatively cold and
stable vortex, the 2018 ozone hole was smaller
than in earlier years with similar temperature
conditions, such as, for example, 2006. This
is an indication that the size of the ozone
hole is starting to respond to the decline
in stratospheric chlorine as a result of the
provisions of the Montreal Protocol.

SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURES
Sea-surface waters in a number of ocean
areas were unusually warm in 2018, including
much of the Pacific with the exception of the
eastern tropical Pacific and an area to the
north of Hawaii, where temperatures were
below average. The western Indian Ocean,
tropical Atlantic and an area of the North
Atlantic extending from the east coast of
the United States were also unusually warm.
Unusually cold surface waters were observed
in an area to the south of Greenland, which
is one area of the world that has seen longterm cooling.

(Figure 6). The record high sea-surface temperatures were linked to unusually warm
conditions over New Zealand, which had
its warmest summer and warmest month
(January) on record. It was also the warmest
November to January period on record for
Tasmania. The warm waters were associated
with high humidity and February, though past
the peak of the marine heatwave, saw a number of extreme rainfall events in New Zealand.

OCEAN HEAT CONTENT
More than 90% of the energy trapped by
GHGs goes into the oceans and ocean heat
content provides a direct measure of this
energy accumulation in the upper layers of the
ocean. Unlike surface temperatures, where
the incremental long-term increase from one
year to the next is typically smaller than the
year-to-year variability caused by El Niño and
La Niña, ocean heat content is rising more

Both observations and numerical models indicate
that oxygen is declining in the modern open and
coastal oceans, including estuaries and semi-enclosed seas. Since the middle of the last century,
there has been an estimated 1%–2% decrease
(that is, 2.4–4.8 Pmol or 77 billion–145 billion
tons) in the global ocean oxygen inventory,1, 2
while, in the coastal zone, many hundreds of sites
are known to have experienced oxygen concentrations that impair biological processes or are
lethal for many organisms. Regions with historically low oxygen concentrations are expanding,
and new regions are now exhibiting low oxygen
conditions. While the relative importance of
the various mechanisms responsible for the
loss of the global ocean oxygen content is not
precisely known, global warming is expected
to contribute to this decrease directly because
the solubility of oxygen decreases in warmer
waters, and indirectly through changes in ocean
dynamics that reduce ocean ventilation, which is
the introduction of oxygen to the ocean interior.
Model simulations have been performed for the
end of this century that project a decrease of
oxygen in the open ocean under both high- and
low-emission scenarios.
In coastal areas, increased export by rivers
of nitrogen and phosphorus since the 1950s
has resulted in eutrophication of water bodies
worldwide. Eutrophication increases oxygen
consumption and, when combined with low
ventilation, leads to the occurrence of oxygen deficiencies in subsurface waters. Climate

change is expected to further amplify deoxygenation in coastal areas, already influenced by
anthropogenic nutrient discharges, by decreasing oxygen solubility, reducing ventilation by
strengthening and extending periods of seasonal stratification of the water column, and in
some cases where precipitation is projected to
increase, by increasing nutrient delivery.
The volume of anoxic regions of the ocean oxygen minimum zones has expanded since 1960,2
altering biogeochemical pathways by allowing
processes that consume fixed nitrogen and
release phosphate, iron, hydrogen sulfide (H2S),
and possibly N2O (see figure). The relatively
limited availability of essential elements, such
as nitrogen and phosphorus, means such alterations are capable of perturbing the equilibrium
chemical composition of the oceans. Furthermore, we do not know how positive feedback
loops (for example, remobilization of phosphorus
and iron from sediment particles) may speed
up the perturbation of this equilibrium.
Deoxygenation affects many aspects of the
ecosystem services provided by the world’s
oceans and coastal waters. For example, the
process affects biodiversity and food webs,
and can reduce growth, reproduction and survival of marine organisms. Low-oxygen-related
changes in spatial distributions of harvested
species can cause changes in fishing locations
and practices, and can reduce the profitability of
fisheries. Deoxygenation can also increase the
difficulty of providing sound advice on fishery
management.

The greatest rates of ocean warming are in the
southern ocean, with warming reaching to the
deepest layers. However, there are significant
regional differences. The subpolar surface
ocean south of the Antarctic circumpolar
current (ACC) has exhibited delayed warming,
or even a slight cooling over past decades.1, 2
To the north of the ACC (approximately 30°S
to 60°S), however, the southern ocean has
experienced rapid warming from the surface
to a depth of 2 000 m (see figure) at rates of
roughly twice those of the global ocean. 3, 4, 5
The pattern of delayed warming to the south,
and enhanced surface to intermediate-depth
warming to the north is driven by the northward and downward advection of heat by
the southern ocean meridional overturning
circulation.1, 2 This transfer of heat from the
surface to the interior makes the southern
ocean the primary region of anthropogenic
heat uptake. 6 Indeed, the observed rapid
warming north of the ACC has been formally
attributed to increasing GHG concentrations.3
Changes in the westerly winds, and resulting
anomalous northward Ekman transport of
cold waters, driven by stratospheric ozone
depletion, may also contribute to the subpolar surface cooling7, 8 and warming to the
north. 3 Finally, the deep (> 2 000 m) and
abyssal (> 4 000 m) southern ocean has been
warming significantly faster than the global
mean. 9, 10 This is thought to be connected
to changes in the rate of Antarctic bottom
water formation and the lower limb of the
meridional overturning circulation.

steadily with less pronounced year-to-year
fluctuations (Figure 7). Indeed, 2018 set new
records for ocean heat content in the upper
700 m (data since 1955) and upper 2 000 m
(data since 2005), exceeding previous records
set in 2017.

SEA LEVEL
Sea level is one of the seven key indicators of
global climate change highlighted by GCOS 4
and adopted by WMO for use in characterizing the state of the global climate in its
annual statements. Sea level continues to
rise at an accelerated rate (see Figure 8, left).
Global mean sea level for 2018 was around
3.7 mm higher than in 2017 and the highest
on record. Over the period January 1993 to
December 2018, the average rate of rise was
3.15 ± 0.3 mm yr-1, while the estimated acceleration was 0.1 mm yr-2. Accelerated ice mass
loss from the ice sheets is the main cause
of the global mean sea-level acceleration as

OCEAN ACIDIFICATION
In the past decade, the oceans have absorbed
around 30% of anthropogenic CO 2 emissions. Absorbed CO2 reacts with seawater and
changes ocean pH. This process is known as
ocean acidification. Changes in pH are linked
to shifts in ocean carbonate chemistry that
can affect the ability of marine organisms,
such as molluscs and reef-building corals,
to build and maintain shells and skeletal
material. This makes it particularly important to fully characterize changes in ocean

Assessing the sea-level budget helps to quantify and understand the causes of sea-level
change. Closure of the total sea-level budget
means that the observed changes of global
mean sea level as determined from satellite
altimetry equal the sum of observed contributions from changes in ocean mass and
thermal expansion (based on in situ temperature and salinity data, down to 2 000 m since
2005 with the international Argo project).
Ocean mass change can be either derived
from GRACE satellite gravimetry (since 2002)
or from adding up individual contributions
from glaciers, ice sheets and terrestrial water
storage (Figure 8, right). Failure to close the
sea-level budget would indicate errors in
some of the components or contributions
from components missing from the budget.

carbonate chemistry. Observations in the
open ocean over the last 30 years have shown
a clear trend of decreasing pH (Figure 9). The
IPCC AR5 reported a decrease in the surface
ocean pH of 0.1 units since the start of the
industrial revolution (1750). Trends in coastal
locations, however, are less clear due to the
highly dynamic coastal environment, where
a great many influences such as temperature
changes, freshwater runoff, nutrient influx,
biological activity and large ocean oscillations
affect CO2 levels. To characterize the variability of ocean acidification, and to identify the
drivers and impacts, a high temporal and
spatial resolution of observations is crucial.
In line with previous reports and projections
on ocean acidification, global pH levels continue to decrease. More data for recently
established sites for observations in New
Zealand show similar patterns, while filling
important data gaps for ocean acidification
in the southern hemisphere. Availability of
operational data is currently limited, but it
is expected that the newly introduced methodology for the United Nations Sustainable

Development Goal indicator 14.3.1 (“Average
marine acidity (pH) measured at agreed suite
of representative sampling stations”) will lead
to an expansion in the observation of ocean
acidification on a global scale.

THE CRYOSPHERE
The cryosphere component of the Earth system includes solid precipitation, snow cover,
sea ice, lake and river ice, glaciers, ice caps,
ice sheets, permafrost and seasonally frozen
ground. The cryosphere provides key indicators of climate change, yet is one of the most
under-sampled domains of the Earth system.
There are at least 30 cryospheric properties
that, ideally, would be measured. Many are
measured at the surface, but spatial coverage
is generally poor. Some have been measured
for many years from space; the capability to
measure others with satellites is developing.
The major cryosphere indicators for the state
of the climate include sea ice, glaciers, and the
Greenland ice sheet. Snow cover assessment
is also included in this section.

SEA ICE
Arctic sea-ice extent was well below average throughout 2018 and was at record low
levels for the first two months of the year.
The annual maximum occurred in midMarch and the March monthly extent was
14.48 million km2, approximately 7% below
the 1981–2010 average. This ranked as the
third lowest March extent in the 1979–2018
satellite record, according to data from NSIDC
and the Copernicus Climate Change Service
(C3S). Only March 2016 and 2017 were lower.
Following the below-average maximum
extent, sea-ice extent ranked second lowest
on record to the end of May and continued
to rank among the 10 lowest until the end of
August. Similar to 2017, a strong, persistent
low-pressure system over the Arctic helped to
inhibit ice loss and keep temperatures below
average, especially during late summer. The
Arctic sea-ice extent reached its minimum in
mid-September. The September monthly seaice extent was 5.45 million km2, approximately
28% below average and the sixth smallest
September extent on record (Figure 10, left).
The 12 lowest September extents have all
occurred since 2007. Sea-ice coverage was
particularly low in the East Siberian, northern
Laptev and northern Chukchi Seas. Nearand above-average sea-ice coverage was
observed in the eastern Beaufort Sea and
the northern Kara and Barents Seas.
After the sea-ice minimum in September,
sea-ice extent in the Arctic expanded at a
slower-than-average rate until mid-October

when ice expansion accelerated through to
the end of November. By December the rate
of ice expansion had slowed again and at the
end of 2018 daily ice extent was near record
low levels.
Antarctic sea-ice extent was also well below
average throughout 2018. The monthly extent
in January was the second lowest, and in
February the lowest. The annual minimum
extent occurred in late February and the
monthly average was 2.28 million km2, 33%
below average and ranked record low in the
C3S dataset and second lowest in the NSIDC
data. Late summer sea-ice conditions in the
Antarctic have been highly variable for several years, with the record largest sea-ice
extent occurring as recently as 2008. For the
seven months from February to August, the
monthly extent ranked among the 10 lowest
on record.
The Antarctic sea-ice extent reached its annual
maximum in late September and early October. The September monthly average extent
was 17.82 million km2, 4% below average and
the second smallest on record according to
the C3S dataset, and fifth smallest according
to the NSIDC data (Figure 10, right). Belowaverage ice coverage was observed in parts
of the northern Weddell Sea and southern
Indian Ocean. After the maximum extent in
early spring, Antarctic sea ice declined at a
rapid rate with the monthly extents ranking
among the five lowest for each month through
to the end of 2018. In the last days of 2018,
the daily Antarctic sea-ice extent reached a
record minimum.

Antarctic ice sheet mass balance
1979–1989

Eric Rignot,1 Michael Sparrow 2

Laboratory, California Institute of Technology

2

WMO

Antarctica contains an ice volume that translates into a sea-level equivalent of 57.2 m.1
Its annual net input of mass from snowfall
is 2 100 Gt, excluding ice shelves, equivalent to a 5.8 mm fluctuation in global sea
level. 2 In a state of mass equilibrium, accumulation of snowfall in the interior would
balance surface ablation (wind transport and
sublimation) and ice discharge along the
periphery into the southern ocean. Nearly
half of the land ice that crosses the grounding line to reach the ocean to form floating
ice shelves melts in contact with the ocean,
while the other half breaks up and detaches
into icebergs. 3,4
Recent observations have shown that the
ice sheet is losing mass along the periphery
due to the enhanced flow of its glaciers at a
rate that has been increasing over time, while
there is no long-term change in snowfall accumulation in the interior. Recent research5 has
evaluated the mass balance of the Antarctic
ice sheet over the last four decades using a
comprehensive, precise satellite record and
output products from a regional atmospheric
climate model to document its impact on
sea-level rise. The mass loss is dominated by
enhanced glacier flow in areas closest to warm,
salty, subsurface circumpolar deep water,
including east Antarctica, which has been a
major contributor over the entire period. The
same sectors are likely to dominate sea-level
rise from Antarctica in decades to come as
enhanced polar westerlies push more circumpolar deep water (CDW) towards the glaciers.
The total mass loss from Antarctica increased
from 40 ± 9 Gt/year in the 11-year period
1979 –1989 to 50 ± 14 Gt /year in 1989 –
1999, 166 ± 18 Gt/year in 1999–2009, and
252 ± 26 Gt/year in 2009–2017, that is, by a
factor 6 (see figure).
This evolution of the glaciers and surrounding
ice shelves is consistent with a strengthening
of the westerlies caused by a rise in GHG levels
and ozone depletion that bring more CDW onto
the continental shelf. Enhanced intrusion of
CDW being the root cause of the mass loss in
the Amundsen Sea Embayment and the West

to CDW and could contribute a multimetre

GREENLAND
The Greenland ice sheet has been losing ice
mass nearly every year over the past two
decades. The surface mass budget (SMB)
is a preliminary estimate of the surface-ice
changes and includes components that add
to the surface ice, including precipitation
and components that account for ice loss
such as meltwater runoff, evaporation and
wind removal. The final ice mass balance
calculation will also include loss of ice by ice
flow and calving into the ocean. These are
not included in the SMB, however, causing
the SMB to be higher than the total eventual
change in mass.
In 2018, similarly to 2017, the SMB saw an
increase due to above-average snow fall,
particularly in eastern Greenland, and a
near-average melt season. Despite cool and
snowy summer conditions, three surface
melt events occurred in July and August,
with more than 30% of the ice sheet surface
experiencing melting during each event.
About 150 gigatons more ice mass will be
added to the ice sheet compared to the
1981–2010 average, the sixth highest value
in the 1960–2018 period of record. This is
the largest SMB net gain since 1996, and
the highest snow fall since 1972. Despite the
gain in overall SMB in 2017 and 2018, it is
only a small departure from the trend over
the past two decades, which has witnessed
the loss from the Greenland ice sheet of
approximately 3 600 gigatons of ice mass
since 2002. A recent study also examined ice
cores taken from Greenland, which captured
melting events back to the mid-1500s. The
study determined that the recent level of melt

The World Glacier Monitoring Service monitors glacier mass balance using a set of
global reference glaciers having more than
30 years of observations between 1950 and
2018. They cover 19 mountain regions. Preliminary results for 2018, based on a subset
of glaciers, indicate that the hydrological year
2017/18 was the thirty-first consecutive year of
negative mass balance, with a mass balance
of -0.7 m water equivalent (Figure 11). The
cumulative loss of ice since 1970 amounts to
21.1 m water equivalent.6
A hot summer in parts of Europe, including record heat in some locations, caused
massive ice losses for many alpine glaciers.
Heavy snow during the 2017/18 winter season
helped to partially protect the glaciers from
the summer heat. In April and May, record
high snow depths were measured on many
Swiss glaciers. However, very little snow
fell during the warm summer months and,
combined with the third hottest summer on
record for Switzerland, the country’s glaciers
lost an average of 1.5–2.0 metres of ice thickness. According to the Expert Commission for
Cryospheric Measurement Networks of the
Academy of Sciences, Swiss glaciers have lost
one fifth of their volume in the last 10 years.

SNOW COVER
During 2018, the average northern hemisphere
snow cover extent was 25.64 million km2. This
was 0.77 million km2 greater than the 1981–2010
average and ranked as the thirteenth largest annual snow cover extent since satellite
records began in November 1966 and slightly
below 2017. Above-average snow cover was
observed for most months, with below-average snow cover during the late spring and
summer. Continental snow cover anomalies
across North America were generally greater
than snow cover anomalies for Eurasia.
6

This represents the depth of water that would result by
distributing the water in liquid form obtained from the snow
and ice lost over the last 48 years evenly across the area of
the glaciers. This would give a column of water 21.1 m deep
over every m 2 of glacier.

There are no comparable snow-cover records
for the southern hemisphere, where (except
for the Antarctic) snow is generally rare over
land outside of high mountain regions. In
the high elevations of New South Wales and
parts of Victoria in Australia, the snow season
started early compared to recent years, with
heavy snow falling in mid-June. In Spencers
Creek, New South Wales, 73.6 cm of snow was
recorded over 5 days in June, resulting in the
highest snow depth since 2000 that early in the
season. Numerous cold fronts and below-average temperatures impacted the region for the
rest of the winter season with nearly steady
snow accumulation. Snow continued to fall
on the higher elevations of New South Wales
mountains with the snow depth peaking at
224.6 cm at Spencers Creek in late August, a
little less than the 240.9-cm peak observed in
September 2017. The peak snow depth was
above the long-term average of 190 cm.

DRIVERS OF INTERANNUAL
VARIABILITY
Certain recurrent and dominant patterns
have been identified from historical records
of pressure and sea-surface temperature.
These are often referred to as “modes” of
variability and describe or influence conditions over large areas of the world from
seasons to years and beyond.
The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is
one of the most important drivers of yearto-year variability in global weather patterns
as well as global temperature. The Pacific
Ocean also has a global effect on longer time
scales through the Pacific Decadal Oscillation
(PDO). The Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), which is
related to changes in the sea-surface temperature gradient across the Indian Ocean, affects
weather around the ocean basin as well as
the Asian monsoon. In the North Atlantic,
slow changes in sea-surface temperature,
referred to as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, have an effect on basin-wide climate,
including hurricane formation. The Arctic
Oscillation (AO) and North Atlantic Oscillation
(NAO) are closely related modes, representing
atmospheric circulation patterns at mid- to
high latitudes of the northern hemisphere. In
the positive phases of these modes, westerly
circulation is strengthened at mid-latitudes.

The negative mode is associated with a weakening of the circulation. Changes in AO and
NAO are seen on all time scales from days to
decades. In the southern hemisphere, there
is an equivalent mode known as the Antarctic
Oscillation (AAO), often referred to as the
Southern Annular Mode (SAM).
The year 2018 started with a weak La Niña
event, with cooler than average surface waters
in the tropical Pacific. The La Niña continued
until March when temperatures returned to
near normal. Late in the year, sea-surface
temperatures in the eastern tropical Pacific
warmed, showing signs of a return to El Niño.
The atmosphere did not respond in a way that
was characteristic of El Niño, however, and the
feedbacks that mark a mature El Niño – such
as weakened Pacific trade winds, increased
cloudiness at the date line and a weakening of
the pressure gradient across the Pacific – were
absent. Although there was a weak imprint of
La Niña on annual average temperatures in
the Pacific, typical patterns of precipitation
associated with ENSO variability, either La
Niña or El Niño, were not clearly evident in
2018 (see section on Precipitation).
From the late 1990s until around 2014 PDO
was in a predominately negative phase. This
negative phase has been invoked to explain
the temporary reduction in the rate of surface
warming, while heat continued to accumulate
at a steady rate in the oceans. Throughout
2015 and 2016, PDO was positive, but in 2018
it was predominantly negative again. On
short time scales it is difficult to distinguish
between the effects of ENSO and PDO.
While IOD was predominantly negative during
the first half of 2018, it shifted to the positive
phase from September to December. During
the austral spring months, a positive IOD
index is linked with drier conditions in central
and southern Australia.
In 2018, the monthly NAO was strongly
positive, with the exception of March and
November. In winter, a positive NAO is generally associated with warm and wet conditions
across northern Europe and drier, cooler conditions further south. A negative NAO is often
associated with drier and colder conditions
across northern Europe. In March, a period of
cold weather affected an area from the United

PRECIPITATION

The longest periods of CWD occur in the
Indian monsoon and in the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) across South America
and the Malay Archipelago. Regions with
heavy precipitation days (> 20 mm daily precipitation) are related to the ITCZ as well as
the African and Indian monsoons, but also to
tropical storm activities and on the windward
slope of mid-latitude coastal mountains.
These are, on average, also the regions with
the highest RX5 (Figure 12, right). More than
300 mm was recorded locally over 5 days in
Afghanistan, reflecting a series of events in
May with intense rainfall causing flash floods
and associated fatalities.

Although weak La Niña conditions were present at the beginning of 2018, later changing
to neutral, the usual effects on precipitation
were absent. For example, several floods
occurred in California, where the opposite
is expected during La Niña events.
Unlike other important climate variables,
there is no single indicator that can usefully
summarize global precipitation changes.
Indeed, some of the predicted changes in
precipitation in response to climate change
affect the frequency and intensity of rainfall
that are not well captured by simple monthly

or annual averages. A number of indices have
been developed that provide this additional
information. One such measure is “consecutive wet days” (CWDs), which gives the
longest spell of such CWDs in a given period
(Figure 12). Another is “RX5”, which captures
the highest 5-day rainfall total.

In 2018 large positive precipitation anomalies
with respect to a 1951–2010 climatology, in
some places above the 90 th percentile, were
observed in some regions in northern and
eastern Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, central
and south-east Asia and the Malay Archipelago, south-western Australia, New Zealand
and eastern North America (Figure 13).
Above-average precipitation amounts were
also observed in Japan, south-west and
south-east Europe, some spots in South
America and the previously noted event in
Afghanistan. Above-average precipitation
was also observed around the Arctic Ocean.
Below-normal precipitation, partly below the
10th percentile, were found in central and east
Australia, the northern and eastern coast of

the Arabian Sea and north-east of the Caspian
Sea, but also at some spots in Central and
North America and southern Africa. Rainfall deficits were also reported from central
and northern Europe and Argentina. Some
of these regions also experienced belownormal precipitation amounts in 2017, such
as parts of southern Africa, eastern Australia
or northern North America.
The Indian summer monsoon brought less
precipitation than normal to the West Ghats
and the eastern parts of the Himalayas, but
higher than normal precipitation in the Western Himalayas. The all-India rainfall for June
to September 2018 was around 9% below
the long-term average. The African monsoon
brought higher precipitation than normal to
most regions and extended far into the Sahel
region. However, a region between Senegal
and Cote d’Ivoire received less than normal
precipitation.
Noteworthy events related to heavy precipitation or continuous rainfall occurred in the
region between Lake Victoria and the Ethiopian
Highlands; the eastern and northern coast of
the Bay of Bengal to the eastern parts of the
Himalayas due to the Indian summer monsoon; and south-east Asia due to repeated
occurrence of tropical storms. The northern
Mediterranean region experienced many heavy
precipitation events. Several flash floods were
caused by repeated heavy precipitation events
in the Middle East. In Argentina, some regions
experienced drought conditions while at the
same time others had flash floods. Flooding
affected central Europe at the beginning of the
year, but the same region experienced severe
dry conditions later on. In Iceland, Reykjavík
had a very wet year, with 261 rain days, the
highest on record. The month of May was
the wettest on record, at three times the May
average, and it rained every single day of the
month. In November, the city had its highest
ever 2-day rainfall total, with 83.2 mm.

all four northern hemisphere basins. There
were 74 northern hemisphere cyclones in
2018, well above the long-term average of 63.
The north-east Pacific basin was especially
active, with an accumulated cyclone energy
(ACE)7 value of 316 kt 2 , the highest since
reliable satellite records began (Figure 14).
Southern hemisphere activity in the 2017/18
season was near average, with 22 cyclones.

Two of the strongest tropical cyclones of
the year were Mangkhut (Ompong) and Yutu
(Rosita) in the north-west Pacific. Mangkhut
(Ompong) crossed the northern Philippines
in mid-September, then passed just south
of Hong Kong, China before making landfall
in Guangdong province of China. It affected
more than 2.4 million people. According to
the Philippines Department of Agriculture,
over 550 000 hectares of agricultural land
were affected, and agricultural losses were
high. Reported deaths stood at 134, 127 of
them in the Philippines. In Hong Kong, China,
the storm surge of 2.35 m at Victoria Harbour
was the highest on record. Yutu (Rosita),
which crossed the northern Mariana Islands
in October at near peak intensity, caused
extensive damage in that region.
Jebi, which made landfall near Kobe on
4 September, was the strongest landfall in
Japan since 1993. There was widespread
river and storm-surge flooding, with much
of Kansai International Airport (near Osaka)

being inundated. Son-Tinh, in July, caused
extensive flooding in Viet Nam and also in
the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, where
it contributed to the collapse of a dam which
resulted in at least 55 deaths. Soulik, in late
August, crossed the Korean Peninsula and
contributed to severe flooding in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea in which
at least 86 lives were lost. At the end of the
year, tropical depression Usman hit the central
Philippines on 29 December, with heavy rain
and landslides.
There were two significant hurricane landfalls
on the United States mainland in 2018, with
combined damages estimated to be around
US$ 49 billion. Florence weakened from
category 4 to category 1 before landfall in
North Carolina in September, but still caused
extreme rainfall and significant flooding, especially in coastal regions. Michael, in October,
made landfall at Mexico Beach, Florida, as
a category 4 system with a central pressure
of 919 hPa (provisional estimate), the most
intense known landfall in this region and the
most intense landfall in the continental United
States since at least 1992, with severe wind
and storm-surge damage. At least 53 deaths
in the United States were associated with
Florence and 49 with Michael.

Three east and central Pacific hurricanes
reached category 5 intensity in 2018: Lane,
Walaka and Willa. The most significant
impacts came from Lane, which approached
Hawaii (although at well below peak intensity) and caused extremely heavy rainfall;
1 321 mm of rain was recorded in 96 hours
during the period 22–26 August at Mountain
View, on the island of Hawaii, the highest
storm rainfall total on record for a Hawaiian
tropical cyclone, and second for the United
States after Harvey in 2017. Earlier in the year,
in an event not associated with a tropical
cyclone, Hanalei, on the north coast of Kauai,
received 1 262 mm in 24 hours on 14–15 April,
a new United States record.
Three of the five northern Indian Ocean
cyclones affected Yemen: Sagar and Mekunu
in May, and Luban in October. The most
intense of these was Mekunu, which made
landfall near Salalah, Oman in late May. At
least 24 people died, most on the island of
Socotra. Titli made landfall on 11 October in
Andhra Pradesh, on the east coast of India,
and there were at least 85 deaths, mostly
from flooding.

close to the coast and were associated with
major flooding, with significant loss of life in
both cases. Extremely heavy rainfall associated with tropical cyclones also occurred
at times in early 2018 on La Réunion, with a
daily total of 847.5 mm at Grand-Coude on
18 January during Tropical Cyclone Berguitta,
and an hourly total of 176 mm at Sainte-Rose
on 24 April during Tropical Cyclone Fakir; the
latter is the highest hourly total observed at
an automatic site in the territory.
Gita in the South Pacific in February 2018
was the most intense tropical cyclone ever
to affect Tonga, passing 30 km south of the
most heavily populated island of Tongatapu.
It was the costliest storm in Tonga’s history.
Significant damage also occurred in Samoa,
American Samoa and on outlying islands
of Fiji.

FLOODING, EXTREME RAINFALL AND
EXTRATROPICAL STORMS
In August, the south-west Indian state of
Kerala suffered major flooding, reportedly
the worst since 1924, as a result of persistent
heavy monsoon rains. Rainfall for the state
for August was 96% above the long-term
average, with weekly totals for the weeks
9–15 and 16–22 August of 258% and 218%
above average, respectively. At Nilambar
400 mm fell on 9 August, and 620 mm
in 2 days at Peermade on 15–16 August.
Reported deaths stood at 223, and according
to reports from the National Disaster Management Authority more than 1.4 million people
were accommodated in relief camps and
more than 5.4 million were affected in some
way. Total economic losses were estimated
at US$ 4.3 billion.
Large parts of western Japan experienced
destructive flooding in late June and early
July as a result of persistent rains from a
near-stationary baiu front. Rainfall totals at
Yanase, on Shikoku island, reached 1 025 mm
in 48 hours at the system’s peak, with a total
of 1 853 mm for the period from 28 June
to 8 July. In total, at least 245 deaths were
reported and 6 767 houses were destroyed.
There was major flooding on parts of the
Niger River and its tributaries in September,

particularly in northern and central Nigeria
and the Niger, driven by heavy rains from
late August onwards. Flood peaks were generally lower than those observed in 2012
but impacts were still very substantial, with
200 deaths reported and 561 000 people
internally displaced.
Flooding affected many parts of east Africa
in March and April. This included Kenya and
Somalia, which had previously been suffering
from severe drought, as well as Ethiopia and
northern and central regions of the United
Republic of Tanzania. Rainfall for the period
from March to May was at least double the
average over most of Kenya and northern
parts of the United Republic of Tanzania – at
least 87 deaths were attributed to flooding
in the former and 14 in the latter.
Heavy rain and flash flooding affected various
parts of the Middle East in late October and
November. Noteworthy falls included 84 mm
in 6 hours at Abu Hamor, Qatar, on 20 October,
102.8 mm in 24 hours at Al Fujairah, United
Arab Emirates, on 28 October, and 49.2 mm
in 24 hours at Kuwait Airport on 9 November.
Flash floods with loss of life were reported in
Jordan in late October and on 9–10 November,
and in Iraq from 2 to 25 November.

HEATWAVES AND DROUGHT
Large parts of Europe experienced exceptional heat and drought through the late
spring and summer of 2018. Temperatures
were well above average and rainfall well
below average from April onwards in much
of northern and western Europe.
Some of the most abnormal conditions
affected northern Europe from May to July.
This period was the driest and warmest on
record in many parts of central and southern
Scandinavia and Finland; rainfall for May
to July at Lund in southern Sweden, with
observations dating back to 1748, was only
about half the previous lowest recorded.
Denmark had its hottest summer and driest
May to July on record, and Norway and Finland their hottest Julys. This culminated in
a prolonged heatwave in late July and early
August, which included numerous record
high temperatures north of the Arctic Circle,
and record long runs of warm temperatures,

including 25 consecutive days above 25 °C at
Helsinki-Vantaa, Finland, and 8 consecutive
days above 30 °C at Lääne-Nigula, Estonia.
Warm nights and high humidity were also a
feature of this period, with records including
seven consecutive nights above 20 °C at Riga,
Latvia, and a national record dewpoint of
24.8 °C on 1 August at Karlskrona, Sweden.
It was also an exceptionally warm and dry
period in the United Kingdom and Ireland.
Conditions in these regions moderated from
mid-August, but it remained unusually warm
and dry further south. Dry conditions were
especially persistent in Germany, where the
April–September period was the second driest on record, leading to heavy agricultural
production losses , and eastern Switzerland
(driest April to November on record), with
western Poland, Czechia (with its driest January to August on record), the Netherlands
and north-eastern France also amongst the
areas affected. Latvia went on to have its
driest year on record (29% below average)
and Czechia its second driest (24% below
average), while further north, Stockholm
had its driest year since 1892. Uccle (near
Brussels) had its second-driest year on record
(25% below average).
The most significant heatwave in central
Europe was in late July and early August;
in France it was of similar duration to the

26

heatwave of 2003 but less intense; still,
1 500 excess deaths were repor ted. In
Germany, some sites in the Frankfurt area
had 18 consecutive days above 30 °C from
23 July to 9 August. Further south-west, a
short but intense heatwave affected Spain
and Portugal in early August. In Portugal,
4 August was the country’s hottest day of
the 21st century with 40% of stations setting
records, including Lisbon – Gago Coutinho
(44.0 °C). Armenia had its warmest July with
43.7 °C being recorded in Yerevan, the highest
temperature on record.
Wildfires reached an unprecedented extent in
Sweden, with over 25 000 hectares burned,
and abnormal wildfire activity also occurred
in Latvia, Norway, Germany, the United Kingdom and Ireland. The dry conditions also led
to very low flows on some central European
rivers, with the Rhine approaching record low
flows by mid-October, before some recovery
during December. This severely disrupted
river transport with the weight of goods carried reduced by 20% to 25% compared with
2017. There were also disruptions to river
transport on the Danube in Serbia.
Eastern Australia experienced significant
drought during 2018. The most extensively
affected area was inland eastern Australia,
particularly in New South Wales and southern Queensland, with much of the region
receiving less than half its average rainfall
for the period from January to September.
Over the Murray-Darling Basin, the rainfall
for January to September was the lowest
since 1902. The abnormally dry conditions
also extended to coastal areas in eastern
Victoria, where it was the second dry year
in succession, and on the east coast around
and south of Sydney. In much of southern
inland Queensland, as well as north-west Victoria and southern inland New South Wales,
rainfall has been below average for most of
the period since early 2012, interrupted only
briefly by heavy rains in winter and spring
2016. Central Australia was dry even by its
usual standards, with Alice Springs having a record 160 consecutive days without
rain. The dry conditions extended to parts
of Indonesia in mid-year, with significant
drought affecting Java from July to October
before a return to near-average rainfall from
November.

Afghanistan was significantly affected by
drought, with low rainfall early in the year
having a substantial impact on crop planting, although heavy rains affected parts of
the country in May. Long-term drought also
persists in western Pakistan, with rainfall in
Baluchistan at least 28% below average in
each of the five years from 2014 to 2018. The
year 2018 was especially dry at 62% below
average, the fourth-driest year since regional
records began in 1961. Drought conditions
were also reported in parts of Iran.
Severe drought affected Uruguay, and northern and central Argentina, in late 2017 and
early 2018, with the most intense period
lasting from October 2017 to March 2018.
Rainfall for the 6-month period over the five
most affected Argentine provinces (Entre
Ríos, Santa Fe, Córdoba, Buenos Aires and
La Pampa) was 43% below the 1981–2010
average, the lowest on record, while individual
locations that had their driest October–March
on record included Buenos Aires (364.7 mm)
and Córdoba (329.2 mm). The drought eased
by April, and May was Argentina’s wettest
on record. The dry conditions resulted in
heavy losses to summer crops, especially
soybeans and maize, with agricultural losses
estimated at US$ 5.9 billion. Later in the year,
a dry December contributed to estimated
losses of 30% to soybean crops in Paraná
state in Brazil.
A historically significant heatwave affected
parts of east Asia in late July and early August.
The worst-hit area was Japan, following on
from the severe floods experienced earlier
in the month. A national record of 41.1 °C
was set at Kumagaya on 23 July. In total,
153 deaths in Japan were attributed to the
heat. It was the hottest summer on record
for eastern Japan. The Korean Peninsula
was also seriously affected, with a national
record also set for the Republic of Korea
(41.0 °C at Hongcheon on 1 August), as well
as a city record for Seoul (39.6 °C), and heat
illness and agricultural losses reported in
the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.
Heatwaves affected North America during
the summer of 2018. The most significant
impact was in eastern Canada, which experienced the longest and most intense heat
spell in years. Temperatures exceeding 35 °C,

combined with dewpoints between 20 °C and
25 °C, affected Montreal in early July, with
extreme conditions also occurring through
other parts of southern Quebec and eastern
Ontario. Montreal had a record 5 consecutive days of 33 °C or above. Across Quebec,
86 excess deaths were associated with the
heatwave.8 Later in the summer, Calgary had
its hottest day on record when it reached 36.5
°C on 10 August.
Exceptionally high temperatures occurred
in many parts of the Middle East and North
Africa in late June and early July. On 26 June,
the overnight temperature at Quriyat, Oman,
only fell to 42.6 °C, amongst the highest
known minimum temperatures globally. In
early July the heat extended to north Africa,
with records set at a number of locations in
Algeria, the highest being 51.3 °C at Ouargla,
a national record.

COLD AND SNOW
One of the most significant cold outbreaks in
recent years affected Europe in late February
and early March. Cold conditions initially
became established in north-east Europe
in late February, where the 21–28 February
period was the second coldest on record for
Estonia. Ireland and southern France experienced abnormal snow, with falls of 15 to
30 cm around Nimes and Montpellier, and
in southern Italy around Naples, while snow
depths exceeding 50 cm were reported at
some locations in eastern Ireland. Unusually
heavy snow also fell at higher elevations
in Algeria. A rare freezing rain event also
occurred in Portugal. A maximum temperature of -4.7 °C on 1 March at Tredegar, Wales,
was a United Kingdom record for March.
Earlier in the winter, there were unusual snow
falls in some desert areas of Morocco, with
Zagora receiving its first snow since 1960 on
30 January. Wet conditions during the winter
led to very heavy snow accumulations at
higher elevations of the European Alps, with
Arosa, Switzerland, having 530 cm of snow

for the season, its second-highest seasonal
accumulation of the last 50 years.
In southern Africa, Lesotho received an
unusual snow event in mid-August with
5–30 cm of snow accumulation across the
nation. The highest totals were in the Maluti
Mountains. Heavy snow fell as recently as
2016 in Lesotho, but such snow fall used
to be a more common winter event in the
past, being observed in most winters in the
nineteenth and first half of the twentieth
centuries.
A cold wave in January affected parts of
the Indian subcontinent. Between 3 and
13 January, 135 deaths were attributed to
the cold in Uttar Pradesh.
In South America, two rare snow events
affected different parts of the continent. In
June, a strong cold front brought snow fall
to the central district of Santiago, Chile. The
storm system also brought temperatures
as low as -14 °C to parts of the Plurinational
State of Bolivia, and snow as deep as 40 cm
blanketed large parts of Peru. In August, a
rare snow event affected parts of Uruguay
when a strong cold front moved through
the region bringing snow to south-eastern
parts of the country with graupel (snow with
a fragile coating of ice, sometimes referred
to as soft hail) accumulating in neighbouring
Argentina.

WILDFIRES
Major wildfires affected the region around
Athens on 23 July. The fires spread rapidly
in high winds, unusual for the time of year,
with peak gusts of 124 km/h north of Athens.
At least 99 deaths were attributed to the fires,
the worst loss of life in a wildfire anywhere
in the world since the 2009 Black Saturday
fires in Australia.
In the United States on 8 November a wildfire, driven by severe winds in ongoing dry
conditions, burned through the town of Paradise and surrounding areas in California.
The town was largely destroyed by the fire,
85 deaths were reported, the worst loss of
life in a United States wildfire for more than
100 years, and over 18 000 structures were
destroyed.

28

There were also significant fires in California in July and August. The Mendocino
Complex fire was the largest in California
history, affecting a total area of 185 800
hectares, while the Carr fire caused the loss
of 1 604 structures and 8 lives, and insured
losses of US$ 1.5 billion, with the city of
Redding being the worst affected. It was
also a severe fire season in western Canada.
British Columbia broke its record for the
largest area burned in a fire season for the
second successive year, with a total of 1.35
million hectares burnt. Property losses were
modest given the scale of the fires and no
casualties were reported, but heavy smoke
affected the interior of the province and cities
on the west coast such as Vancouver and
Seattle for extended periods. Total losses
for the 2018 United States wildfire season
were estimated at US$ 24 billion, the largest
on record for any season.

SEVERE STORMS
The most significant European windstorm of
the 2017–18 winter was Friederike (known as
David in France). This low-pressure system,
from 17 to 19 January, crossed Ireland and
the United Kingdom, before passing over the
Netherlands, northern Germany and Poland.
The storm’s most significant impacts were in
Germany. Wind gusts reached 203 km/h at
the Brocken (the highest since 1990) and over
140 km/h at some low-elevation sites. There
were also major impacts in the Netherlands
(Amsterdam Airport was closed) and Belgium.
Thirteen deaths were attributed to the storm.
A storm with tropical-cyclone-like properties crossed the eastern Mediterranean in
late September. In the early stages of the
system there was heavy rain and flash flooding in Tunisia and Libya, with 205 mm rain
in 24 hours at Nabeul, Tunisia. The storm
then intensified as it moved east and made
landfall in western Greece on 29 September,
with pressures as low as 989 hPa, leading to
widespread damage there.
The severe weather season in the United
States had below-average levels of activity – 1 102 tornadoes had been reported by
the end of November, about 10% below the
1991–2010 average. It was the first year since
comprehensive records began in 1950 with

no confirmed tornadoes of enhanced Fujita
scale 4 or 5 intensity. However, destructive
hailstorms affected the Dallas-Fort Worth
region on 6 June, and the Denver-Boulder-Fort
Collins corridor on 18–19 June, resulting in
estimated damages of US$ 1.3 billion and
US$ 2.2 billion, respectively.
An intense low-pressure system in the Mediterranean Sea in late October brought flooding
and high winds to several countries. Italy
was the worst affected. Peak wind gusts
on 29 October included 179 km/h at Monte
Cimone, while a gust of 161 km/h occurred at
Kredarica, Slovenia. Extremely heavy rainfall
also occurred, with 24-hour totals including
406 mm at Casera Pradut in the north-east
alpine foothills, and 308 mm at Cabane in Liguria. Three-day totals in excess of 400 mm also
occurred in southern Switzerland and Austria,
and in western Slovenia, while damaging
winds were also reported in Czechia, Corsica
and southern Poland. Thirty deaths in Italy
were associated with the storm. Other events
with heavy rain and flash flooding affected
various parts of the Mediterranean region
in the later part of 2018, including severe
floods in Languedoc, south-west France, on
13–14 October, with rainfall totals of up to 400
mm in 6 hours reported. At the end of the
year, there were a number of intense rainfall
events in Turkey and Cyprus, including a Turkish national record daily fall of 490.8 mm on
18 December at Ovacik, near Antalya.

ATTRIBUTION OF EXTREME EVENTS
Determining the causal factors, including
anthropogenic forcings, that contributed
to or influenced the probability of extreme
events is an area of ongoing research. Each
year since 2012, a selection of peer-reviewed
articles has been published as a supplement
to the Bulletin of the American Meteorological
Society under the title “Explaining Extreme
Events from a Climate Perspective”. The most

recent issue, “Explaining Extreme Events in
2017 from a Climate Perspective”, contains
18 analyses of extreme events between late
2016 and early 2018.
In heat-related events, such as the European
and Chinese heatwaves of 2017, the early
onset of summer in the Republic of Korea
in 2017 and the Tasman Sea marine heatwave of 2017–2018, anthropogenic factors
were found to have increased the probability
of such events occurring. For hydrological
events, such as droughts and heavy rain,
an anthropogenic increase was noted in
each case, but some studies also gave more
emphasis to the role of internal variability in
these events. One paper looked at two case
studies, the Oroville Dam overspill event in
California and Hurricane Harvey in Texas. It
highlighted the complexity of such events
and suggested ways of providing actionable
attribution information for real-world decision-making contexts.
Care needs to be taken in attempting a synthesis of extreme event attribution studies.
A number of factors influence the process by
which events are selected for study. Amongst
other things, these include: availability of
data and other resources, the visibility of the
event, and the perceived ability of models to
accurately simulate the necessary processes.
One must also be aware that the same factors
that increase the likelihood of certain extreme
events can also reduce the likelihood of others; the absence of extremes also needs to
be considered in a balanced view.
The time required to select events for study,
gather data, perform model runs, analyse the
output, and write and review papers means
that there is often a significant delay between
an event and a peer-reviewed attribution analysis. A number of rapid event attributions have
been performed of events in 2018, but these
have not yet been through the review process.

Countries with high exposure
to climate extremes

Global statistics on economic losses attributed
to disasters in 2018 have not been completed
at the time of writing this publication; available statistics indicate that the highest losses
affected the United States resulting from
two significant hurricane landfalls – Florence
and Michael – with a total loss estimated at
nearly US$ 50 billion; much less than the

AGRICULTURE AND FOOD
SECURITY
Exposure of the agricultural sector to climate
extremes is threatening to reverse gains
made in ending hunger and malnutrition. New
evidence shows a continuing rise in world
hunger after a prolonged decline.11 In 2017,
the number of undernourished people was
estimated to have increased to 821 million.
Severe droughts associated with the strong El
Niño of 2015–2016 and a number of localized
extreme weather and climate events contributed to the recent rise in undernourishment.12
Climate variability and extremes are a key
driver behind the recent rise in global hunger and one of the leading causes of severe
food crises. Hunger is significantly worse in
countries with agricultural systems that are
highly sensitive to rainfall and temperature
variability and severe drought, and where the
livelihood of a high proportion of the population depends on agriculture. The countries
with high exposure to climate extremes have
more than double the number of undernourished people as those without high exposure
(Figure 17).

In 2018, weather and climate events accounted
for most of nearly 62 million people affected
by natural hazards, according to an analysis of 281 events recorded by the Centre
for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED).9 Floods continued to affect the
largest number, amounting to more than 35
million people in 2018. The CRED statistics
also highlight that over 9 million people were
affected by drought worldwide, including in
Kenya, Afghanistan, and Central America, as
well as migration hotspots El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. There are
still some challenges to better quantify these
impacts and their association with particular
categories of hydrometeorological events,
including from the perspective of reporting
on specific Sustainable Development Goal
target indicators and monitoring the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction
(2015–2030). There are recent initiatives and
methodologies that provide the latest data
on the impact of natural disasters and crises on agricultural sectors, combined with
sound analyses.10 However, renewed and
urgent efforts to develop and consolidate
innovative approaches, tools and methods
for characterizing high-impact events and
quantify loss and damage and their linkage
to extreme weather, water and climate events
will ultimately support the global agenda on
disaster risk reduction.

Climate events in 2017 had the biggest impact
on acute food insecurity and malnutrition in
Africa, affecting 59 million people in 24 countries and requiring urgent humanitarian
action.13 Much of the vulnerability to climate
variability is associated with the dryland
farming and pastoral rangeland systems
supporting 70%–80% of the continent’s rural
population.
Globally, 40 countries, of which 31 in Africa,
continue to be in need of external assistance
for food.14 Persisting conflicts together with
climate-induced production declines have
negatively affected food availability. In 2018,
unfavourable weather conditions limited
southern African cereal outputs and heightening food insecurity, while ample rains in
East Africa boosted production prospects
but also resulted in localized flooding that
caused food insecurity. Favourable spring
weather boosted production in North Africa,
while in West Africa, harvests are expected
to revert back to average levels.
In Asia, cereal harvests in 2018 declined to
below-average levels in the Near East15 and
the Commonwealth of Independent States
countries because of rainfall deficits and
conflict. Cereal production in Latin America and the Caribbean in 2018 is estimated
at 248 million tons, 8% below the record
output of 2017. The bulk of the decline is
based on drought-reduced maize harvests
of the main producers in South America,
especially Argentina and Brazil. In central
America and the Caribbean, dry conditions
were less severe than previously expected,
particularly in Guatemala and Nicaragua,
and consequently the aggregate output
contracted by 2%.16

In Somalia, about 2.7 million people were
estimated to be in need of emergency assistance. These were mainly internally displaced
persons (IDPs) and agro-pastoral communities affected by drought between mid-2016
and late 2017.17 In southern Africa, especially in Madagascar, the number of people
affected by food insecurity increased to 1.3
million in southern regions, associated with
dry spells and tropical cyclones that kept
cereal production in 2018 at below-average
levels.18
Typhoon Manghkut (Ompong), which crossed
the Philippines in mid-September, was associated with losses in crops and fisheries
that put the population’s food security at
risk. Disruption to agricultural production
affected the country’s food supply for the
following months, while the loss of livelihood for farmers and fisherfolk during the
September–October harvest worsened the
food insecurity and malnutrition.19

POPULATION DISPLACEMENT AND
HUMAN MOBILITY
Out of the 17.7 million IDPs tracked by the IOM
Displacement Tracking Matrix (IOM DTM), 20
over 2 million people were displaced due to
disasters linked to weather and climate events
as at September 2018.21 Drought, floods and
storms (including hurricanes and cyclones)
were the events that led to the greatest number of disaster-induced displacement in 2018.
In all cases, the displaced populations have
protection needs and vulnerabilities.

The IOM DTM is a system to track and monitor displacement
and population mobility. It represents the largest source of
primary data on internal displacement in the world and it
is used by a large number of humanitarian actors in their
operations to support an enhanced response to affected
populations. See https://displacement.iom.int/.

In Madagascar, a long process of interlinked
climate events is leading to population displacements. 22 Out of around 5 700 IDPs
tracked by IOM in the 10 southern communes
between 2009 and 2018, 42% were displaced
in connection with drought as at August
2018. The largest displacements in the
assessed communes were noted between
2013 and 2016, a period corresponding to
the prolonged drought between 2015 and
2016. The number of displaced persons
decreased significantly in 2017 in a period
of improved rains and humanitarian assistance in the region. Early displacements
were tracked in Madagascar in 2018 due to
the lack of rain during the crop cycle from
December 2017 to May 2018. In addition to
drought, which largely affected the south of
Madagascar, over 250 000 IDPs were tracked
in 2017 because of Cyclone Enawo.
In some parts of the world, human mobility
can be understood in the context of the nexus
between conflict and climate events, where
climate events act as a “threat multiplier”.
Somalia is one such context.23 In 2018, a combination of sudden and slow-onset events
compounded by the protracted conflict have
led to continued population displacement
both internally and across borders. 24 As at
December 2018 there were an estimated
1.1 million people in protracted internal displacement in Somalia against a backdrop of
multifaceted conflicts and intensified competition for resources due to climate-related
events. 25 According to the UNHCR Protection and Return Monitoring Network, some
883 000 new internal displacements were
recorded between January and December
2018, with conflict the primary reason for
displacement (36%), followed by flooding

contaminated drinking water leading to rising
cases of “acute watery diarrhoea” and cholera.27 During the same period in 2017, the vast
majority of IDPs (79%) cited drought-related
reasons for their displacement, compared
to only 0.6% indicating flooding.
Existing refugee and IDP sites can be particularly vulnerable to climate and weather
events such as storms. In 2018, hundreds
of thousands of Rohingya refugees were
affected by secondary displacement due to
extreme weather events. 28, 29 The monsoon
rains in Bangladesh between May and September put these refugees at heightened risk
of landslides and flooding, particularly in
Cox’s Bazaar district, where the majority of
Rohingya refugees reside. As at September
2018, up to 200 000 of the total estimated 900
000 Rohingya refugees were exposed to these
natural hazards. UNHCR provided emergency
shelter and made temporary emergency
relocation arrangements for those most at
risk, as well as extending its support to Bangladeshi communities affected by monsoon
rains through the distribution of family kits.30

Between 2000 and 2016, the number of people exposed to heatwaves 31 was estimated
to have increased by around 125 million
(Figure 18), as the average length of individual
heatwaves was 0.37 days longer, compared
to the period between 1986 and 2008. In
2015 alone, a record 175 million people were
exposed to 627 heatwaves. Each event at the
local level translates to significant and varied
impacts; for example, in Karachi, Pakistan,
this same year, 65 000 people were taken to
hospital with heat-related symptoms.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
In addition to direct socioeconomic impacts
on human health and well-being, United
Nations organizations are also tracking environmental impacts associated with climate
change.32 These include coral bleaching and
reduced levels of oxygen in the oceans. Others – loss of “blue carbon” associated with
coastal ecosystems such as mangroves, seagrasses and salt marshes; and ecosystems
across a range of landscapes – are important
coastal, ocean and terrestrial components of
the carbon cycle.
Peatlands are important to human societies
around the world. They contribute significantly to climate change mitigation and
adaptation through carbon sequestration
and storage, biodiversity conservation, water
regime and quality regulation, and the provision of other ecosystem services that support
livelihoods. Climate change has emerged as
a significant threat to peatland ecosystems,
because it exacerbates the effects of drainage
and increases fire risk. It exposes peatlands
currently protected by permafrost to thawing and possible increased CH4 emissions
and loss of carbon. Sea-level rise increases
the risks of coastal erosion and salination of
freshwater peatlands.

31

A heatwave is defined as a period of more than 3 days during
which the minimum temperature is greater than the 99th
percentile of the historical minima (1986–2008 average) (from

Grazing lands cover 5 billion hectares worldwide and sequester 200–500 kg of carbon per
hectare per year, playing an important role
in climate change mitigation. In addition to
containing the bulk of the world’s terrestrial
inorganic carbon, rangelands store organic
carbon in biomass and in the soil. The unique
climatic features of rangelands means that
in many places the majority of carbon is
below ground. Restored rangeland not only
contributes to climate change mitigation, but
provides other ecosystem services, including
protection of watersheds, habitat for biodiversity and reduction of dust storms.

Heat stress is a serious health threat for
humans. Heat is a leading cause of weather-related death, and can exacerbate underlying
morbidities including cardiovascular disease,
diabetes, psychological distress, asthma, as
well as increasing the risk of accidents and
infectious diseases. Analyses conducted
across all six populated continents in recent
years clearly demonstrate that high outdoor
and indoor temperatures have an impact on
mortality.1 For example, daily mortality spikes
can be clearly observed for the heatwave days
that occurred in England during the summer
of 2016 (see figure). 2 Single heatwaves can
last weeks, occur consecutively and result in
significant excess mortality. In 2003, 70 000
people in Europe died as a result of the June–
September event. 3 In 2010, 55 000 excess
deaths occurred during a 44-day heatwave
in the Russian Federation.4, 5

heatstroke and hyperthermia. Heat gain in the
human body can be a combination of external heat from the environment and internal
body heat generated from physical activity
– hence, people working outside are particularly at risk and may not have the option to
stop working or have access to appropriate
cooling opportunities. High temperatures can
also amplify a wide range of existing health
conditions leading to a risk of premature
mortality or additional hospital admissions.
Heatwaves can also affect health indirectly, by
altering human behaviour, the transmission
of diseases, the capacity for health service
delivery, air quality, and the functioning of
critical social infrastructure such as energy,
transport and water. The scale and nature of
negative health impacts of heat depend on the
timing, intensity and duration of a temperature event, and how well adapted buildings
and behaviour are to the prevailing climate.
The precise threshold at which temperature
represents a hazardous condition varies by
region and over time.

TYPES OF IMPACTS
Heat stress ranks amongst the highest environmental threats to human health due to
the combination of direct deaths and derived
effects on vulnerable groups during heatwaves
and prolonged seasonal heat. Heatwaves
can acutely impact large populations for
short periods of time, often triggering health
emergencies that result in excess mortality,
cascading socioeconomic impacts (for example, lost work capacity and labour productivity)
and the loss of health service delivery capacity.
Power shortages that often accompany heatwaves can disrupt health facilities, energy,
transport and water infrastructure, triggering
secondary health risks due to lack of access to
essential services. For example, in Australia
and the United States, tens of thousands were
left without power during heatwaves in 2018 as
energy demand for cooling exceeded electric
grid capacity.6 Heatwaves can increase the risk
of wildfires, amplifying safety and health risks,
such as observed in fires in 2018 in Scandinavia
and California, and in the Russian Federation

in 2010. Extended periods of high day and
night-time temperatures create cumulative
physiological stress on the human body that
exacerbates the top causes of death globally,
including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, and renal disease.
Indoor and outdoor workers are particularly
exposed to chronic excessive heat exposure,
and rising temperatures often make work intolerable or dangerous.7 Occupational heat strain
directly affects workers’ health, elevating the
risk of kidney diseases and work accidents.
The socioeconomic effects of lost productivity
must also be taken into account – considering
individual ability to live healthy and productive
lives is fundamental to poverty reduction and
global health.

INCREASING HEAT EXPOSURE DUE TO
CLIMATE CHANGE
No population can avoid exposure to rising ambient temperatures. However, some
populations are more exposed to or more
physiologically or socioeconomically vulnerable to physiological stress, exacerbated
illness and an increased risk of death from
exposure to excess heat. These include the
elderly, infants and children, pregnant women,
workers, athletes and people involved in
outdoor recreation (for example, religious
events or music festivals), and the poor. In

Mean CET

December 2018, experts from six continents
reported to the Global Heat Health Information Network (GHHIN) significant observed
shifts in regional climatologies, with a strong
trend toward increasing frequency, intensity,
and duration of heat events, accompanied by
wide-ranging health impacts.8
Population exposure to heat is predictably
increasing due to the “climate commitment”
or expected amount of warming due to GHG
levels in the atmosphere today. Heat-related
problems for society will be exacerbated by
a warming climate for the remainder of the
twenty-first century regardless of climate
change mitigation pathways. These trends
raise alarm bells for the public health community as extreme temperature events are
observed to be increasing in their intensity,
frequency and duration.
Detrimental health outcomes associated with
excessive heat exposure can be markedly
reduced if appropriate early warning systems,
public preparedness and health interventions
are effectively implemented. For example, in
Europe the presence of a heat health warning system has been shown to reduce the
impact of heatwaves on several populations.
GHHIN was established in 2018 to increase
collaboration between relevant disciplines to
accelerate the sharing of scientific evidence
and decision tools to improve global public
health heat risk management.8

Air pollution and climate change
processes. The second figure, below, depicts
the complexity of these interactions.

Oksana Tarasova (WMO)
Although climate change and air pollution are
closely connected, these two environmental
challenges are still viewed as separate issues
and dealt with by different science communities and within different policy frameworks.
However, it is not possible to separate the
anthropogenic emissions into two distinct
categories – atmospheric pollutants and climate-active species – as many air pollutants,
such as tropospheric ozone or aerosol, have
direct or indirect impacts on climate. Air pollution itself has detrimental effects on human
health and the environment (see following figure). According to a report by WHO,1 over 90%
of the urban population of the world breathes
air containing levels of outdoor air pollutants
that exceed WHO guidelines. Air pollution
inside and outside the home is the second
leading cause of death from non-communicable
disease worldwide.

The effects, both direct and indirect, of air
quality on climate change are related to the
interactions of atmospheric pollutants with
solar radiation. The global average radiative
forcing of ozone is similar to that of CH4, and
about one quarter of that due to CO2. 3 Tropospheric ozone negatively affects ecosystems
and reduces their capacity to absorb CO 2 .
Another indirect impact of ozone on radiative
forcing has the opposite effect: production of
the hydroxyl radical increases with increasing
ozone concentration, shortening the lifetime
of CH4 in the atmosphere. Particulate matter,
which has adverse effects on human health, has
both direct and indirect influences on radiative
forcing. Depending on its composition, it can
scatter or absorb incoming radiation directly,
but particles can also act as cloud condensation
nuclei and thereby affect radiative forcing and
weather patterns indirectly. Deposition of the
particles on snow and ice changes their albedo.

Air quality and climate change are not only
driven by common constituents, they are also
closely interlinked through diverse atmospheric

Climate change also affects air quality through
changes in meteorology (including temperature, precipitations, boundary-layer dynamics,

humidity and cloud cover) and through the
impact it has on natural emissions. Increasing
temperatures lead to increasing emissions
of volatile organic compounds that are the
precursors of tropospheric ozone and aerosols. Higher temperatures are also favourable
for faster ozone formation. As the climate
changes, ozone in peak episodes is expected
to increase – the so-called “climate penalty”.
Climate change is also associated with changing
transport patterns and mixing and can lead to
more frequent extreme pollution events due
to stagnation. Changes in wildfire frequencies
could lead to increasing levels of pollution,
particularly aerosols. Changing precipitation
patterns affect the deposition of pollutants.
Despite a growing recognition of the strong links
between the two areas, policies addressing air
pollution and those focusing on climate change
remain weakly linked. The major challenge is to
identify policies that provide “win–win” solutions, as not all climate policies are beneficial
for air pollution reductions and vice versa. One
example is the use of biofuels that leads to a

increased / changed
emissions

reduction of CO2 but contributes to increasing
levels of tropospheric ozone. An integrated
approach is therefore needed to evaluate the
air quality and climate policies that take into
account the factors outlined above. Such integrated policies are likely to constitute the best
environmental policy strategies in terms of
both social and economic costs.

International civil aviation
and adaptation to climate change

Environment, ICAO

While the efforts of ICAO are mainly focused
on reducing the impact of international civil
aviation on the global climate, the impact of
climate change has been identified as a significant risk for the aviation sector and the work of
ICAO on climate adaptation is the foundation
of risk preparedness.1 A key question is how
should aviation infrastructure be designed and
built so that CO2 emissions are limited, and
more extreme weather events, water scarcity,
sandstorms, or any impact attributable to a
changing climate, can be withstood.
A report was recently produced by ICAO2
synthesizing existing information on the range
of projected climate impacts in the aviation
sector to better understand risks to aviation
operations and infrastructure. This included a
literature review and a survey that was sent to

ICAO Assembly Resolution A39-2 – “Consolidated statement of
continuing ICAO policies and practices related to environmental
protection – climate change” requests (the Council) to “identify
the potential impacts of climate change on international aviation
operations and related infrastructure and identify adaptation
measures to address the potential climate change impacts, in
cooperation with other relevant international organizations and
the industry”.

all ICAO member States to collect information
on the level of awareness of climate change
impacts, the nature of the impacts and how
they will affect international aviation, as well
as the self-assessed level of preparedness of
the various international aviation stakeholders.
One of the key findings of the survey showed
that 74% of respondents found that their
aviation sectors are already experiencing
some climate change impacts, while 17%
expected some impact by 2030. Potential
climate impacts on the aviation sector were
identified for eight climate impact categories:
sea-level rise, increased intensity of storms,
temperature change, changing precipitation,
changing icing conditions, changing wind
direction, desertification, and changes to biodiversity. Consideration was also given to
potential climate change impacts to business
and economics, as well as climate change risk
assessment and adaptation planning.
The impacts on the aviation system were
identified globally and are shown in the ICAO
global climate adaptation risk map (see figure).
The survey showed that 30% of respondents

have already implemented climate adaptation
measures, 25% intend to do so in the next
5 to 10 years, while 6% indicate that they
have no measures planned. A climate change
risk assessment is required to determine the
climate change vulnerabilities before an adaptation strategy is developed.
Regarding the preparedness of the global aviation sector for climate change impacts, the
majority of respondents stated that while the
sector has engaged heavily in climate change
mitigation efforts, more effort should be given
to climate change adaptation, including the
need for more global coordination. Many
respondents identified the need for more outreach, training and capacity-building, as well

as increasing the understanding of specific
vulnerabilities for the sector. Respondents also
thought that the development of adaptation risk
assessments, policies and planning for resilience at the global level could also be required.
The International Civil Aviation Organization
envisages to cooperate with international
experts to develop the first globally recognized
climate change risk assessment methodology.
The cornerstone of this methodology will
be the identification, characterization and
visualization of the climate change impacts
on international aviation and identification of
the risks to which the operations and infrastructure may be exposed based on climate
change projections and scenarios.
