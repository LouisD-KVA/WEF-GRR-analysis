BIS 87th Annual Report

87th Annual Report

submitted to the Annual General Meeting
of the Bank for International Settlements
held in Basel on 25 June 2017

Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is my pleasure to submit to you the 87th Annual Report of the Bank for
International Settlements for the financial year which ended on 31 March 2017.
The net profit for the year amounted to SDR 827.6 million, compared with
SDR 412.9 million for the preceding year. Details of the results for the financial year
2016/17 may be found on pages 171–2 of this Report under “Financial activities
and results”.
The Board of Directors proposes, in application of Article 51 of the Bank’s
Statutes, that the present General Meeting apply the sum of SDR 167.4 million in
payment of a dividend of SDR 300 per share. This would comprise a normal
dividend of SDR 225 per share and a supplementary dividend of SDR 75 per share,
and be payable in any constituent currency of the SDR, or in Swiss francs.
The Board further recommends that SDR 33.0 million be transferred to the
general reserve fund and the remainder – amounting to SDR 627.2 million – to the
free reserve fund.
If these proposals are approved, the Bank’s dividend for the financial year
2016/17 will be payable to shareholders on 29 June 2017.

Overview of the economic chapters

Chapter I: Towards resilient growth
Over the past year, the global economy has strengthened further. Growth has
approached long-term averages, unemployment rates have fallen towards pre-crisis
levels and inflation rates have edged closer to central bank objectives. With nearterm prospects the best in a long time, this year’s Annual Report examines four
risks that could threaten the sustainability of the expansion in the medium term: a
rise in inflation; financial stress as financial cycles mature; weaker consumption and
investment, mainly under the weight of debt; and a rise in protectionism. To a large
extent, these risks are rooted in the “risky trinity” highlighted in last year’s Annual
Report: unusually low productivity growth, unusually high debt levels, and unusually
limited room for policy manoeuvre. Thus, the most promising policy strategy is to
take advantage of the prevailing tailwinds to build greater economic resilience,
nationally and globally. Raising the economy’s growth potential is critical. At the
national level, this means rebalancing policy towards structural reforms, relieving an
overburdened monetary policy, and implementing holistic frameworks that tackle
the financial cycle more systematically. At the global level, it means reinforcing the
multilateral approach to policy – the only one capable of addressing the common
challenges the world is facing.

Chapter II: Political shocks reorient markets
Financial markets were confronted by a changing political environment as the
economic background brightened. Political events surprised market participants,
who quickly needed to take views on the shifting policy direction and its economic
implications. Attention shifted away from monetary policy, and political events took
centre stage. A natural consequence of this reorientation was a change to longestablished patterns of correlation and risk. Instead of broad-based swings between
“risk-on” and “risk-off” positions, investors began to differentiate more across sectors
and countries. Bond yields diverged across the major economies, with knock-on
effects on foreign exchange markets. At the same time, a gap opened up between
surging measures of policy uncertainty and record-low financial market volatility,
while a number of indicators pointed to increased tail risks. Pricing anomalies that
emerged in the aftermath of the Great Financial Crisis (GFC) retreated but did not
disappear, suggesting that such anomalies may have become a more permanent
feature of markets.

Chapter III: The global economy: maturing recoveries,
turning financial cycles?
The global cyclical upswing strengthened considerably during the year under
review, with virtually all major economies expanding by early 2017. Consumption
was a key factor driving aggregate demand, but business investment also showed
signs of a rebound. At the same time, shrinking measures of economic slack

suggested that the expansion was maturing. Financial cycles were in the expansion
phase in many countries, supporting the economic upswing. In part related to the
financial cycle, there are a number of medium-term risks to a sustainable economic
expansion. Leading indicators of financial distress signal risks from high private
debt and house prices in several economies that were not at the epicentre of the
GFC. High household debt might become a drag on demand in some countries,
especially if rising interest rates were to boost debt service burdens. Elevated
corporate debt, coupled with weak productivity growth, could weigh on investment.
And rising protectionist sentiment could hurt economic prospects. Yet the cyclical
tailwinds open a window of opportunity to pursue policies that enhance resilience
and reduce risks to sustainable growth.

Chapter IV: Monetary policy: inching towards normalisation
Monetary policy remained generally highly accommodative, with nominal and real
interest rates kept very low and central bank balance sheets remaining large or
growing further. Against the backdrop of strengthening growth, inflation
developments took centre stage in central bank decisions. While inflation rates for
the most part became better aligned with central bank price stability mandates, the
significant reduction in labour market slack raised questions about upside inflation
risks. That said, an evaluation of those risks based on historical labour market
developments suggests that they are unlikely to be the primary risk to the global
expansion under way. Policy normalisation presents unprecedented challenges,
given the current high debt levels and unusual uncertainty. A strategy of gradualism
and transparency has clear benefits but is no panacea, as it may also encourage
further risk-taking and slow down the build-up of policymakers’ room for manoeuvre.

Chapter V: The financial sector – preparing for the future
The financial sector faces an improving but still challenging environment. The nearterm economic outlook has brightened substantially. At the same time, intermediation
margins remain compressed across the major economies and the sector is grappling
with structural forces such as technological innovation and consolidation pressures.
With the main chapters of regulatory reform about to be closed, space is opening
up for banks and other financial institutions to further increase resilience. One area
of attention is global US dollar funding markets, which are likely to remain a key
pressure point during episodes of market stress. Banks’ continued heavy reliance on
short-term US dollar funding, paired with a high degree of market concentration
and interconnectedness, underscores the importance of supervisory cooperation
and effective backstops. The ultimate aim is a stronger financial system that helps
support the resilience of the global economy.

Chapter VI: Understanding globalisation
Economic globalisation has contributed to a substantial rise in living standards and
falling poverty over the past half-century. Tighter trade and financial integration
are deeply intertwined: international trade not only relies on, but also generates,
financial linkages. Together, international trade and finance have enhanced
competition and spread technology, driving efficiency gains and aggregate
productivity. Like any other form of far-reaching economic change, globalisation

4

BIS 87th Annual Report

poses challenges. For example, globalisation has coincided with rising withincountry income inequality in some countries, although the evidence indicates that
technology has been the main driver. Moreover, financial openness exposes
economies to destabilising external influences. Properly designed domestic policies
can enhance the gains from globalisation and mitigate the adjustment costs. And
international cooperation must supplement such policies in order to address global
linkages. Completing international financial reforms is one priority. Global currencies
call for international cooperation, effective crisis management and more systematic
consideration of cross-border spillovers and spillbacks.

I. Towards resilient growth

What a difference a year can make in the global economy, in terms of both facts
and, above all, sentiment. The facts paint a brighter picture. There are clear signs
that growth has gathered momentum. Economic slack in the major economies has
diminished further; indeed, in some of them unemployment rates have fallen back
to levels consistent with full employment. Inflation readings have moved closer
to central bank objectives, and deflation risks no longer figure in economic
projections. But sentiment has swung even more than facts. Gloom has given way
to confidence. We noted last year that conditions were not as dire as typically
portrayed. Now, concerns about secular stagnation have receded: all the talk has
been about a revival of animal spirits and reflation on the back of buoyant financial
markets. And with the outcome of the US presidential election as a turning point,
political events have taken over from central bank pronouncements as the main
financial market driver.
Yet, despite the best near-term prospects for a long time, paradoxes and
tensions abound. Financial market volatility has plummeted even as indicators of
policy uncertainty have surged. Stock markets have been buoyant, but bond yields
have not risen commensurately. And globalisation, a powerful engine of world
growth, has slowed and come under a protectionist threat.
Against this backdrop, the main theme of this year’s Annual Report is the
sustainability of the current expansion. What are the medium-term risks? What
should policy do about them? And, can we take advantage of the opportunities
that a stronger economy offers?
The Report evaluates four risks – geopolitical ones aside – that could undermine
the sustainability of the upswing. First, a significant rise in inflation could choke the
expansion by forcing central banks to tighten policy more than expected. This
typical postwar scenario moved into focus last year, even in the absence of any
evidence of a resurgence of inflation. Second, and less appreciated, serious financial
stress could materialise as financial cycles mature if their contraction phase were to
turn into a more serious bust. This is what happened most spectacularly with the
Great Financial Crisis (GFC). Third, short of serious financial stress, consumption
might weaken under the weight of debt, and investment might fail to take over as
the main growth engine. There is evidence that consumption-led growth is less
durable, not least because it fails to generate sufficient increases in productive
capital. Finally, a rise in protectionism could challenge the open global economic
order. History shows that trade tensions can sap the global economy’s strength.
These risks may appear independent, but they are not. For instance, policy
tightening to contain an inflation spurt could trigger, or amplify, a financial bust in
the more vulnerable countries. This would be especially true if higher policy rates
coincided with a snapback in bond yields and US dollar appreciation: the strong
post-crisis expansion of dollar-denominated debt has raised vulnerabilities,
particularly in some emerging market economies (EMEs). Indeed, an overarching
issue is the global economy’s sensitivity to higher interest rates given the continued
accumulation of debt in relation to GDP, complicating the policy normalisation
process (Graph I.1). As another example, a withdrawal into trade protectionism
could spark financial strains and make higher inflation more likely. And the
emergence of systemic financial strains yet again, or simply much slower growth,
could heighten the protectionist threat beyond critical levels.

now projected to reach 3.5% in 2017 (consensus forecast). This rate would be in line
with the long-term historical average, although below the close to 4% experienced
during the pre-crisis “golden decade”. The pickup was especially marked in advanced
economies, where, going into 2017, confidence indicators had reached readings not
seen in years. Growth was more mixed in EMEs, although there too performance
improved, buoyed by higher commodity prices. In particular, the feared sharp
slowdown in China did not materialise, as the authorities stepped in once more to
support the economy, albeit at the cost of a further expansion in debt.

in labour markets (Chapter III and Graph I.2, centre panel). Unemployment rates in

major advanced economies continued to decline. In some that had been at the
core of the GFC, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, unemployment
returned to pre-crisis levels; in others, such as Japan, it was well below. While still
comparatively high, unemployment also ebbed further in the euro area, reaching
levels last seen some eight years ago.
Inflation, on balance, moved closer to central bank objectives (Chapter IV and
Graph I.2, right-hand panel). Boosted to a considerable extent by higher oil prices,
headline rates in several advanced economies rose somewhat; core rates remained
more subdued. Inflation actually decreased in some EMEs where it had been above
target, not least as a result of exchange rate movements. Consensus forecasts for
2017 point to a moderate increase globally.
The change in financial market sentiment was remarkable (Chapter II). In the
wake of the US election, after a short-lived fall, markets rebounded, as concerns
about a future of slow growth gave way to renewed optimism. Subsequently
comforted by better data releases, the “reflation trade” lingered on in the following
months. Equity markets soared and volatilities sank to very low levels, indicative of
high risk appetite. The increase in bond yields that had started in July accelerated.
On balance, however, bond yields still hovered within historically low ranges, and
by May 2017 they had reversed a significant part of the increase, when the reflation
trade faded. The US dollar followed an even more see-saw pattern, surging until
early 2017 and then retracing its gains.
Equally remarkable was the shift in the main forces driving markets (Chapter II).
Politics, notably the UK vote to leave the European Union (Brexit) and above all the
US election, took over from central banks. Correspondingly, the “risk-on”/”risk-off”
phases so common post-crisis in response to central banks’ words and actions gave
way to a more differentiated pattern in sync with political statements and events.
Hence, in particular, the more heterogeneous movements of financial prices across
asset classes, sectors and regions in the wake of the US election and in light of
evolving prospects for fiscal expansion, tax cuts, deregulation and protectionism.

BIS 87th Annual Report

This shift went hand in hand with the opening-up of an unprecedented wedge
between indices of policy uncertainty, which soared, and of financial market
volatility, which sank.
That said, central banks continued to exert a significant influence on markets.
Largely reflecting the monetary policy outlook and central bank asset purchases, an
unusually wide gap opened up between the US dollar yield curve, on the one hand,
and its yen and euro equivalents, on the other. This contributed to sizeable crosscurrency portfolio flows, often on a currency-hedged basis, helping to explain a
puzzling market anomaly: the breakdown of covered interest parity (Chapter II). The
corresponding premium on dollar funding through the FX market relative to the
money market also signalled a more constrained use of banks’ balance sheet
capacity. Banks were less willing than pre-crisis to engage in balance sheet-intensive
arbitrage (Chapter V).
The condition and near-term prospects of the financial industry improved but
remained challenging (Chapter V). The outlook for higher interest rates and a
stronger economy helped bank equity prices to outperform the market. Profits in
crisis-hit countries increased somewhat, supporting banks’ efforts to further
replenish their capital cushions. And profitability was generally higher in countries
experiencing strong financial cycle expansions. Even so, market scepticism lingered,
as reflected in comparatively low price-to-book ratios or credit ratings for many
banks. Euro area banks were especially affected as they struggled with excess
capacity and high non-performing loans in some member countries. Profitability in
the insurance sector of the main advanced economies changed little, weighed
down even more than that of the banking sector by persistently low interest rates.

Sustainability
This brief review of the past year indicates that the global economy’s performance
has improved considerably and that its near-term prospects appear the best in a
long time. Moreover, the central scenario delineated by private and official sector
forecasts points to further gradual improvement: headwinds abate, the global
economy gathers steam, monetary policy is gradually normalised, and the expansion
becomes entrenched and sustainable. Indeed, the financial market sentiment is
broadly consistent with this scenario.
As always, however, such outcomes cannot be taken for granted. Market and
official expectations have been repeatedly disappointed since the GFC. And there is
generally not much of value in macroeconomic forecasts beyond the near term. By
construction, they assume a return to long-term trends, which is one reason why
they do not anticipate recessions. Moreover, while its pace has been moderate
overall, the current expansion is already one of the longest on record.
Against this backdrop, it is worth examining key medium-term risks to the
outlook. We next consider, sequentially, an inflation spurt, financial cycle risks, a
failure of investment to take over the lead from potentially weaker consumption,
and the protectionist threat that could hit trade and roll back globalisation.

Inflation
A rise in inflation, forcing central banks to tighten substantially, has been the typical
trigger of postwar recessions. The latest one was an exception: while monetary
policy did tighten somewhat, it was the collapse of a financial boom under its own
weight that played the main role. Could the more typical postwar pattern reassert
itself (Chapter IV)?

10

BIS 87th Annual Report

There are prima facie reasons to believe inflation could increase significantly
(Graph I.3, left-hand panel). It has already been edging up. More importantly,
economic slack is vanishing, as suggested by estimates of the relationship between
output and its potential (“output gaps”) and, even more so, by labour market
indicators. And this is happening in several countries simultaneously – a development
not to be underestimated given evidence that global measures of slack help predict
inflation over and above domestic ones. These signs suggest that it would be
unwise to take much comfort from the fact that higher inflation has recently
mirrored mainly a higher oil price: they could point to greater inflation momentum
going forward.
At the same time, a substantial and lasting flare-up of inflation does not seem
likely (Chapter IV). The link between economic slack and price inflation has proved
rather elusive for quite some time now (Graph I.3, right-hand panel). To be sure, the
corresponding link between labour market slack and wage inflation appears to be
more reliable. Even so, there is evidence that its strength has declined over time,
consistent with the loss of labour’s “pricing” power captured by labour market
indicators (same panel). And, in turn, the link between increases in unit labour costs
and price inflation has been surprisingly weak.
The deeper reasons for these developments are not well understood. One
possibility is that they reflect central banks’ greater inflation-fighting credibility.
Another is that they mainly mirror more secular disinflationary pressures associated
with globalisation and the entry of low-cost producers into the global trading system,
not least China and former communist countries. Alongside technological pressures,
these developments have arguably sapped both the bargaining power of labour and
the pricing power of firms, making the wage-price spirals of the past less likely.
These arguments suggest that, while an inflation spurt cannot be excluded, it
may not be the main factor threatening the expansion, at least in the near term.
Judging from what is priced in financial assets, also financial market participants
appear to hold this view.

Financial cycle risks
In light of the above, the potential role of financial cycle risks comes to the fore.
The main cause of the next recession will perhaps resemble more closely that of the
latest one – a financial cycle bust. In fact, the recessions in the early 1990s in a
number of advanced economies, without approaching the depth and breadth of
the latest one, had already begun to exhibit similar features: they had been
preceded by outsize increases in credit and property prices, which collapsed once
monetary policy started to tighten, leading to financial and banking strains. And for
EMEs, financial crises linked to financial cycle busts have been quite prominent,
often triggered or amplified by the loss of external funding; recall, for instance, the
Asian crisis some 20 years ago.
Leading indicators of financial distress constructed along the above lines do
point to potential risks (Chapter III). Admittedly, such risks are not apparent in the
countries at the core of the GFC, where domestic financial booms collapsed, such
as the United States, the United Kingdom or Spain. There, some private sector
deleveraging has taken place and financial cycle expansions are still comparatively
young. The main source of near-term concerns in crisis-hit economies is the failure
to fully repair banks’ balance sheets in some countries, notably in parts of the euro
area, especially where the public sector’s own balance sheet looks fragile (Chapter V).
Political uncertainties compound these concerns.
Rather, the classical signs of financial cycle risks are apparent in several
countries largely spared by the GFC, which saw financial expansions gather pace in
its aftermath. This group comprises several EMEs, including the largest, as well as a
number of advanced economies, notably some commodity exporters buoyed by
the long post-crisis commodity boom. In all of these economies, of course, interest
rates have been very low, or even negative, as inflation has stayed low, or even
given way to deflation, despite strong economic performance. Financial cycles in
this group are at different stages. In some cases, such as China, the booms are
continuing and maturing; in others, such as Brazil, they have already turned to bust
and recessions have occurred, although without ushering in a full-blown financial
crisis.
EMEs face an additional challenge: the comparatively large amount of FX debt,
mainly in US dollars (Chapters III, V and VI). Dollar debt has typically played a
critical role in EME financial crises in the past, either as a trigger, such as when gross
dollar-denominated capital flows reversed, or as an amplifier. The conjunction of a
domestic currency depreciation and higher US dollar interest rates can be poisonous
in the presence of large currency mismatches. From 2009 to end-2016, US dollar
credit to non-banks located outside the United States – a bellwether BIS indicator
of global liquidity – soared by around 50% to some $10.5 trillion; for those in EMEs
alone, it more than doubled, to $3.6 trillion.
Compared with the past, several factors mitigate the risk linked to FX debt.
Countries have adopted more flexible exchange rate regimes: while no panacea,
these should make currency crashes less likely and induce less FX risk-taking ex
ante. Countries have also built up foreign currency war chests, which should cushion
the blow if strains emerge. And the amounts of FX debt in relation to GDP are, on
balance, still not as high as before previous financial crises. Indeed, several countries
have absorbed large exchange rate adjustments in recent years. Even so,
vulnerabilities should not be taken lightly, at least where large amounts of FX debt
coincide with outsize domestic financial booms. This is one reason why a tightening
of US monetary policy and a US dollar appreciation may signal global financial
market retrenchment and higher risk aversion, with the dollar acting as a kind of
“fear gauge”.2

12

BIS 87th Annual Report

More generally, while leading indicators of financial distress provide a general
sense of a build-up of risk, they have a number of limitations. In particular, they tell
us little about the precise timing of its materialisation, the intensity of strains or
their precise dynamics. After all, policymakers have taken major steps post-crisis to
improve the strength of regulatory and supervisory frameworks, which could alter
the statistical relationships found in the data. For instance, many EMEs have had
recourse to a wide array of macroprudential measures to tame the financial cycle.
While these have not succeeded in avoiding the build-up of outsize financial
booms, they can make the financial system more resilient to the subsequent bust.
As the experience of Brazil indicates, this may not prevent a recession, but it may
limit the risk of a financial crisis. These limitations suggest that the indicators need
to be treated with caution.

Consumption and investment
Short of any serious financial strains, the expansion could end because of weakness
in domestic aggregate demand (Chapter III). In many countries, the recent
expansion has been consumption-led, with consumption growth outpacing that of
GDP. By contrast, investment has been comparatively subdued until recently. Could
consumption weaken? And what are the prospects for a sustained strengthening of
investment? Naturally, the expansion would be more sustainable if investment
became the main growth engine. This would boost productivity and help keep
medium-term inflationary pressures in check. Empirical evidence indicating that
consumption-led growth is less sustainable is consistent with this view.
While consumption could weaken as a result of smaller employment gains as
capacity constraints are hit, the more serious vulnerabilities reflect the continued
accumulation of debt, sometimes on the back of historically high asset prices. Asset
price declines could put pressure on balance sheets, especially if they coincided
with higher interest rates. Indeed, BIS research has uncovered an important but
underappreciated role of debt service burdens in driving expenditures (Chapter III).
An analysis of the debt service burden-induced interest rate sensitivity of
consumption points to vulnerabilities (Chapter III and Graph I.4). These are apparent
in economies that have experienced household credit booms post-crisis, often
alongside strong property price increases, including several small open economies
and some EMEs. Increases in interest rates beyond what is currently priced in
markets could weaken consumption considerably. By contrast, in some crisis-hit
countries, such as the United States, the safety cushion is considerably larger
following the deleveraging that has already taken place.
Investment has been rather weak post-crisis in relation to GDP, at least in
advanced economies (Chapter III). The drop has reflected in part a correction in
residential investment after the pre-crisis boom, but also a decline in the nonresidential component. In EMEs, investment has proved generally more resilient,
notably reflecting the surge in China and the associated boost to commodity prices.
Post-crisis investment weakness, coupled with resource misallocations, has no
doubt contributed to the further deceleration of productivity growth. Could the
recent welcome pickup in investment fail to strengthen enough?
While interest rates matter for investment, a bigger role is played by profits,
uncertainty and cash flows. From this perspective, while the very high readings of
policy uncertainty indicators may be a reason for concern, they have not sapped
the recent pickup so far. In EMEs, a cause for concern has been the sharp increase
in corporate debt in several economies, sometimes in foreign currency. Indeed,
empirical evidence points to a link between US dollar appreciation and investment
weakness in many EMEs (Chapter III). China stands out, given the combination of

in EMEs, including through a slump in commodity prices.

Deglobalisation
Since the GFC, protectionist arguments have been gaining ground. They have been
part of a broader social and political backlash against globalisation. Rolling back
globalisation would strike a major blow against the prospects for a sustained and
robust expansion. Investment would be the first casualty, given its tight link with
trade. But the seismic change in institutional frameworks and policy regimes would
have a broader and longer-lasting impact. It is worth exploring these issues in more
detail, which is why we devote a whole chapter to them in this year’s Report
(Chapter VI).
As is well known, the gradual process of tighter integration that the global
economy has witnessed since World War II – and which took a quantum leap
following the end of the cold war era – is not unprecedented (Graph I.5, left-hand
panel). A first globalisation wave took place starting in the second half of the 19th
century, became entrenched during the gold standard period, and took a big blow
with World War I before collapsing a decade later in the wake of the Great
Depression.
There are similarities but also important differences between the two waves.
Both periods saw a major rise in real and financial integration, driven by political
decisions and supported by technological innovation. But, economically, the more
recent wave has been both broader and deeper, even as it has relied less on
migration flows. Hence the unprecedented growth in global value chains (GVCs)
and cross-border financial claims.
While there is a natural tendency to discuss real and financial globalisation
separately, the two are intertwined. Exports and imports rely heavily on international
financing. Transnational ownership of companies through foreign direct investment

data suggest about the first globalisation wave.
There is some evidence that globalisation has slowed post-crisis, but it is not in
retreat. Trade in relation to world GDP and GVCs have plateaued. And while
financial integration broadly defined seems to have moderated, bank lending has
pulled back. However, a closer look at the BIS statistics indicates that the contraction
largely reflects a pullback by euro area banks and is regional in nature. Banks from
Asia and elsewhere have taken over, and integration has not flagged. Moreover,
securities issuance has outpaced bank lending, in line with the rise of institutional
investors and asset managers.
From a policy perspective, the reasons for the slowdown matter. The slowdown

economic decisions. Much of the decline in trade and financial linkages seems to
have that character. It would be more of a concern if it reflected national biases. In
both trade and finance, there are signs that this too may have started to occur.
Hence the increase in trade restrictions and in ring-fencing in the financial sector.
No doubt some of those decisions may be justified, but they could herald a broader
and more damaging backlash.
Formal statistical evidence, casual observation and plain logic indicate that
globalisation has been a major force supporting world growth and higher living
standards. Globalisation has helped lift large parts of the world population out of
poverty and reduce inequality between countries. It is simply unimaginable that
EMEs could have grown so much without being integrated in the global economy.
Conceptually, integration spreads knowledge, fosters specialisation and allows
production to take place where costs are lower. It is akin to what economists would
call a series of major positive supply side shocks that, in turn, promote demand.
At the same time, it is also well known that globalisation poses challenges. First,
its benefits may be unevenly distributed, especially if economies are not ready or
able to adapt. Trade displaces workers and capital in those sectors that are more
exposed to international competition. And it may also increase income inequality in
some countries. Opening up trade with countries where labour is abundant and
cheap puts pressure on wages in those where it is scarcer and more expensive. It can
thus erode labour’s pricing power, tilt the income distribution towards capital, and
widen the skilled/unskilled labour wedge. Second, opening up the capital account
without sufficient safeguards can expose the country to greater financial risks.
The empirical evidence confirms, but also qualifies, the impact on labour
markets and income distribution (Chapter VI). Low-skill jobs have migrated to lowcost producers as large industrial segments have been displaced in the less
competitive economies. And while studies have found an impact on income
inequality, they have generally concluded that technology has been much more
important: the mechanisms are similar and naturally interact, but the spread of
technology across the whole economy has made its influence more pervasive.
It is also well recognised by now that greater financial openness can channel
financial instability. Just as with domestic financial liberalisation, unless sufficient
safeguards are in place, it can increase the amplitude of financial booms and busts
– the so-called “procyclicality” of the financial system. In the 85th Annual Report,
we devoted a whole chapter to this issue, exploring weaknesses in the international
monetary and financial system.3 The free flow of financial capital across borders
and currencies can encourage exchange rate overshooting, exacerbate the build-up
of risks and magnify financial distress – that is, increase the system’s “excess
elasticity”. The dominant role of the US dollar as international currency adds to this
weakness, by amplifying the divergence between the interests of the country of
issue and the rest of the world.4 Hence the outsize influence of US monetary policy
on monetary and financial conditions globally.
These side effects of globalisation do not imply that it should be rolled back;
rather, they indicate that it should be properly governed and managed (see below).
A roll-back would have harmful short-term and long-term consequences. In the
short term, greater protectionism would weaken global demand and jeopardise the
durability and strength of the expansion, by damaging trade and raising the spectre
of a sudden stop in both investment and FDI. In the longer term, it would endanger
the productivity gains induced by greater openness and threaten a revival of
inflation. In more closed, possibly financially repressed economies, the temptation
would be to inflate debts away, and wage-price spirals could again become more
likely, raising the risk of a return of the stagflation of yesteryear.

BIS 87th Annual Report

Policy
Given the risks ahead, how can policymakers best turn the current upswing into
sustainable and robust global growth? Over the past year, a broad consensus has
been emerging about the need to rebalance the policy mix, lightening the burden
on monetary policy and relying more on fiscal measures and structural reforms.
Still, views differ about policy priorities. If we are to understand how to adjudicate
among them, we need to take a step back and consider some broader questions
underlying current analytical frameworks.
Much of the current policy discourse revolves around two propositions. The first
is that policymakers are able to fine-tune the economy, by operating levers that
influence aggregate demand, output and inflation in a powerful and predictable
way. The second is that there is a neat distinction between the short run, the
preserve of aggregate demand, and the long run, the preserve of aggregate supply.
While there is clearly some truth in both propositions, reality is much more
nuanced. As history has repeatedly indicated, it is all too easy to overestimate
policymakers’ ability to steer the economy. Moreover, aggregate demand and
supply interact so that the short and long run blend into each other.
The post-crisis experience is a sobering illustration of these nuances. It has
proved much harder than expected to boost growth and inflation despite
unprecedented measures. And the recession, itself the legacy of the previous
unsustainable financial boom, appears to have left profound scars: output losses
have been huge and productivity growth persistently weakened.
This experience highlights the need to evaluate policy in a long-term context.
Policy actions taken at a given point in time, regardless of whether they target
demand or supply, have long-lasting influences. And by affecting, for instance, the
cumulative stock of debt or the room for policy manoeuvre, they help shape the
economic environment that policymakers take as given, or “exogenous”, when the
future becomes today.5 Unless these effects are properly taken into account, policy
options can narrow substantially over time, as appears to have happened over the
past decade.
This perspective suggests that, rather than seeking to fine-tune the economy, a
more promising approach would be to take advantage of the current strong
tailwinds to strengthen the economy’s resilience, at both the domestic and global
level. The notion of resilience helps avoid the trap of overestimating policymakers’
economic steering powers. And it fosters the longer-term horizons so essential to
place policy in its proper intertemporal context.
Resilience, broadly defined, means more than just the capacity to withstand
unforeseen developments or “shocks”. It also means reducing the likelihood that
shocks will materialise in the first place, by limiting policy uncertainty and the
build-up of vulnerabilities, such as those stemming from financial imbalances.6 And
it means increasing the economy’s adaptability to long-term trends, such as those
linked to ageing populations, slowing productivity, technology or globalisation. We
next discuss how strengthening resilience can help address the current domestic
and global challenges.

Building resilience: the domestic challenge
Building resilience domestically is a multifaceted challenge. Consider, in turn,
monetary, fiscal and structural policies as well as their role in tackling the financial
cycle.
There is a broad consensus now that monetary policy has been overburdened
for far too long. It has become, in that popular phrase, “the only game in town”. In

BIS 87th Annual Report

17

the process, central bank balance sheets have become bloated, policy interest rates
have been ultra-low for a long time, and central banks have extended their direct
influence way out along the sovereign yield curve as well as to other asset classes,
such as private sector debt and even equity.
Building resilience would suggest attaching particular importance to enhancing
policy space, so as to be better prepared to tackle the next recession. This, in turn,
would suggest taking advantage of the economy’s tailwinds to pursue normalisation
with a steady hand as domestic circumstances permit. “As domestic circumstances
permit” is an essential qualifier, since how far normalisation is possible depends on
country-specific factors, involving both the economy and monetary frameworks.
The scope differs substantially across countries. Even so, the broad strategy could
be common.
Normalisation presents a number of tough challenges (Chapter IV). Many of
them stem from the journey’s starting point – the unprecedented monetary
conditions that have prevailed post-crisis. As markets have grown used to central
banks’ helping crutch, debt levels have continued to rise globally and the valuation
of a broad range of assets looks rich and predicated on the continuation of very
low interest rates and bond yields (Chapter II). On the one hand, heightened
uncertainty naturally induces central banks to move very gradually with interest
rates, and even more so with their balance sheets, with changes that are well
telegraphed. On the other hand, that very gradualism implies a slower build-up of
policy space. And it may also induce further risk-taking and promote the conditions
that make a smooth exit harder. The risk of a snapback in bond yields, for instance,
looms large.7 Trade-offs are further complicated by the spillovers that domestic
actions may have globally, especially in the case of the US dollar.
As a result, the road is bound to be bumpy. Normalisation may well not
proceed linearly, but in fits and starts, as central banks test the waters in light of
evolving conditions. And yet it is essential for financial markets and the broader
economy to shake off their unusual dependence on central banks’ unprecedented
policies.
Building resilience through fiscal policy has two dimensions. The first is to
prioritise the use of any available fiscal space. Several areas spring to mind. One is
to support growth-friendly structural reforms (see below). Another is to reinforce
support for globalisation by addressing the dislocations it can cause. Here, more
general approaches appear superior to targeted ones, since the specific firms and
individuals affected may be hard to identify. The basic principle is to save people,
not jobs, by promoting retraining and the flexible reallocation of resources. Last but
not least, public support for balance sheet repair remains a priority where private
sources have been exhausted. Resolving non-performing loans is paramount for
unlocking the financing of productive investments (Chapter V). What would be
unwise at the current juncture would be simply to resort to deficit spending where
the economy is close to full employment. This does not rule out the streamlining of
tax systems or judicious and well executed public investments. But, as always,
implementation is of the essence and far from straightforward, as the historical
record suggests.
The second dimension concerns enhancing fiscal space over time. A precondition
is its prudent measurement. As discussed extensively in last year’s Annual Report,
this requires incorporating in current methodologies a number of factors that tend
to be underplayed or excluded – the need for a buffer for potential financial risks,
realistic financial market responses to higher sovereign risks, and the burden of
ageing populations. It also requires considering the impact that the combination of
snapback risk and central bank large-scale asset purchases might have on the
interest sensitivity of government deficits (Chapter IV). More generally, a prudent

assessment of fiscal space could anchor the needed medium-term consolidation of
public finances.
Building resilience through structural policies is essential. Structural policies are
the only ones that hold the promise of raising the long-term growth potential and
fostering an environment conducive to long-term investment. Unfortunately, far
from speeding up, implementation has been slowing down. This has occurred even
though the empirical evidence indicates that, contrary to a widespread belief, many
measures do not depress aggregate demand even in the short run.8 Ostensibly, the
political costs of reform exceed the economic ones. Here, just as with the
globalisation-induced challenges, it is the concentration of the costs on specific
groups that matters most.

Tackling the financial cycle would call for more symmetrical policies. Otherwise,
over long horizons, failing to constrain financial booms but easing aggressively and
persistently during busts could lead to successive episodes of serious financial
stress, a progressive loss of policy ammunition and a debt trap. Along this path, for
instance, interest rates would decline and debt continue to increase, eventually
making it hard to raise interest rates without damaging the economy (Graph I.6).
From this perspective, there are some uncomfortable signs: monetary policy has
been hitting its limits; fiscal positions in a number of economies look unsustainable,
especially if one considers the burden of ageing populations; and global debt-toGDP ratios have kept rising.

Building resilience: the global challenge
While there is a lot that domestic policy can do to build resilience, certain challenges
call for a global response. The goal is to set out a clear and consistent multilateral
framework – the rules of the game – for actions to be taken either at the national
level or jointly internationally. Those rules would naturally vary in terms of specificity
and tightness depending on the area, ranging from broad principles to common
standards. Consider, in turn, five key areas: prudential standards, crisis management
mechanisms, trade, taxation and monetary policy.
A first priority is to finalise the financial (prudential) reforms under way
(Chapters V and VI). A core of common minimum standards in the financial sphere
is a precondition for global resilience in an integrated financial world. Such
standards avoid a perilous race to the bottom. The reforms under way are not
perfect, but this is no time to weaken safeguards or add another source of
uncertainty that would hinder the necessary adjustments in the financial industry
(Chapter V).
Among the reforms, completing the agreement on minimum capital and
liquidity standards – Basel III – is especially important, given the role banks play in
the financial system. The task is to achieve agreement without, in the process,
diluting the standards in the false belief that this can support growth. There is
ample empirical evidence indicating that stronger institutions can lend more and
are better able to support the economy in difficult times.11 A sound international
agreement, supported by additional measures at the national level, combined with
the deployment of effective macroprudential frameworks, would also reduce the
incentive to roll back financial integration.
A second priority is to ensure that adequate crisis management mechanisms
are in place. After all, regardless of the strength of preventive measures, international
financial stress cannot be ruled out. A critical element is the ability to provide
liquidity to contain the propagation of strains. And that liquidity can only be
denominated in an international currency, first and foremost the US dollar, given its
dominant global role (Chapters V and VI). At a minimum, this means retaining the
option of activating, when circumstances require, the inter-central bank swap
arrangements implemented post-crisis.
A third priority is to ensure that open trade does not become a casualty of
protectionism. A key to postwar economic success has been increased trade
openness built around the multilateral institutions that support it. Here again, the
arrangements are by no means perfect. It is well known, for instance, that the World
Trade Organization’s global trading rounds have ground to a halt and that its
dispute settlement mechanism is overburdened. Even so, it would be a mistake to
abandon multilateralism: the risk of tit-for-tat actions is simply too great. While
open trade creates serious challenges, rolling it back would be just as foolhardy as
rolling back technological innovation.

20

BIS 87th Annual Report

A fourth, complementary, priority is to seek a more level playing field in
taxation. Tax arbitrage across jurisdictions is one factor that has fuelled resentment
of globalisation and has no doubt contributed to income and wealth inequality
within countries, including by encouraging a race to the bottom in corporate
taxation. Several initiatives have been under way under the aegis of the G20. But
efforts in this area could be stepped up.
Beyond these priorities, it is worth exploring further the room for greater
monetary policy cooperation – the fifth area. As discussed in detail in previous
Annual Reports, its desirability is due to the conjunction of large spillovers from
international-currency jurisdictions with the limited insulation properties of
exchange rates. Cooperation would help limit the disruptive build-up and
unwinding of financial imbalances. In increasing degree of ambition, options
include enlightened self-interest, joint decisions to prevent the build-up of
vulnerabilities, and the design of new rules of the game to instil more discipline in
national policies. While the conditions for tighter forms of cooperation are not
fulfilled at present, deepening the dialogue to reach a better agreement on
diagnosis and remedies is a precondition for further progress.
These courses of action share a thread. They recognise that, just like technology,
globalisation is an invaluable common resource that offers tremendous
opportunities. The challenge is to make sure that it is perceived as such rather than
as an obstacle, and that those opportunities are turned into reality. It is dangerous
for governments to make globalisation a scapegoat for the shortcomings of their
own policies. But it is equally dangerous not to recognise the adjustment costs that
globalisation entails. Moreover, managing globalisation cannot be done just at
national level; it requires robust multilateral governance. For lasting global
prosperity, there is no alternative to the sometimes tiring and frustrating give-andtake of close international cooperation.

II. Political shocks reorient markets

Financial markets in the second half of 2016 and the first half of 2017 were
confronted by a changing political environment as the economic background
brightened. Political events surprised markets, notably the June 2016 vote in the
United Kingdom to leave the European Union (Brexit) and, most of all, the US
presidential election in November. Market participants needed to rapidly take views
on the shifting policy direction in several areas, including trade, taxation and
regulation, and to evaluate the consequences for likely “winners” and “losers”. At
the same time, both growth and inflation picked up in the large economies,
supporting equity and credit markets and pushing up bond yields.
Attention moved away from monetary policy as a driver of markets. One result
was a change to long-established patterns of correlation and risk. Instead of broadbased swings between “risk-on” and “risk-off” positions, investors began to
differentiate more across sectors and countries. Bond yields diverged across the
major economies, with knock-on effects on foreign exchange markets. At the same
time, a gap opened up between surging measures of policy uncertainty and sinking
financial market volatility. That said, until mid-March some indicators suggested
that the perceived risk of large equity market declines had actually increased.

Markets adjust to a new environment
From mid-2016 onwards, the improving growth outlook contributed to rising stock
prices and narrowing credit spreads in major advanced and emerging economies
(Graph II.1, left-hand and centre panels). As growth gathered steam, market volatility
remained very subdued (Graph II.1, right-hand panel), even as policy uncertainty
soared (Box II.B).
Within this broad picture, three phases defined market developments. From
July to October 2016, initial signs of recovery and rising inflation started to boost
advanced economy bond yields, while equity markets were subdued. In November
and December, expectations of shifts in US economic policy sparked a rally in
advanced economy (AE) equities and sharply higher bond yields, while weighing on
some emerging market economy (EME) assets. Finally, in the first half of 2017,
continued good news on growth supported AE and EME equity markets, even as
long bond yields stayed range-bound, against a backdrop of quiescent inflation
indicators and growing doubts about the prospects for large-scale US fiscal
stimulus.
The three phases were demarcated by a series of political tremors. The first was
the outcome of the UK Brexit referendum on 23 June 2016. Major stock indices in
advanced economies fell more than 5% the day after the vote, and the pound
sterling depreciated by 8% against the US dollar. Bond yields also fell initially, as
investors reassessed growth prospects and the near-term monetary policy course
for the United Kingdom and worldwide. But stock prices soon recovered globally.
An initial widening of corporate credit spreads also reversed.
Benchmark bond yields started creeping up in the third quarter. Inflation
indicators in the large advanced economies edged up, and major central banks were
seen as moving closer to the long-anticipated monetary policy normalisation
(Chapter IV). The result was a reversal of the trend towards lower yields that had

been in place since late 2014 (Graph II.2, left-hand panel). The US 10-year yield
reached a low of 1.4% on 8 July, the day data releases showed strong hiring in June.
From then on, it rose steadily, reaching 1.9% on the eve of the presidential election.
The 10-year German bund yield also rebounded, after marking a trough of –0.2% on
8 July. The corresponding Japanese government bond yield, by contrast, did not rise
much after reaching a low point of –0.3% on 27 July. The Bank of Japan’s policy of
maintaining bond yields around zero, introduced in September, kept downward
pressure on long yields even as expected growth and inflation rose. The global stock
of bonds trading at negative yields remained quite high (Graph II.2, centre panel).
Politics delivered another shock to financial markets in November, with the
unexpected US presidential election outcome. Stocks initially plunged on the results,
but in a matter of hours began to rally on expectations of lower corporate taxes,
higher government spending and deregulation. The S&P 500 index gained 5% from
8 November to the end of December, while the STOXX Europe 600 rose 8%. At the
same time, returns diverged across sectors, as market participants sought to identify
winners and losers from the incoming administration’s policies (Graph II.3).
Bond yields rose sharply after the election in anticipation of fiscal stimulus and
a more rapid removal of monetary policy accommodation. The US 10-year yield rose
from 1.9% on 8 November to 2.5% by year-end. The 10-year German bund reached
0.4% in December. Japanese yields did not increase much, however, turning slightly
positive in November. Market commentary began to centre on a “reflation trade”,
betting on an acceleration of growth and rising inflation in the advanced economies.
Higher yields reflected both higher expected short-term interest rates and
rising term premia. Estimated term premia began to rise in the second half of 2016.
While the US 10-year term premium turned positive in December, that for the euro
area remained negative, at about –1 percentage point (Graph II.2, right-hand panel,
and Box II.A).

measured over a longer horizon, such as the 10-year cyclically adjusted price/
earnings ratio (CAPE), were also historically high in the United States.
For EME assets, many of the initial negative reactions to the US election were
reversed in December 2016 and early 2017, as fears of heightened trade tension
receded and stronger global growth came to the fore. Equity valuations in most
EMEs rallied, currencies soared and credit spreads receded (Graph II.7). Still,
divergences across countries remained, with markets focused on areas of continuing
uncertainty, such as geopolitical risks in the case of Korea.
A series of electoral results in Europe reassured markets in the first half of 2017.
European stocks outperformed the S&P 500 in the days following the defeat of
Eurosceptic parties in the Dutch elections in mid-March. In late April and early May
a similar outcome in the French presidential election sparked a rally in equity
markets and a broad-based strengthening of the euro. The French election result
also reversed part of the previous widening in intra-European sovereign spreads
that had stemmed from political worries and concerns about non-performing loans
in some national banking systems (Graph II.8, left-hand panel, and Chapter V). The
outcome of the UK parliamentary elections on 8 June, however, added another
note of uncertainty to markets.
By May 2017, global equity markets were again at or close to record highs and
volatility indicators at historical lows. True, markets experienced occasional shocks,
including geopolitical concerns in the Middle East and the Korean peninsula and a
swirl of legal issues confronting the US presidency. But they proved resilient as
growth remained strong. At the same time, moderate inflation data kept a lid on
bond yields.

The changing nature of market risk
The past year saw shifts in a number of risk relationships that had characterised
financial markets in recent years. One such shift was the fall in correlations of asset
returns across sectors and regions. Another was the growing divergence between

Term premia: concepts, models and estimates

Unconventional monetary policy measures, in particular large-scale government bond purchases, have put the
spotlight on the impact of monetary policy on the term structure of interest rates. One question is how big the
monetary policy impact on long-term bond yields has been, and through which channels. Another, closely related
question concerns the potential magnitude of a correction in bond yields.
One standard way of approaching these questions is to decompose long-term interest rates into an expectations
component and a term premium. Conceptually, the former captures the path of short-term interest rates as priced
in bond markets, while the latter measures the excess return over short-term bonds that risk-averse investors
demand for holding long-term bonds. More recently, the evolution of term premia on long-term government
bonds has received particular attention, both as a proxy measure of the impact of central bank bond purchases (and
balance sheet policies more generally), and as an indicator of snapback risk: to the extent that central bank bond
purchases have compressed term premia, market participants might revert to demanding a “normal” compensation
for holding long-term bonds once they expect such policies to end.
Neither term premia nor the expected path of future short-term interest rates – the two assumed components
of bond yields – are directly observable. Thus, estimates depend crucially on the approach followed and the
additional assumptions made.
One approach is to proxy the expected short rate path with survey measures. A limitation is that surveys are
infrequent and cover only a restricted set of forecast horizons. Nor is it clear that surveys reliably represent market
participants’ actual expectations. More sophisticated techniques model the term structure of interest rates with a
small set of explanatory factors, and then interpret the model forecasts as agents’ expectations of future short-term
rates. In this framework, term premia ensure that the dynamics of the factors driving the yields are consistent with
the pricing of bonds of various maturities prevailing at each point in time, assuming a specific way of pricing the
associated risks. While the most common approach in the literature is to extract the factors exclusively from bond
yields themselves, some researchers have also included survey data on interest rate expectations. Others have

proposed the use of macroeconomic factors, such as measures of inflation and economic activity, in addition to (or
instead of) yield factors, to enable a deeper understanding of the economic drivers of bond yields. Typically, these
macro factors are then linked to the short-term interest rate via an assumed monetary policy rule.
Different modelling choices naturally yield different term premia. This is illustrated in the left-hand panel of
Graph II.A, which plots various estimates of US 10-year term premia together with the 10-year yield itself. These
estimates come from dynamic term structure models: the yield-factor-only model used by the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York (Adrian, Crump and Moench (2013; ACM)); a yield-factor model with additional survey information
used by the Federal Reserve Board (Kim and Wright (2005; KW)); and a macro factor model that also includes survey
information used by the BIS and the ECB (Hördahl and Tristani (2014; HT)). Despite the large uncertainty that
surrounds specific model estimates and the greater variability in the ACM model estimates, the various methods
broadly agree on some key features: a gradual decline in premia over the past 25 years or so, which parallels the
decline in observed yields; very low (and even negative) premia post-crisis; and near zero premia at the current
juncture.
The differences in the term premium estimates across models can be sizeable at times and appear to exhibit
systematic patterns, largely driven by the way the expectations component is constructed (Graph II.A, centre panel).
Overall, this component tends to broadly follow movements at the very short-term end of the yield curve, as
measured by the effective federal funds rate. This co-movement is stronger for the ACM yield-only model, since the
use of survey information by the KW and HT approaches provides a separate anchor for expectations. For example,
following the Lehman collapse in late 2008, the ACM model produces a drop in the average expected US short-term
interest rate of more than 100 basis points, to around 1.5%, and a corresponding surge in the term premium to
more than 3%. In the KW model, the drop is considerably smaller, around 50 basis points, and since the average
expected short-term rate is then stable at around 3% – very close to the level indicated by the survey data – the
plunge in the 10-year yields in late 2010 leads to a sharp drop in the term premium, which turns negative. The HT
model estimate is somewhere in between, arguably owing to the inclusion of macroeconomic information.
Such differences become starker if one compares the cumulative change in yields in the pre- and post-zero
lower bound (ZLB) period (right-hand panel of Graph II.A).p Pre-ZLB, the ACM model attributes all the decline in US
10-year yields to lower expected short rates, resulting in an actual increase in the term premium. While the KW and
HT models also point to a relatively large role for changes in expectations, they instead indicate a decline in the
premium. At the ZLB, the role of changes in term premia increases in all models, but more so in the ACM yield-only
approach.
An additional difference across models relates to their real-time performance. Are the estimates revised as
more observations become available and the parameter estimates updated? Here, the models that include more
parameters or data inputs that are themselves heavily revised, such as estimates of the output gap, are at a
disadvantage.q

  A prerequisite of this decomposition is that agents’ portfolio decisions are based on long-range predictions, rather than on considerations
such as risk management or shorter-horizon expectations. On the conceptual pitfalls in treating the “market” as a “person” with such
attributes, see H S Shin, “How much should we read into shifts in long-dated yields?”, speech at the US Monetary Policy Forum, New York,
March 2017.      The factor dynamics are typically modelled as a low-order vector autoregressive (VAR) process; in addition, it is assumed
that the risks that investors are concerned about are priced in such a way that they depend linearly on the factors. This type of risk-price
assumption gives rise to implied adjusted factor dynamics (so-called “risk-neutral dynamics”, as opposed to the real-world “objective
dynamics”) that are consistent with how bonds are priced in the market.      See eg D Duffie and R Kan, “A yield-factor model of interest
rates”, Mathematical Finance, vol 6, no 4, October 1996, pp 379–406.      See eg D Kim and A Orphanides, “Term structure estimation with
survey data on interest rate forecasts”, Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, vol 47, 2012, pp 241–72.      Examples include
A Ang and M Piazzesi, “A no-arbitrage vector autoregression of term structure dynamics with macroeconomic and latent variables”, Journal
of Monetary Economics, vol 50, no 4, May 2003, pp 745–87; P Hördahl, O Tristani and D Vestin, “A joint econometric model of macroeconomic
and term structure dynamics”, Journal of Econometrics, vol 131, March-April 2006, pp 405–44; and G Rudebusch and T Wu, “A macrofinance model of the term structure, monetary policy and the economy”, The Economic Journal, vol 118, July 2008, pp 906–26.      Detailed
references are given in the sources to Graph II.A.    p  A related issue is how the zero lower bound affects the near-term end of the yield
curve and hence estimates of expected short-term rates and the term premium. While a number of models have been suggested to deal
with the lower bound issue – see eg J Wu and F Xia, “Measuring the macroeconomic impact of monetary policy at the zero lower bound”,
Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, vol 48, pp 253–91 – the term premia implications have not been fully investigated.    q  This is the
case, in particular, of the HT model, which therefore trades off a richer interpretation of the yield curve determinants, more consistent with
the architecture of macroeconomic models, with poorer real-time performance.

measures of market risk and of policy uncertainty. Finally, the expected distribution
of asset returns became increasingly skewed. These changes may point towards an
increased risk of a snapback in key asset prices.

period under review, politically driven developments in other policies played a
greater role, contributing to the fall in correlations.
The second sign of a change in risk relationships was the growing divergence
between historically low market indicators of risk and rising indices of policy
uncertainty (Graph II.8, right-hand panel). There are a number of explanations for
this widening gap (Box II.B). One is that rising political uncertainty contrasted with
greater confidence in the sustainability of the economic upswing. Another, related
explanation is that the prospect of growth- and profit-boosting policy measures
outweighed the uncertainty surrounding them: market participants viewed
manifestations of political risks that would damage growth and profits as tail events.
Indeed, a third development pointing to changes in risk dynamics was
indications that markets did price in tail events. Despite the low level of the VIX,
indicators of risks of large asset price changes trended up from the beginning of
2017. The most popular of these, the CBOE SKEW index, uses out-of-the-money
option prices to measure the risk of large declines in the S&P 500. This index rose
sharply from January until March 2017, then retreated. The RXM, an index that
traces the willingness to profit from large increases in the S&P, rose steadily through
the first five months of 2017 (Graph II.11, left-hand panel).
The expectations of extreme returns have also been reflected in the cost of
buying protection against large moves in exchange rates. Prices of risk reversals on
the US dollar against other currencies suggest that investors were willing to pay
more to protect themselves against a large dollar appreciation against the euro in
the immediate aftermath of the US election (Graph II.11, right-hand panel). As the
dollar weakened in 2017, these indicators retreated.
Evidence for the pricing of tail risks in fixed income markets is less definitive.
Most options trading activity takes place over the counter, so price information is
harder to come by. Nevertheless, some factors may point to a heightened risk of an
unexpectedly large rise – a snapback – in core bond yields, whether priced in or not.

Risk or uncertainty?

The divergence between measures of financial risk and of policy uncertainty featured prominently in the period
under review. The two phenomena are conceptually related. Financial risk traditionally refers to the distribution of
future returns as implied by financial market prices, in particular those of options. Financial risk is higher, the greater
the potential for large price movements, in either direction. By contrast, measures of policy uncertainty typically try
to capture the general degree to which observers are unsure about policy-related economic events.
While implied volatility (as derived from option prices) has become the most prominent measure of financial
risk, policy uncertainty is, by its very nature, more challenging to quantify. Among the various indicators, the Baker,
Bloom and Davis (2016) policy uncertainty index has become quite popular. The US-focused version of the index
has three components: newspaper coverage of uncertainty about economic policy matters; the number of federal
tax code provisions set to expire in future years; and the degree of disagreement among economic forecasters
about future government spending and inflation. Indices that have been compiled for other large economies are
based only on the first of these components.
One possible explanation for the divergence between implied volatility and news-based measures of policy
uncertainty is an amplification mechanism in media reporting: the proliferation of uncertainty-related articles may have
triggered a broader coverage of the topic. Indeed, the rise in the policy uncertainty index since mid-2016 has coincided
with a surge in newspaper articles covering uncertainty (Graph II.B, left-hand panel). By contrast, the index component
that focuses on forecast disagreements has been trending downwards, more closely tracking market volatility.
Other, complementary explanations have to do with financial market prices. Market volatility could be low
because of factors unrelated to risk: prices could be stable, for example, because of abundant liquidity related to

central banks’ quantitative easing policies. Another possibility is that policy uncertainty captures tail risks that may
not significantly affect implied volatilities due to the inherent difficulty in assigning probability to tail events.
Position-taking in volatility-based products, in which activity has grown rapidly in recent years, could be suppressing
the underlying volatility index (Graph II.B, centre panel). Finally, the news-based measures of uncertainty may reflect
concerns that are not yet on market participants’ radar, if their effects play out over a longer horizon.
The divergence between policy uncertainty and market volatility is not unprecedented. Previous bouts of high
policy uncertainty alongside relatively low market volatility occurred in the wake of the early 1990s recession, in the
years after the bursting of the tech bubble and the 9/11 attacks, and in the aftermath of the Great Financial Crisis. In
general, the volatility and policy uncertainty indices appear to have been tightly related and relatively subdued in
periods leading up to crises, and disconnected in the early stages of economic recovery (Graph II.B, right-hand panel).

  S Baker, N Bloom and S Davis, “Measuring economic policy uncertainty”, Quarterly Journal of Economics, vol 131, no 4, pp 1593–636, 2016.

First, market participants have so far been rather sanguine about higher
inflation risks. In particular, bond yields did not rise alongside rallying equity markets
in the first half of 2017. Bond yields could snap back if inflation risks unexpectedly
materialised and participants reconsidered the timing and pace of monetary policy
normalisation, including unwinding central bank balance sheets (Chapter IV).
Second, a number of structural factors may potentially play a role in amplifying
price movements in fixed income markets. One set of drivers relates to the investment
and hedging behaviour of large institutional investors.1 Falling yields in the post-crisis
period led some pension funds and insurers to buy more long-maturity bonds to
match the increased duration of their liabilities. This in turn drove long-term yields
down further.
More generally, low market volatility can foster risk-taking. Some popular
market strategies, such as “risk parity”, implement leveraged portfolio allocations
based on the historical risk profiles of different asset classes. In some cases, a shift
in volatility patterns could mechanically induce asset sales, which would in turn
amplify the volatility spike and drive the market down further.
Perhaps reflecting these or similar mechanisms, there is evidence that in recent
years long-term interest rates have tended to react more sharply to high-frequency
movements in short-term interest rates than before.2 The “taper tantrum” and
“bund tantrum” – when government yields rose unexpectedly sharply in mid-2013
and the first half of 2015, respectively – showed that an aggregate rotation out of
fixed income assets can produce significant temporary dislocations in asset prices,
particularly following a lengthy period of relative market calm.

Pricing anomalies retreat but do not disappear
Even as they reacted to policy shifts and political shocks, financial markets
continued to reflect the impact of longer-term structural changes in technology,
regulatory frameworks and bank business models (Chapter V). Foreign exchange
markets have seen significant shifts in the role of different market players in recent
years, with implications for market depth and resilience (Box II.C). Other markets
have also seen changes to liquidity and pricing dynamics. Some of these changes
have produced persistent pricing anomalies.
International banks’ US dollar funding is one area where structural change has
had an impact on markets. In October 2016, a new set of rules for US prime money
market mutual funds (MMMFs) designed to mitigate systemic risks came into effect
(Chapter V). Starting in late 2015, as banks began to shift their dollar funding

sources in anticipation of the revised rules, these changes affected short-term US
dollar money markets. For example, the spread between US dollar Libor and
overnight index swap (OIS) rates widened throughout 2016 (Graph II.12, left-hand
panel). This spread narrowed once the October deadline passed, but did not return
to its 2015 levels until the second quarter of 2017.
The MMMF reform also contributed to a wider cross-currency basis (Graph II.12,
centre panel). The cross-currency basis indicates the amount by which the interest

Changes in the FX market ecosystem

Daily trading in foreign exchange markets amounted to $5.1 trillion in 2016, according to the BIS Triennial Central
Bank Survey of foreign exchange market activity. For the first time, activity fell relative to the previous survey three
years earlier. Trading by hedge funds and principal trading firms declined, while that by institutional investors
increased significantly. Subdued trade and capital flows, shifts in major central banks’ monetary policies and the
decline in FX prime brokerage were behind many of these trends. These shifts in market players and drivers have
gone hand in hand with a further evolution in FX liquidity provision and changes in FX trade execution (see Chapter V
for a broader discussion of changes to large dealer banks’ business models).
Among dealer banks, there has been a growing bifurcation between the few large institutions still willing to
take risks onto their balance sheets as principals and those that have primarily moved to an agency model of
market-making. Indeed, the 2016 Triennial Survey found that the number of banks accounting for 75% of FX
turnover resumed its trend decline (Graph II.C.1, left-hand panel), while the share of inter-dealer trading picked up
for the first time since the 1995 survey.
As a result, FX market liquidity now flows from a handful of top-tier “core” FX dealer banks to the other
“periphery” banks. This inter-dealer trading pattern marks a change from the classic “hot potato” trading of
inventory imbalances, the main driver of previous trading growth among dealers.  Only a small number of bank
dealers have retained a strong position as so-called “flow internalisers”. Internalisation refers to the process whereby
dealers seek to match staggered offsetting client flows on their own books instead of immediately hedging them in
the inter-dealer market. The 2016 Triennial Survey found that internalisation ratios of FX dealer banks intermediating
large flows and of banks located in the top trading centres are much higher compared with those of other FX
dealers (Graph II.C.1, centre panel).
Dealer banks appear to have focused more on retaining a relationship-driven market structure, where bilateral
OTC transactions dominate, albeit in electronic form. Bilateral trading takes place primarily via proprietary singlebank trading platforms operated by FX dealing banks (Graph II.C.2, left-hand panel), or electronic price streams. This

small set of top global FX dealer banks has faced competition from sophisticated technology-driven non-bank
liquidity providers (Graph II.C.2, centre panel). Some of these have also morphed from pure high-frequency traders
into flow internalisers and have started pricing directly to clients.
While the relationship-driven, direct dealer-customer trading on heterogeneous electronic trading venues
delivers lower spreads in stable market conditions, its resilience to stress is as yet unproven. To be sure, dealers can
internalise large FX flows and quote narrow spreads to their customers in good times. But their need to hedge
inventory risk on an anonymous basis in the inter-dealer market rises sharply in stress episodes (Graph II.C.2, righthand panel). In this sense, anonymous trading venues, such as EBS and Reuters, can be seen as public good
providers. Furthermore, while technology-driven players have also emerged as market-makers and liquidity
providers, the majority of non-bank market-makers often do not bring much risk-absorption capacity to the market.

leg of these instruments and government bond yields, normally positive to reflect
counterparty credit risk, dropped below zero for US dollar contracts in 2015. This
may in part have reflected sales of US Treasuries by EME reserve managers, which
would have pushed Treasury yields upwards. In addition, a supply-demand
imbalance appears to have pushed the rate on the fixed rate leg of the swaps
downwards. On the one hand, the demand to receive fixed rates has risen along
with the volume of fixed income US dollar instruments issued worldwide. On the
other, the large US government-sponsored entities, which before the GFC tended

to pay the fixed rate leg and receive floating rates in dollar swap markets in order
to hedge their portfolios of long-term fixed rate mortgages, are no longer active
participants now that the Federal Reserve has taken over a large share of these
portfolios through its asset purchase programmes. And, as with the CIP anomaly,
large dealer banks are less willing to use their balance sheets to exploit the arbitrage
opportunities created by this imbalance. Spreads on euro-denominated swaps,
which were not subject to these pressures, have widened in the past few years,
perhaps because of pressure on euro government bond yields from the ECB’s asset
purchase programme.5
The interest rate swap anomaly, too, diminished over the period under review
but has not disappeared. The US dollar spread became less negative from mid-2016,
while the euro spread widened further. On the dollar side, rising yields may have
reduced investors’ demand for receive-fixed positions; on the euro side, the ECB’s
asset purchases continued to keep benchmark government yields low.

III. The global economy: maturing recoveries, turning
financial cycles?

The global economy’s cyclical upswing strengthened considerably during the year
under review. By early 2017, virtually all major economies were expanding, and
survey data confirmed the favourable short-term outlook. Slack in advanced
economies shrank, especially in the labour market, and many emerging market
economies (EMEs) benefited from higher commodity prices. Consumption growth
was a key driver of demand, but business investment also showed signs of a
rebound. Financial cycles were in an expansionary phase in many countries,
supporting economic activity. In crisis-hit advanced economies, deleveraging gave
way to financial cycle upswings, while in a number of smaller advanced economies
and EMEs financial booms moderated or, in some cases, turned into downswings.
Despite the brighter near-term outlook, there are medium-term risks to a
sustainable economic expansion. First, leading indicators of financial distress signal
risks from high private debt and house prices in several economies that were not at
the epicentre of the Great Financial Crisis (GFC). Second, in some countries, high
household debt might become a significant drag on demand, especially if rising
interest rates boost debt service burdens. Third, persistent weak productivity
growth and high corporate debt could weigh on investment. Fourth, the rise in
protectionist sentiment could hurt the economic prospects of small open advanced
economies and EMEs in particular.
This chapter first provides an overview of global developments in business and
financial cycles over the past year. Next, it assesses medium-term risks to the
outlook, evaluating aggregate financial cycle risks, the sustainability of consumption
and investment growth, and rising protectionist risks. Finally, it highlights the
window of opportunity that cyclical tailwinds provide to pursue policies that
enhance resilience and sustainable growth.

Macro-financial developments – at inflection points?
The global economy picked up briskly in the second half of 2016, and by early 2017
virtually all major economies were expanding. While, at 3.1%, global growth was
actually slightly lower in 2016 than in 2015, it is expected to rebound to 3.5% in
2017 (Annex Table A1).
Growth in many advanced economies surprised on the upside in the third
quarter of 2016 and remained vigorous well into 2017 (Graph III.1, left-hand panel).
The US economy grew by 1.6% in 2016, but is forecast to expand by 2.1% in 2017.
Euro area GDP increased by 1.7% in 2016, and Japan’s by 1.0%. Despite Brexitrelated uncertainties, the UK economy rolled ahead by 1.8%. The cyclical upswing
continued to push down advanced economies’ unemployment rates, in some cases
to below pre-crisis levels (centre panel).
The growth momentum in EMEs was somewhat weaker than in advanced
economies, but the recovery in energy prices improved the outlook for commodity
exporters. China’s growth edged up from 6.7% in mid-2016 to 6.9% in the first
quarter of 2017, supported by accommodative fiscal policy. India’s growth softened
in the second half of 2016, to 7.0% in the fourth quarter. Higher oil prices
contributed to the growth rebound in oil-exporting countries. Russia’s growth

turned positive in the last quarter of 2016, while Brazil’s downturn seemed to be
bottoming out (Annex Table A1).
Consumption was the key factor driving demand in both advanced economies
and EMEs during 2016. Consumption growth exceeded investment growth by
around half a percentage point in advanced economies and by over 2 percentage
points in EMEs (Graph III.1, right-hand panel). For 2017, investment is forecast to
rebound in both advanced and emerging market economies, alongside continued
consumption growth (right-hand panel, dots). In advanced economies, investment
growth is forecast to overtake consumption growth, while higher commodity prices
should boost capital formation in commodity-exporting countries.
Survey data confirmed the favourable short-term outlook. By early 2017,
consumer confidence in advanced economies had risen further above its historical
average, supporting the consumption-led expansion (Graph III.2, left-hand panel).
Business surveys responded strongly to the favourable macro news in the second
half of 2016. In the United States, expectations of corporate tax cuts and deregulation
played a role. By early 2017, purchasing managers’ indices for manufacturing in the
euro area and Japan were at six- and three-year highs, respectively.
Various factors affecting the investment outlook also turned supportive. Nonfinancial corporations’ profitability picked up in both advanced economies and
EMEs, reversing the declines of previous years (Graph III.2, centre panel). This is
likely to have reinforced the boost from rising equity valuations and reduced
demand uncertainty (right-hand panel). However, policy uncertainty increased
further (Chapter II), probably exerting a dampening effect on investment (Graph III.2,
right-hand panel).
Expectations of shifts in the macroeconomic policy mix also affected the
outlook. Policy announcements pointed to fiscal expansion in the United States just
as the fiscal policy stance was eased elsewhere. In August, the Japanese government
unveiled a fiscal package, including infrastructure spending and transfers. UK

authorities abandoned previous plans to close the budget deficit by 2020. In late
November, the European Commission recommended a fiscal expansion for the euro
area of 0.5% of GDP for 2017. And in mid-December, China’s authorities included
active fiscal policy among the economic priorities for 2017.
Shrinking measures of economic slack suggested that the expansion was
maturing (Graph III.3). To be sure, such estimates should be taken with great
caution, not least because they are frequently subject to large revisions. That said,
capacity constraints appeared increasingly tight, especially based on labour market
indicators, such as the unemployment gap (right-hand panel). By this measure,
most major advanced economies had reached full employment by 2016, and a
further tightening of labour markets was expected in many countries. However,
significant slack seemed to remain in a number of euro area countries, notably Italy
and Spain.
Financial cycles, as represented by credit and property prices, were in the
expansionary phase in many countries, supporting the economic upswing
(Graph III.4).1 The major advanced economies at the epicentre of the GFC continued
on a moderate financial cycle upswing. After several years of growth in real
residential property prices, the ratio of non-financial private credit to GDP edged up
modestly in 2016. This reflected a moderate increase in corporate debt ratios, while
household debt ratios remained flat, following years of decline (Annex Table A2).
Between 2007 and 2016, household debt as a ratio to GDP fell by 18 percentage
points in the United States, 6 percentage points in the United Kingdom and
17 percentage points in Spain, providing room for the consumption-led expansion.
In other advanced economies that were less affected by the GFC, financial booms
moderated. The growth in the private credit ratio slowed by around 6 percentage
points from the previous year, even as property prices continued to rise. The
slowdown mainly reflected weaker corporate debt growth, while household debt

rose further. In Australia, Canada, Sweden and Switzerland, household debt rose by
2–3 percentage points in 2016, to 86–128% of GDP.
Many EMEs experienced slowing financial booms and some outright downturns
in 2016. In aggregate terms, both real house prices and credit relative to output
flattened out. Excluding China, EMEs even experienced a small reduction in their
credit-to-GDP ratio. This reflected, in particular, downturns in Brazil and Russia, with
sustained house price and credit declines (Annex Tables A2 and A3). The corporate
debt ratio fell by 3–5 percentage points in Brazil, India, Korea and Russia, but
increased further in China. These changes followed rapidly rising corporate debt

rose on average by 19 percentage points, most prominently in China (by 70
percentage points to 166% of GDP). Household debt ratios also rose in some EMEs
over the past year, particularly in China and Korea, to 44% and 93% of GDP,
respectively.

Risks to the outlook
While the short-term cyclical outlook is increasingly favourable, there are also a
number of medium-term risks. This section considers four such risks: (i) financial
cycle risks for financial stability; (ii) risks to consumption growth from household
debt; (iii) risks to investment from weak productivity growth and high corporate
debt; and (iv) risks from rising protectionism.

Financial cycle risks
Financial cycles have been a key determinant of macroeconomic dynamics and
financial stability. Peaks in the financial cycle have tended to signal subsequent
periods of banking or financial stress. From this perspective, ongoing or prospective
financial cycle downturns in some EMEs and smaller advanced economies pose a
risk to the outlook.
Such risks can be assessed through early warning indicators of financial distress
(Table III.1). One such indicator is the credit-to-GDP gap, defined as the deviation of
the private non-financial sector credit-to-GDP ratio from its long-term trend.
Another is the debt service ratio (DSR), ie the same sector’s principal and interest
payments in relation to income, measured as deviation from the historical average.
These indicators have often successfully captured financial overheating and
signalled banking distress over medium-term horizons in the past. Since the late
1970s, the critical thresholds (red cells) were breached at some point in the three
years preceding banking distress in more than two thirds of cases, while providing
few false alarms. Lower thresholds (beige cells) captured a larger number of banking
distress episodes but triggered more false alarms.2
Credit-to-GDP gaps have reached levels signalling elevated risks in a number
of EMEs and smaller advanced economies (Table III.1, first column). In particular, the
sizeable credit gaps in several Asian EMEs stand out. In some other EMEs and
advanced economies, credit gaps were also large. Moreover, in most cases large
credit gaps coincided with sizeable (contemporaneous or recent) property price
gaps (asterisks), so that both gap indicators gave a warning signal.
By contrast, DSRs – which can give a better sense of near-term risks over
horizons of one year or so – generally remained below levels that would trigger a
warning signal. Exceptions were a small number of EMEs where debt service
burdens were above their historical norms, even under the assumption of constant
interest rates (Table III.1, second column). However, under more stressed
conditions – an all-else-equal 250 basis point increase in rates with 100% passthrough – DSRs would rise into risky territory for quite a number of economies
(third column).
For EMEs with a heavy foreign currency debt burden, the exchange rate can
amplify financial cycle risks. A large depreciation against major funding currencies,
in particular the US dollar, would inflate debt burdens and could trigger or amplify
financial distress. At 12% of GDP, EME external foreign currency debt was on
average below levels seen before previous financial crises (Graph III.5, left-hand
panel).3 Thus, in general, vulnerabilities arising from foreign currency debt appeared

relatively contained. But at the same time, EMEs have become more integrated into
global financial markets, as reflected, for instance, in greater foreign holdings of
local currency government debt (left-hand panel). As a result, they continue to be
significantly exposed to changes in global investor sentiment.

However, early warning indicators are subject to a number of caveats. On the
one hand, they are not comprehensive: they omit other potential sources of
financial distress, such as sovereign risk. On the other hand, they need to be
interpreted with caution. First, by construction, they balance the risk of issuing false
alarms with that of failing to identify future distress: false positives are inevitable.
Second, although they can capture the general build-up of financial risks, they
cannot identify precisely when the risks will materialise, let alone the intensity of
potential strains. Third, their link with financial crisis risks can change over time.
Importantly, many countries have developed and implemented macroprudential
frameworks to improve financial sector resilience. And, in the wake of the GFC,
major steps have been undertaken globally to enhance regulatory and supervisory
frameworks more generally (Chapter V).
In addition, EMEs have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability to large and
abrupt exchange rate depreciations. They have adopted more flexible exchange
rate regimes and accumulated large FX reserves (Graph III.5, right-hand panel). As a
ratio to GDP, FX reserves have more than tripled since the mid-1990s, reflecting in
particular developments in Asian EMEs (Annex Table A5). Moreover, EME private
foreign asset holdings have risen, providing an additional potential line of defence.
On balance, the analysis suggests that financial cycle risks are material in a
number of economies. Even if, owing to steps to strengthen financial system
resilience, outright financial distress did not emerge, financial cycle downturns
could weaken demand and growth, not least by dampening consumption and
investment.

Box III.A

Excessive household debt and medium-term growth

Excessive indebtedness has been one of the root causes of financial crises and the ensuing deep recessions. In
recent years, the focus has been on household debt, as excessive leverage by the household sector was at the heart
of the Great Financial Crisis.
It is well recognised that household borrowing is an important aspect of financial inclusion and can play useful
economic roles, including smoothing consumption over time. At the same time, rapid household credit growth has
featured prominently in financial cycle booms and busts. For one, household debt – or debt more generally –
outpacing GDP growth over prolonged periods is a robust early warning indicator of financial stress. Furthermore,
there is growing evidence that household indebtedness affects not only the depth of recessions but growth more
generally. In an influential paper, Mian et al (forthcoming) find that an increase in the household debt-to-GDP ratio
acts as a drag on consumption with a lag of several years. BIS research reinforces this conclusion. For instance,
based on a panel of 54 advanced and emerging market economies over the period 1990–2015, Lombardi et al
(2017) find that rising household indebtedness boosts consumption and GDP growth in the short run, but not in the
longer run. Specifically, a 1 percentage point increase in the household debt-to-GDP ratio is associated with growth
that is 0.1 percentage point lower in the long run.
Drehmann et al (2017) shed light on a possible mechanism behind these empirical regularities. When
households take on long-term debt, they increase current spending power but commit to a pre-specified path of
future debt service (interest payments and amortisations). A simple framework captures this accounting
relationship. It highlights two key features. First, if borrowing rises persistently over several years and debt is longterm, as is typically the case, the debt service burden reaches its maximum only after the peak in new borrowing.
The lag can be of several years and increase with the maturity of debt and the degree of persistence in borrowing.
Second, cash flows from lenders to borrowers reach their maximum before new borrowing peaks. They turn negative
before the end of a credit boom, since the positive cash flow from new borrowing is increasingly offset by the
negative cash flow from rising debt service.
Empirically, these simple accounting relationships suggest a transmission channel whereby excessive credit
expansions lead to future output losses. In particular, using a panel of 17 mainly advanced economies from 1980 to

Local projections for a 1 percentage point increase in new household borrowing relative to GDP. The model controls for the lag of real GDP
growth, the real money market rate, the change in the average interest rate households pay on the stock of debt, the spread between the
prime lending rate and the short-term money market rate, real residential property prices, dummy variables for financial crises, a dummy
variable for the Great Financial Crisis in 2009 and country fixed effects. 2 The net effect is the local projection as in the left-hand panel. The
debt service effect is calculated by projecting household borrowing on future debt service and then calculating how this projected level of
debt service affects future GDP. The credit effect is simply the difference between both (see Drehmann et al (2017) for a detailed discussion
of the methodological approach).

2016, Drehmann et al (2017) show that an increase in new debt relative to GDP beyond historical norms provides on
average a boost to GDP growth in the short run but depresses output growth in the medium term (Graph III.A, lefthand panel and black line in the right-hand panel). As the accounting framework suggests, the increase in new debt
feeds into higher debt service burdens. As higher debt service burdens have a strong negative effect on output
going forward, this channel explains almost fully the medium-term growth decline (blue bars, right-hand panel).
However, the negative effects of high credit growth in the medium term are not unconditional. If households initially
have low debt service burdens, additional borrowing continues to be beneficial in the short run without significant
adverse effects later on. This suggests, for instance, that there can be room for benign financial deepening in
countries where households are not yet constrained.
The adverse effects of excessive credit growth can also be magnified by the economy’s supply side response.
For example, banks’ stronger willingness to extend mortgages may feed an unsustainable housing boom and
overinvestment in the construction sector, which may crowd out investment opportunities in higher-productivity
sectors. Borio et al (2016), for example, report evidence that credit booms tend to go hand in hand with a
misallocation of resources – most notably towards the construction sector – and a slowdown in productivity growth,
with long-lasting adverse effects on the real economy.

Risks to consumption
Private consumption has been a key contributor to global demand in the past few
years. However, the main factors that supported consumption growth could weaken
going forward. Given the evidence of diminishing labour market slack, employment
dynamics could turn less supportive. Rising wages might partly compensate for
slower employment growth, but the associated upward pressure on inflation could
lead to tighter monetary policy. At the same time, the consumption boost from
buoyant household credit and asset prices could weaken, especially in countries
with indications of turning financial cycles.
Additional risks to consumption arise from elevated levels of household debt,
in particular given the prospect of higher interest rates. Recent evidence from a
sample of advanced economies suggests that increasing household debt in relation
to GDP has boosted consumption in the short term, but this has tended to be
followed by sub-par medium-term macroeconomic performance (Box III.A). The
main channel appears to be the weight of debt service burdens, which increases
alongside the accumulation of debt and higher interest rates.
It is possible to assess the effect of higher interest rates on debt service burdens
through illustrative simulations. These capture the dynamic relationships between
the two components of the DSR (the credit-to-income ratio and the nominal
interest rate on debt), real residential property prices, real GDP and the threemonth money market interest rate (Graph III.6). Crisis-hit countries, where
households have deleveraged post-crisis, appear relatively resilient to rising interest
rates. In most cases considered, debt service burdens remain close to long-run
averages even in a scenario in which short-term interest rates increase rapidly to
end-2007 levels. By contrast, in countries that experienced rapid rises in household
debt over recent years, DSRs are already above their historical average and would
be pushed up further by higher interest rates. This could act as a significant drag
on consumption and output (Box III.A).4

Rapid tightening

Deviations from country-specific long-run averages. Projections for debt service ratios for the household sector given four interest rate
scenarios: market-implied (three-month money market rates evolve in line with market-implied rates); constant rates (three-month money
market rates remain constant); 2004 tightening (absolute changes in three-month money market rates follow the 2004 tightening episode);
rapid tightening (three-month money market rates rise to end-2007 levels within eight quarters and remain fixed thereafter). Projections are
based on a country-specific VAR containing as endogenous variables the credit-to-income ratio for the household sector, interest rates on
the stock of household debt, real residential property prices and real GDP. The three-month money market rate is included as an exogenous
variable. The VAR is estimated on quarterly data for the period 1990–2016; projections start in Q4 2016 for AU, NO and US, and in Q1 2017
otherwise.

To be sure, as the simulations embed the historical interactions since 1990 in
reduced form, they provide only an initial gauge of the underlying dynamics. For
instance, a long period of unconventional monetary policy could have altered the
interactions between the variables. Moreover, the rapid tightening scenario is
probably not very likely and might trigger macroeconomic dynamics different from
those captured by historical relationships. That said, the results point to headwinds
in some economies were interest rates to rise significantly.

Risks to investment
A rotation from consumption- to investment-led growth would support the mediumterm sustainability of the current upswing. A higher stock of productive capital
enhances growth potential and alleviates capacity constraints, helping to prevent a

50

BIS 87th Annual Report

build-up of inflationary pressures. Indeed, consumption-led expansions – defined as
private consumption growing more rapidly than output – appear to be less durable
than those driven by other components of demand. Evidence for advanced
economies indicates that consumption-led growth heralds below-average output
growth down the road (Graph III.7, left-hand panel). One potential factor is excessive
accumulation of household debt, as discussed above.5 Another is weak investment
activity and thus a slow accumulation of productive capacity (right-hand panel).
Recent signs of an investment rebound have followed protracted weakness
post-crisis in the advanced economies and a slowdown of investment growth in the
EMEs more recently. In advanced economies, the ratio of real investment to real
GDP, which accounts for changes in the relative price of investment goods, fell by
around 3 percentage points to just below 20% in the immediate aftermath of the
crisis (Graph III.8, left-hand panel). This drop reflected in part the correction
observed in residential investment after the pre-crisis boom, but also a decline of
the non-residential component. In EMEs, investment ratios rose throughout the
crisis, driven in particular by strong expansion in China, but started to level off after
2013. Several factors were at work, including adverse terms-of-trade changes for
commodity exporters, a slowdown in FDI flows to non-commodity exporters and
an investment slowdown in China.6
Weaker investment in recent years has coincided with a slowdown in
productivity growth. Since 2007, productivity growth has slowed in both advanced
economies and EMEs (Graph III.8, centre panel). One potential factor behind this
decline is a persistent misallocation of capital and labour, as reflected by the
growing share of unprofitable firms. Indeed, the share of zombie firms – whose
interest expenses exceed earnings before interest and taxes – has increased
significantly despite unusually low levels of interest rates (right-hand panel).7

Another factor holding back productivity appears to be a stagnant diffusion of new
technology.8 At the same time, low investment and weak productivity growth are
likely to reinforce each other: investment can raise productivity through capital
deepening and embedded technological progress, while higher productivity can
boost the returns on investment. Persistent weak productivity growth could
therefore cloud the medium-term investment outlook.
Looking ahead, several other factors could weigh on investment. One, as
already noted, is policy uncertainty, should it persist. Another is demographic
change. Slower population growth should weaken aggregate demand, although it
could also reinforce the need for labour-saving capital investment to compensate
for a shrinking labour force. A third factor is high corporate debt.
Over the past 10 years, there has been a close positive correlation between the
growth of corporate credit and investment (Graph III.9, left-hand panel). A build-up
of corporate debt has financed investment in many economies, particularly in EMEs,
including high investment rates in China. Turning financial cycles in these economies
could therefore weigh on investment.
As with consumption, the level of debt can affect investment. Rising interest
rates would push up debt service burdens in countries with high corporate debt.
Moreover, in EMEs with large shares of such debt in foreign currency, domestic
currency depreciation could hurt investment. As mentioned before, an appreciation
of funding currencies, mainly the US dollar, increases debt burdens where currency
mismatches are present and tightens financial conditions (the exchange rate risktaking channel).9 Empirical evidence suggests that a depreciation of EME currencies
against the US dollar dampens investment significantly (Graph III.9, right-hand
panel), offsetting to a large extent the positive impact of higher net exports.10

Risks from rising protectionism
A broader risk for the current expansion is protectionism. The reduction in overall
trade tariffs has slowed over the past decade (Graph III.10, left-hand panel).

How sensitive are US production costs to tariffs on imports from China
and Mexico?

Box III.B

Barriers to trade can reduce the competitiveness of domestic industries as internationally sourced inputs become
more expensive and firms cannot substitute away easily. Moreover, in the global network of input-output trade,
tariffs targeted at specific trade partners also inevitably affect other economies that supply inputs to them.
It is possible to illustrate the propagation of protectionist measures via global value chains (Graph III.B, lefthand panel). The hypothetical example is a shock to US sectoral production costs resulting from a hypothetical tariff
of 10% on imports originating from China and Mexico.
Both direct and indirect effects are at play. The direct effects result from bilateral links (Graph III.B, red and blue
bars in the left-hand panel). If, say, 10% of the cost of a given industry were due to inputs sourced from Mexico, a
10% import duty would increase total production costs by 1%. The indirect effects capture the impact on the rest of
the production network, as US sectors source from each other and the rest of the world (yellow bars). For example,
if a tariff increases the cost of oil imports from Mexico, US production costs of goods, such as chemicals or plastics
that use oil as an input, increase. And the tariff would also have higher-round effects via subsequent nodes of the
production chain, as chemicals and plastics are, in turn, used as inputs into production.
Overall, this simulation reveals a comparatively large sensitivity of US production costs to tariffs on imports
from Mexico or China. To put the resulting cost shocks in context, the centre panel of Graph III.B displays the
reduction in US wages that would be required to fully compensate for the increasing costs of imported inputs. For
example, such tariffs would lead to a 0.86% cost increase in the US transportation industry. To fully offset this
increase, US labour costs would have to decrease by around 6%, satisfying 0.86% – 6% * 0.14 ≈ 0, where 0.14 is the
labour cost share in the US transportation equipment industry.

Third countries would also be affected. Mexico and China are important entry points for intermediate goods,
which are further processed and then shipped to the United States. The right-hand panel of Graph III.B shows the
share of foreign value added that is embodied in exports from Mexico (red bars) and China (blue bars) by origin. For
example, intermediate goods and services sourced from Japan account for 2.4% of the value of Mexican exports
and for 4.7% of the value of Chinese exports. If exports from China and Mexico decrease by $1 billion, demand for
Japanese inputs decreases by $47 million and $24 million, respectively.

Moreover, trade-restrictive measures, such as regulations and targeted tariff hikes,
have risen substantially since end-2010 (centre panel). And a greater emphasis on
measures that would hinder free trade in national policy agendas suggests that the
risk of protectionism may be growing further.
A rise in protectionism would add to the cyclical and structural factors that have
held back global trade post-crisis (Graph III.10, right-hand panel and Chapter VI).
These have included: aggregate demand weakness, especially in trade-intensive
business investment; income-driven demand shifts, notably from manufacturing
goods to less traded services; and the maturing of the Chinese economy, which has
boosted domestically produced intermediate inputs at the expense of imported ones.
Protectionism could hurt growth and welfare through various channels
(Chapter VI). One is slower productivity growth due to reduced competition and a
more constrained international division of labour. Another is weaker competitiveness
of domestic industries: internationally sourced inputs would become more expensive
and would not be easily substituted with domestic ones. And global value chains
(GVCs) represent a potentially powerful amplification mechanism. Costs from trade
barriers would propagate both nationally and internationally through production
chains (Box III.B).
Rising protectionism could also exacerbate the risks to the medium-term
outlook discussed earlier. To the extent that it reduced profits and incomes, it would
weaken corporate and household balance sheets, sap debt servicing capacity and
heighten financial cycle risks. The balance sheet effects, in turn, could be a drag on
global demand, amplified by policy and economic uncertainty. Protectionism could
hit import-intensive business investment and FDI particularly hard, further retarding
technological diffusion. Such effects are also relevant for economies where a high
degree of competitiveness has fostered rapid export growth and rising incomes in
the recent past.

Cyclical tailwinds open a window of opportunity
The favourable short-term outlook presents a valuable opportunity to pursue
policies conducive to sustainable long-term growth. The general goal of such
policies would be to lift the economy’s growth path and counter the trend towards
weaker productivity growth. One precondition for achieving this goal is
strengthening the economy’s resilience, including its capacity to cope with shocks,
to contain the build-up of financial cycle risks and other financial imbalances, and
to adapt to structural changes in the global economy.
A policy mix rebalancing towards structural policies would help revive
productivity and sustain the investment recovery. Indeed, the pace of labour
productivity-enhancing reforms appears to have slowed notably during 2015–16.11
This contrasts with somewhat better progress in reforms aimed at boosting labour
utilisation, as reflected in the favourable employment performance during the
recent upturn.

BIS 87th Annual Report

55

One relevant set of structural policies includes measures to increase business
dynamism. More efficient bankruptcy procedures can reduce the strain on resources
and productivity caused by unviable enterprises. And removing administrative red
tape can encourage the entry of productive firms.
Fiscal policy can also play an important role. It can generally support structural
adjustment, notably measures to increase the labour and product markets’ ability
to reallocate resources. Moreover, the composition of fiscal expenditures could be
adjusted to favour investment in both human (eg education) and physical
(eg infrastructure) capital. And tax systems could be streamlined and made more
growth-friendly and resilience-enhancing. One example is shifting from direct to
consumption-based taxation. Another is reducing the widespread debt bias in tax
codes. In evaluating such policies, it is important to recognise that in many
countries the fiscal room for manoeuvre is rather limited due to high debt burdens
(Annex Table A4), pointing to the need for long-term fiscal consolidation.12
Moreover, interest rate normalisation could further reduce fiscal space. This
suggests that changes in the composition of expenditures and taxes are superior to
deficit-boosting measures, especially in countries where economic slack is limited.

IV. Monetary policy: inching towards normalisation

Monetary policy continued to be generally very accommodative in the year under
review. The Federal Reserve quickened its pace of policy rate normalisation while
the Bank of Japan and ECB maintained their expansionary stances. Many other
advanced economy and emerging market economy (EME) central banks kept
policy rates range-bound near historical lows. Even so, the prospects for a gradual
withdrawal of accommodation grew against the backdrop of a strengthening global
recovery, firming global labour markets and maturing financial cycles.
Monetary policy normalisation assumed greater prominence as the US policy
rate edged further upwards and other central banks, notably the ECB, began
to consider the issue more actively. The pace is generally expected to be even
more gradual and predictable than in the past. But calibrating it is not without
challenges. Normalising too slowly would raise the perennial concern of central
banks that they will fall behind the curve and have to catch up in a disruptive
fashion. Normalising too quickly would raise the risk of short-circuiting the recovery.
Either way, policy normalisation in the major advanced economies will have farreaching implications domestically and internationally. Compounding the challenge
are the asynchronous nature of the normalisation across economies and high debt
levels globally.
After reviewing monetary policy decisions over the past year, this chapter
examines the evolving inflation outlook, with a special focus on global labour
markets. It then discusses normalisation challenges, highlighting price and financial
stability trade-offs and the policy options available to address them.

Recent developments
Nearly a decade after the outbreak of the Great Financial Crisis (GFC), policy rates
continued to sit near historical lows, with geopolitical events prompting some
additional easing in mid-2016 (Graph IV.1, left-hand panel). While the total size of
central bank balance sheets reached new heights (Graph IV.1, centre panel), the
trajectories followed by individual central banks were quite diverse. All this occurred
as the global recovery gained traction, financial market conditions tightened
somewhat, and inflation picked up in advanced economies while edging down on
average in EMEs (Graph IV.1, right-hand panel).

Global monetary policy in transition
Monetary policy divergence among the major advanced economies widened
during the year while real policy rates stayed at or near historical lows (Graph IV.2).
In the United States, the withdrawal of monetary accommodation resumed
after a year-long pause, with two 25-basis point increases in the federal funds rate
target range. The increases reflected improved labour market conditions, greater
optimism about the recovery’s strength and confidence that inflation was moving
back to its 2% target over the medium term. The Federal Reserve continued to
anticipate a gradual policy rate normalisation over the next few years, along with a
drawdown of its enlarged balance sheet once policy rate normalisation is ”well
under way”. US policymakers also revised down the (median) projection for the

long-run level of the federal funds rate to 3%, down after many revisions from
4.25% in 2012, reflecting views about a decline in the “natural” rate (see below).
The ECB kept its key policy rates unchanged – with the main refinancing rate at
0% and the deposit facility rate at –0.4% – so as to sustain a very substantial degree
of accommodation. The ECB cited subdued inflationary pressures and mixed
economic and financial prospects as its key reasons for keeping rates low for long.
It also announced an extension of its asset purchase programme through at least
December 2017. However, with deflation risks receding and economic growth
prospects improving, it ratcheted down the pace of asset purchases in April from
€80 billion to €60 billion per month.
The Bank of Japan modified its large-scale monetary easing programme,
labelled QQE (quantitative and qualitative monetary easing), with yield curve
control. The new features included targeting the 10-year Japanese government
bond yield, currently set at about 0%, and a commitment to overshoot the inflation
target for a while. The –0.1% rate on policy rate balances remained unchanged.
The new approach addressed concerns that the prospect of higher global longterm yields could put unwelcome upward pressure on Japanese bond yields. The
Bank of Japan coupled the approach with an expansion of its US dollar-supplying
programme and purchases of exchange-traded funds.
Central banks outside the major advanced economies faced a diverse set of
challenges. Overall, policy rate moves were few. Inflation developments dominated
decisions, as inflation generally became better aligned with targets.
Many central banks held policy rates unchanged as they balanced competing
risks (Graph IV.3, left-hand panel). On the one hand, the strengthening global
recovery and, in particular, tightening labour markets in many economies suggested
a need for higher rates in the near term. With respect to financial stability, high and
growing credit-to-GDP ratios and housing prices continued to weigh on decisions
in some economies. And inflation deviations from target shrank as the effects of
past commodity price declines and exchange rate swings largely ran their course.

or somewhat lower rates. While the People’s Bank of China cited several of these
factors as it kept the official benchmark deposit and lending rates unchanged, it
did nudge up rates on its open market operations and medium-term liquidity
facilities. The Czech National Bank, while leaving policy rates unchanged,
discontinued its exchange rate floor in April as inflation turned upwards and gained
momentum.
For central banks that reduced rates, the cuts took place largely in response to
inflation news. Brazil and Indonesia slashed rates by 3.0 and 1.75 percentage points,
respectively, after significant declines in inflation towards target alongside a

relatively stable exchange rate. Colombia and Chile also experienced some relief
from above-target inflation, which fell faster than expected as financial conditions
tightened in late 2016. The Reserve Banks of Australia and New Zealand lowered
policy rates to historical lows on subdued inflation, continued lacklustre growth
and exchange rate concerns, despite long-standing financial stability risks.
The Bank of England and Reserve Bank of India eased policy in response to
significant domestic political decisions. In the aftermath of the UK referendum on
EU membership, the Bank of England cut its policy rate by 25 basis points, the
first move in over seven years. It cited potential adverse economic and financial
effects from Brexit. At the same time, the bank introduced a new round of bond
purchases, raising the size of its asset purchase programme from £375 billion to
£435 billion. The Reserve Bank of India also lowered its policy rate by 25 basis
points, although inflation remained comfortably within the target range.
Demonetisation of large-denomination rupee bills raised the risk that economic
activity might be affected.
Central banks that raised rates did so in large part to address exchange rate
developments. The Bank of Mexico and the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey
lifted rates as sharp currency depreciations increased the likelihood that inflation
would run substantially above target, unanchoring expectations.

The evolving inflation outlook
One major theme during the year was the evolving inflation outlook. Inflation
headwinds from past commodity price declines eased appreciably. Tighter labour
markets showed signs of exerting upward pressure on wages and prices, raising
questions about whether further tightening could lead to a stronger effect on
inflation.

Inflation edged higher globally
Global inflation edged up to 2.5% (Graph IV.4, left-hand panel). Both near-term
and cyclical inflation drivers played significant roles. Commodity prices ticked up.
Exchange rates stabilised. Shrinking output gaps and generally tighter labour
markets reflected the cumulative effect of the long-lived moderate global
recovery. For many central banks, inflation objectives appeared increasingly within
reach, as reflation pressures helped close the gap between actual and target
inflation.
Among the near-term, proximate inflation determinants, commodity prices
supported a pickup. For example, the oil price headwinds of the previous two years
eased significantly (Graph IV.4, centre panel). As a result, headline inflation drew
closer to core inflation, and deflation risks fell (Graph IV.4, right-hand panel). Nearterm inflation expectations also increased, notably those reflected in professional
forecaster surveys in a number of economies.
The smaller deviations of inflation from target also reflected continued
improvements in cyclical demand. Measures of slack shrank further. While output
slack estimates still suggest modest spare capacity in some economies,
unemployment rates fell close to, if not below, rates previously deemed consistent
with long-run price stability (Chapter III).1 In addition, central banks and private
forecasters expected additional tightening of labour markets (Graph IV.5, left-hand
panel), pointing to possible further increases in underlying inflation ahead (see
below). Reinforcing these developments, producer price inflation rose considerably
(Graph IV.5, centre panel).

In spite of the reflation, long-run inflation expectations remained well
anchored. As in earlier years, survey-based measures ran well within most central
banks’ target ranges (Graph IV.5, right-hand panel). In addition, market-based
measures of long-run inflation expectations recovered somewhat from lows in the
previous year, suggesting that concerns about deflation risks have faded. As
discussed in the 86th Annual Report, questions were raised about the reliability of
these market measures, owing to significant time-varying liquidity and term premia
as well as an undue sensitivity to short-term oil price fluctuations (Chapter II).
Nevertheless, central banks took some comfort in seeing these measures turn
upwards.
Despite the moderate near-term and cyclical reflationary forces at work, secular
factors, such as globalisation and technology, seemingly continued to work in the
opposite direction. The 86th Annual Report raised the possibility that improvements
in technology and expanding global value chains (GVCs) have held down price
pressures in past decades. These supply side forces generate “good” disinflationary
headwinds. The levelling-off of globalisation in recent years, as documented in
Chapter VI, has raised the question whether the headwinds have moderated, possibly
contributing to the upward tilt in the inflation outlook.

Are labour markets signalling rising inflationary pressures?
Global labour markets have seen profound changes over the past decades, with
significant implications for wage and price formation. As labour market slack
diminishes, wage growth is expected to rise. But wage demands have lagged the
cycle more than in the past. Rather than a purely cyclical phenomenon, this wage

economy. The question for many central banks is whether these developments
have so weakened the relationship between inflation and labour market slack
that the recent tightening of labour markets poses little threat of an inflation
overshoot.

Long-term forces behind labour’s declining pricing power
Subdued wage growth is a sign of labour’s declining “pricing” power. While a number
of factors have contributed to this development, two deserve special attention.
One factor has been the dramatic expansion of the global labour force. In the
1990s and early 2000s, the opening-up of Asia and the former Soviet bloc roughly
doubled the effective labour force involved in world trade.1 More recently, further
economic integration and increasing participation in GVCs have boosted
international competition in labour markets.
A second factor has been industrial automation. New technologies have long
been a significant influence on production processes and demand for skilled labour
in advanced economies. With the quickening pace and growing versatility of
current robotic technologies, manufacturing labour pools face new challenges. At
the same time, service sector employment, traditionally less exposed to the
increased efficiency of robotics, has also become more vulnerable. Automating
knowledge work through software advances and new information technologies has
continued to boost the size and scope of global service providers, broadening the
range of service jobs that are threatened with obsolescence.2
Labour’s lower pricing power is consistent with the decline in labour’s income
share in many advanced economies (Graph IV.6, left-hand panel). And it may

also help explain why wages have not always kept up with productivity trends

(Graph IV.6, right-hand panel). At the same time, of course, these trends have not
affected all sectors equally, and reflect a multiplicity of other factors, too.3

Implications for wage growth and inflation
These profound changes in labour markets may also have far-reaching implications
for inflation. One reason why labour markets have traditionally been regarded as
key for inflation is that wage increases lead to rising production costs and hence
higher prices, which may in turn reinforce wage demands – so-called second-round
effects. After all, wage costs account for the bulk of production costs, especially in
the service sector. The more workers can strengthen their pricing power, the more
likely it is that wage demands will be accommodated. Thus, a secular decline in
pricing power can shed light on the question of how far the recent tightening of
global labour markets points to a build-up in inflation momentum.
Analysing this question requires a number of links to be considered: the
relationship between wage pressures and production costs, ie unit labour costs
(ULCs); that between labour costs and measures of economic slack; and finally that
between ULCs and inflation. The picture that emerges is a mixed one.
Wage growth is not necessarily inflationary: whenever it is supported by
productivity gains, it will not lead to rising production costs. This is why ULC growth
is a better, if still imperfect, measure of incipient inflationary pressures. At the current
juncture, advanced economy ULCs are expected be held in check by somewhat faster
productivity growth, despite stronger earnings growth (Graph IV.7, left-hand panel).
There is also some evidence that the link between ULC growth and domestic
labour market slack has weakened over the years (centre panel in Graph IV.7), but
remains significant. The secular decline in labour’s pricing power appears to have
played a role (Box IV.A). Other evidence points to the real economy’s globalisation
as a force behind this decline: a country’s ULC growth has become more correlated
with global ULC growth, weighted by the country’s value added trade (Box IV.B).

ChIV_allGraphsTables_Editing.docx

65

This also suggests that an exclusive focus on domestic developments could
underestimate inflationary pressures, now that ULCs are rising globally.
The consequences of ULC developments for prices are somewhat less clear. To
be sure, ULC growth and inflation appear to co-move closely in the long run.4 In
addition, there is evidence of a link at cyclical frequencies (Graph IV.7, right-hand
panel). That said, the link has become weaker and has been, at times, unstable and
elusive. Given the predictive content of ULC growth for future price inflation, the
empirical evidence points to a weak pass-through of labour costs to inflation.5 This
impression is reinforced by the difficulties in finding a significant response of inflation
to domestic output or labour slack – the price Philips curve looks rather flat.6
Since the GFC, a number of factors may have clouded the picture further. Some
of them suggest that underlying wage cost pressures may have been overestimated.
For instance, previously discouraged workers may have re-entered the labour force
and hence expanded the ranks of job-seekers (officially unemployed), suggesting
that more slack may exist in the labour market than headline figures indicate.
Indeed, over the past decade not all of the decline in the participation rate in some
countries can be attributed to secular demographic trends, such as ageing.7
Other factors may have weakened the relationship between slack and wage
growth only temporarily. Wage gains may have been unusually weak simply
because of the depth of the recession and nominal wage rigidities.8 With inflation
having eroded real wage gains since then, wage pressure might revive if inflation
continues to increase as slack diminishes. For instance, wage norms, which provide
an orientation for such demands, fell to roughly 2% post-crisis, well below the 3–4%
that was typical pre-crisis.9 Indeed, early signs of such a return are visible in the
more cyclically sensitive sectors, eg the rise in part-time wage growth.

Exploring the wage Phillips curve

Ever since William Phillips published his seminal paper in 1958, a wide body of research has emphasised the role
of economic slack in driving inflation in prices and wages. However, recent evidence suggests that the ability of
price Phillips curves to explain inflation has declined (see Chapter III of the 84th Annual Report). What about the
impact of economic slack on wages?
A conventional wage Phillips curve specification embodies the view that unit labour cost (ULC) growth (wage
inflation, Δwi,t , adjusted for labour productivity growth, Δlpi,t ) is driven by labour market slack, xi,t with a sensitivity
β:
൫ȟ‫ݓ‬௜ǡ௧ െ ȟ݈‫݌‬௜ǡ௧ ൯ ൌ ݇ ൅ ܿ௜ ൅ ߨത௜ǡ௧ିଵ ൅ ߚ‫ݔ‬௜ǡ௧ ൅ ݁௜ǡ௧ .

For a G7 panel from 1960 to 2016, the relationship between ULC growth and slack (proxied by the unemployment
gap (Graph IV.A, right-hand panel)) is found to be negative and statistically significant. The estimate of β indicates
that a 1 percentage point decline in slack increases ULC growth by roughly 0.9 percentage points (red line, Graph IV.A,
left-hand panel).
One possible driver of a changing sensitivity of ULCs to slack conditions is the increased contestability of
markets associated with the trend decline in workers’ pricing power. To explore this possibility, a measure of pricing
power (denoted zi,t ) is constructed by applying the method of principal components to changes in three indicators
of relevant labour market conditions: employment protection, union coverage and union density (Graph IV.A, centre
panel). An augmented Phillips curve model is then estimated, where the sensitivity of ULC growth to slack conditions,
βi,t depends on each country’s zi,t :

The estimated parameter γ is positive and significant, indicating that the lower pricing power has indeed
reduced the sensitivity of ULCs to domestic labour slack – the average slope of the wage Phillips curve has become
flatter across countries (blue line, Graph IV.A, left-hand panel). Even so, the time-varying Phillips curve slope has

All told, these considerations point to some reflationary tilt in the inflation
outlook but not to major inflationary risks. At the same time, domestic and global
labour market conditions deserve close monitoring, as purely domestic indicators
of slack, be it in the labour or goods markets, do not appear to be fully adequate in
gauging inflationary pressures.10

Start of the Great Unwinding?
Policy normalisation has never been a question of “if” but rather of “when, how fast
and to what level”. These questions gained prominence in the past year, as the case
for prolonged accommodation weakened and several central banks turned their
attention to the process of normalisation. Currently, markets expect rates to rise
very gradually (Graph IV.8, left-hand panel), as bloated central bank balance sheets
are trimmed. Yet such expectations contrast sharply with past episodes of rising
rates, which were typically much less gradual (Graph IV.8, second panel).
In determining the pace of normalisation, central banks must indeed strike a
delicate balance. On the one hand, there is a risk of acting too early and too rapidly.
After a series of false dawns in the global economy, questions linger about the
durability of this upswing. And the unprecedented period of ultra-low rates heightens
uncertainty about reactions in financial markets and the economy. On the other
hand, there is a risk of acting too late and too gradually. If central banks fall behind
the curve, they may at some point need to tighten more abruptly and intensively to
keep the economy from overheating and inflation from overshooting. And even if
inflation does not rise, keeping interest rates too low for long could raise financial
stability and macroeconomic risks further down the road, as debt continues to pile
up and risk-taking in financial markets gathers steam. How policymakers address
these trade-offs will be critical for the prospects of a sustainable expansion.
Views about the end-point and initial economic conditions will naturally
influence the shape and pace of the normalisation process. It is worth considering
in more detail the issues that each of these aspects raises.
A key question about the end-point is the level towards which the policy rate
should be expected to gravitate. Central banks use a number of approaches to form
a judgment about this, rather than simply extrapolating the decline in rates over
time (Graph IV.8, third panel). One approach is to interpret what financial markets
are pricing in, by deriving from bond yields what “markets think” the appropriate
rate will be in the future (Chapter II). Another is to use modelling tools to estimate
the end-point, defined as the “equilibrium” interest rate that balances the economy
– sometimes also known as the “natural rate”.11 Both approaches would generally
point to real (inflation-adjusted) short-term rates in the region of 0 to 2%. With the
addition of target inflation of around 2%, this results in nominal rates of between 2
and 4%.12 Alternative yardsticks, for example, based on the trend in global per

The increasing international co-movement of labour costs

Labour cost developments have become increasingly synchronised across countries over the past two decades. This
general trend is reflected in the growing statistical power of global ULC growth in explaining domestic ULC growth
– measured by the R2 in a rolling-window regression for 15 countries from Q2 1995 to Q4 2016 (Graph IV.B, lefthand panel). The R2 values are measured using a stacked country regression approach. From roughly 12% at the
start of the sample, the R2 almost doubles to about 22% by the end of the sample period. The only pause in this
trend occurred shortly after the GFC, which had varied effects on labour markets across the globe.
The growing importance of global ULC growth can be inferred by looking at the country-specific R2 values for
the two subsamples Q2 1995–Q4 2005 and Q1 2006–Q4 2016 (centre panel). The explanatory power of the statistical
relationship has increased for all countries, quite substantially in some cases.
The increasing global co-movement of ULCs is likely to have resulted from greater economic integration.
Economic globalisation has fostered greater substitutability not only of intermediate and final goods and services
but also of labour across countries. In particular, the rapid expansion of global value chains in past decades has
resulted in greater competitiveness in price and wage setting across countries (right-hand panel). For labour, this
has meant more exposure to global competition, directly through trade and indirectly through the threat that
production might be shifted elsewhere within global supply chains.

capita growth to estimate the real rate, would suggest somewhat higher figures, of
about 5% in nominal terms (Graph IV.8, right-hand panel).
Unfortunately, none of these approaches is very reliable. Market prices can at
best act as a sounding board, given the technical pitfalls in extracting information
from them (Chapter II). Prices are strongly influenced by central banks, and the
views of market participants embedded in them may well be wrong, as has often
been the case in the past. In addition, since the equilibrium rate is unobservable,
the outcome of model-based approaches hinges crucially on the assumptions
made. Moreover, just as with estimates of economic slack, estimates of the natural
rate are subject to significant revisions as time passes. Thus, it is not obvious how
much guidance central banks can find in these highly uncertain estimates.
In practice, therefore, central banks have little alternative but to move without
a firm end-point in mind, guided purely by the evolution of the economy and
perceived trade-offs. Perceived trade-offs are indeed critical. Users of analytical
frameworks that place more emphasis on inflation and short-term output will tend
to put more weight on the risk of doing too much too early; those that place more
emphasis on financial stability and the financial cycle will be more concerned about
the risk of doing too little too late, as they would focus more on the potential side
effects of keeping interest rates low for too long.13
The economic conditions at the start of the normalisation journey naturally
encourage caution, as they will greatly heighten uncertainty about how financial
markets and the economy will react. In particular, financial markets will need to
adjust after an exceptionally long period of dependence on ultra-easy monetary
conditions. And the global economy is threatened by a global debt overhang, as
the ratio of debt to GDP has continued to rise post-crisis. Normalisation will test the
economy’s ability to tolerate higher rates: private sector expenditures may falter 14.06.2017 12:06

and fiscal positions prove more vulnerable than anticipated.

BIS 87th Annual Report

Caution is normally interpreted to mean gradualism and transparency. Gradualism
allows central banks to test the waters, seeking to avoid abrupt market adjustments
and policy reversals. Transparency about the future policy path aims to remove one
important source of uncertainty. Transparency may also go hand in hand with the
gradual release of information about that path, in order to avoid sudden asset price
adjustments, given the markets’ tendency to telescope the future into today’s prices.
But gradualism and transparency are no panacea. Gradualism naturally increases
the risk of falling behind the curve, be it in terms of the build-up of inflationary
pressures or of debt globally. And transparency about the path of central bank
measures may unintentionally encourage greater risk-taking in markets. By reducing
the uncertainty surrounding the announced path and hence compressing risk
premia, transparency may induce market participants to leverage up in their search
for yield.14 The experience of the 2004–06 episode of raising the federal funds rate
“at a measured pace” seems consistent with this possibility. In addition, risk-taking
would be strengthened by any perception that the central bank would step in to
calm short-term volatility and adverse market moves. Nor is there much the central
bank can do to avoid the shock-amplifying mechanisms that stem from individual
firms’ risk management strategies, such as duration matching by long-term investors
(Chapter II).15
Thus, the combination of gradualism and transparency raises a dilemma. It can
certainly dampen volatility in the short run. But, if pushed too far, it may raise the
risk of a larger adjustment and unwinding in the longer run. Obvious examples
include a snapback in bond yields (Chapter II) and broader debt- or inflation-related
macroeconomic strains (Chapter III). More specifically, market dynamics may take on
the attributes of a binary outcome, where the “risk-on” phases are punctuated by
“risk-off” phases, rather than evolving smoothly. In the worst case, the central bank’s
choice may be between a sharper snapback after a longer lull and a smaller
snapback after a shorter lull, rather than between a smooth and a turbulent exit.
This dilemma is especially visible in the context of balance sheet policies – how
central banks decide to normalise the size and composition of their balance sheets
(Box IV.C and Table IV.1).16 Central banks have generally communicated that they do
not regard interest rate and balance sheet adjustments as equivalent. Interest rates
are naturally seen as more agile, easier to calibrate and more predictable in terms of
market and economic impact. So far, the emerging consensus seems to favour
starting to normalise rates before trimming the balance sheet. Moreover, changes to
the balance sheet could, in principle, be used as a complementary tool, altering the
shape of the yield curve by influencing long-term yields through active sales:
empirical evidence indicates that large-scale asset purchases had a considerable
impact on long-term rates in the GFC’s aftermath.17 Indeed, central banks have not
ruled out this possibility. But so far the central bank that has communicated most
about the normalisation path, the Federal Reserve, has opted for a more passive, very
gradual and predictable approach, reducing the balance sheet primarily by ceasing
reinvestments at the rate regarded as appropriate. The 2013 taper tantrum, and the
associated communication difficulties, are still very much on policymakers’ minds.
Normalising the balance sheet raises other challenges too. Some are technical
and not new. For instance, because the central bank has no monopoly over the
outstanding supply of government securities available to investors at various
maturities, it cannot influence bond yields entirely on its own: what the government
does also matters. Thus, the impact of a reduction in balance sheets will depend on
how governments replace the maturing securities.
Other, novel challenges have more of a political economy nature. Large central
bank government bond purchases when rates are unusually low will entail losses
precisely when the policy succeeds; that is, when the economy and inflation recover

BIS 87th Annual Report

71

so that rates and yields rise again. The corresponding losses can lead to unwarranted
public criticism and even threaten the central bank’s autonomy. Similarly, large-scale
central bank government bond purchases, financed mainly with excess reserves,
amount to a sizeable quasi-debt management operation: they equate effectively to
replacing long-term debt with very short-term claims, indexed to the overnight rate
(Box IV.D and Table IV.1). This makes the government’s fiscal position more sensitive
to monetary policy tightening, possibly adding another source of pressure on the
central bank if the amounts involved are very large. One way of limiting or avoiding
both of these effects is to impose a non-remunerated reserve requirement to absorb
excess reserves or to pay differential rates on those reserves. This would amount to
a tax on the banking system, raising an additional set of issues.
The normalisation of monetary policy in the major economies also has
implications well beyond their borders. Developments in the past decade have
shown that monetary policy spillovers can pose complicated challenges for central
banks and disrupt adjustments in the global economy.18
EMEs are likely to be the most exposed (Chapter III). Given the large increase in
US dollar credit post-crisis, rising global interest rates and an appreciating US dollar
raise foreign currency debt burdens and widen spreads. This tightening of financial
conditions, together with volatility in financial markets, could have significant
macroeconomic implications.19 On the one hand, tighter financial conditions would

Unwinding central bank balance sheets

Box IV.C

Central banks face several challenges in unwinding their balance sheets. This box complements the main text by
considering two issues that can help shape the choice of unwinding strategies, ie the end-point, in particular the
balance sheet’s target size and composition, and views about the impact of balance sheet adjustments on financial
conditions.

The end-point: balance sheet size and composition
Pre-GFC, the size of central banks’ balance sheets was determined mainly by two factors: on the asset side, any
desired foreign exchange reserve holdings; on the liability side, the amount of cash demanded by the public, and
bank reserve balances, which were treated as autonomous factors to be passively accommodated. Absent large
foreign exchange reserve holdings, this meant a rather small balance sheet, given that demand for cash was limited
and control over the policy rate did not require large holdings of bank reserve balances. Indeed, where the central
bank did not rely on reserve requirements, as in Canada, holdings were negligible.
The economics of central bank balance sheet size have not fundamentally changed post-crisis. True, there may
be reasons for central banks to operate with larger balance sheets than before. The authorities may wish to broaden
access beyond banks or continue to set interest rates through a floor system (via the rate on deposit facilities for
excess reserve balances) rather than through a corridor system. They may also want to augment the supply of liquid
assets for banks. But none of these considerations requires a significantly larger balance sheet. For example, a floor
system can be operated with a small amount of excess reserves, and short-term government paper can substitute
closely for bank reserves as a safe liquid asset. Because larger balance sheets raise challenges (eg of a political
economy nature) and constrain future room for manoeuvre, it is not surprising that central banks are considering
how to trim them to a more “normal” size, with due regard for country-specific features and as circumstances allow.
On the asset side, the desired balance sheet composition largely reflects structural factors and philosophical
perspectives. Foreign exchange reserves are more important for non-reserve currency countries, especially small
open advanced economies and EMEs. Another key issue is the distinction between private and public sector claims.
In some countries, such as the United States or the United Kingdom, there has been a long-standing tradition of
holding claims on the public sector only; in others, such as some European economies, it has been more common to
hold private sector claims. This reflects a difference in the respective central banks’ predominant concerns, about
influencing the allocation of credit within the private sector on the one hand, and with being perceived to finance
the government on the other. Within the euro area, an important additional concern is that of inadvertently
generating transfers between member countries, which should be quintessentially a fiscal decision.

The transition: transmission channels and unwinding strategies
Empirical evidence confirms the widely held view that large-scale asset purchases have significantly influenced
yields and financial conditions. At the same time, it remains less clear through which channels they have worked,
and this question can affect choices about unwinding strategies.
A first distinction is between the impact of asset purchases as such, on the one hand, and of the information
they convey about the future policy interest rate path (the “signalling channel”), on the other. The former operates
mainly through term premia, the latter through the expected path of short-term rates (see also Box II.A).
The existence of a significant signalling channel complicates communication and tends to favour more passive
unwinding strategies, communicated in advance and in principle unresponsive to economic conditions. By adopting
such a strategy, the central bank would effectively put the unwinding on “autopilot”, preannouncing a given sizereduction path. The pace could involve, for instance, a predetermined schedule for phasing out reinvestments and
for allowing securities to run off as they mature. This would limit any signalling effect to the time of the announcement,
so that the central bank could thereafter signal its stance exclusively through changes in the policy rate. But clearer
communication comes at the expense of less flexibility in responding to changing economic conditions – a price the
central bank may be prepared to pay, especially if the effects of a more active strategy are perceived as unpredictable
(see main text). At the cost of diluting the autopilot element, the strategy could be complemented with escape
clauses in order to avoid excessive rigidity and strengthen credibility. The Federal Reserve, for instance, appears to
have chosen to proceed this way.
A second distinction is between stock and flow effects. The prevailing view among economists is that stocks
matter most for asset prices: at any given time, investors must be content with the portfolios they have, otherwise

BIS 87th Annual Report

73

prices will adjust. In particular, the duration of the central bank’s holdings is especially important for term premia.
Similarly, the relative scarcity of specific securities may incentivise investors to purchase assets with greater duration
and credit risk. At the same time, it is also possible that flows matter – a view that has some currency among
market participants. In this case, the balance between actual purchases and sales in any given period becomes
critical.
Concerns with flow effects would induce central banks to pay more attention to smoothing out actual
transactions and would strengthen the case for gradualism. Order imbalances could become more important as,
on average, 24% of total central bank holdings of government securities are set to mature in the next two years
(Table IV.1). This puts a premium on avoiding cliff effects linked to lumpiness in the portfolio’s maturity profile.
Similarly, the relationship with the Treasury’s issuing schedule would also matter more. And since stocks are much
less volatile than flows, if the central bank wished to avoid large adjustments in yields it would tend to prefer a more
gradual unwinding pace (eg phasing out reinvestments as opposed to stopping them abruptly).
A third distinction is between the impact of announcements and actual transactions. Even in a pure stock view,
is it the actual stock at any given point in time or the market expectations thereof that matters? Arguably, both play
a role. That said, both casual and formal evidence indicate that announcements are quite important. For example,
when central banks were easing policy, it was not uncommon for them to surprise markets, doing more than
expected, thereby having a bigger impact on yields. To the extent that a central bank opts for more passive
strategies during the unwinding phase, it may be important to update markets regularly about the evolution in its
thinking about a chosen strategy and the implications of incoming data; this would ensure that markets are well
prepared by the time of implementation and mitigate the risks of sharp price adjustments.
The composition of the assets held in the portfolio adds another set of considerations. One dimension concerns
the maturity structure. The longer the maturity, the longer the period needed for the unwinding. The average
residual maturity of central banks’ holdings of government securities varies widely, ranging from five years in
Sweden to 12 years in the United Kingdom (Table IV.1). Another dimension is the distinction between private and
public sector claims. In the case of the Federal Reserve, for instance, it currently holds around $1.5 trillion of
mortgage-backed securities that will mature between 2040 and 2048. Historically, claims on the private sector have
only made up a small fraction of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. In the case of the Eurosystem, market liquidity
issues in some national sovereign and corporate markets could be especially important, given the large share of
central bank holdings.

depress economic activity. On the other hand, the depreciation of the domestic
currency would put upward pressure on inflation, threatening second-round effects,
especially in those economies with a poorer inflation record and more fragile fiscal
positions. Central banks can seek to mitigate this dilemma by drawing on their
foreign exchange reserves as well as by implementing macroprudential measures
and possibly capital flow management tools. But there are clear limits to how far
such a strategy can be pushed: it can help to smooth the adjustment but cannot
solve the underlying problem.
Small open advanced economies will not be immune either (Chapter III). While
any depreciation pressure on the domestic currency might be welcome where
inflation is stubbornly below target, any spillovers through higher bond yields may
not be – depending on the cyclical position and underlying financial conditions,
not least the phase of the domestic financial cycle. Central banks may try to use
forward guidance to insulate their yields from those in the core jurisdictions, but
here, too, there are limits to how far such a strategy can be effective.20

Box IV.D

Fiscal impact of changing interest rates when central bank balance sheets are large
While much attention has focused on the impact on bond yields of changes in central banks’ large-scale government
bond purchases, the effect on a government’s financing costs has gone largely unremarked. And yet, if those
changes are large enough, the impact can be sizeable. And this could have significant macroeconomic implications
especially in economies with a high government debt-to-GDP ratio.
The main reason is simple. From a consolidated public sector balance sheet perspective (ie one that nets out
assets and liabilities between the central bank and government), large-scale purchases amount to a withdrawal of
duration from the market: it is as if the government replaces long-term debt – the amount purchased by the central
bank – with very short-term debt – the liabilities the central bank issues to finance the purchases. Since these
liabilities typically take the form of excess reserves held by banks, they are equivalent to overnight-indexed debt.
This makes the government’s net borrowing costs more sensitive to higher rates.
How large can this effect be? A back-of-the-envelope calculation can help put this in context. Assume, for
simplicity, that at the time of a policy rate increase all government bonds held by the central bank have a residual
maturity of at least two years (ie none of the securities mature within that period) and that the central bank does not
purchase any new securities. Assume further that those bonds were issued at a fixed interest rate. This means that
an increase in the cost of remunerating excess reserves (which moves with the policy rate) will not be matched by any
increase in interest on central bank bond holdings. If the excess reserves in this calculation are, say, 10% of total
government debt outstanding, each 1% increase in rates would raise interest payments by 0.1% of the debt stock.
The impact can be particularly significant when excess reserves and government debt are large. For instance, if
central bank excess reserves are 50% of outstanding government debt, a 200 basis point rate rise would amount to
1% of government debt. If interest payments on government debt are, on average, 2%, this would be equivalent to
a 50% increase in debt financing costs. And if the debt-to-GDP ratio were 100%, this would translate one-to-one
into percentage points of GDP.
How indicative is this example? A number of factors need to be considered. First, central banks purchase
government debt all the time in order to finance normal balance sheet growth arising from increases in reserve
requirements and cash demand from the public. The back-of-the-envelope calculations above apply only to the
change in central bank purchases specifically implemented to influence financial conditions. Second, the higher
funding cost is transitory. Assuming a given balance sheet size, the central bank will need to reinvest the proceeds
of any maturing bonds, and will do so at higher interest rates (across all maturities). Thus, over time, as the initial
stock of bonds rolls over, the higher interest earned on the new bonds will offset the higher funding cost. In addition,
the bond purchases would shorten the average maturity of the outstanding debt held by the public and hence
would reduce the overall interest cost to the government over the long run as long as the yield curve is upwardssloping. Third, the rules for central bank profit transfers and accounting conventions can make it difficult to track
the size of the impact. Finally, the central bank could decide to offset some of the additional costs by lowering the
average remuneration on required reserves, by either expanding unremunerated required reserves or applying
differential rates on excess balances (eg a zero rate on a portion of excess balances).
Table IV.1 provides a sense of the relative sensitivity of government financing costs to rate increases for a range
of central banks that have engaged in large-scale asset purchase programmes. Based on general government debt
as a percentage of GDP alone, the impact is likely to be largest in Japan and smallest in Sweden. Based on excess
reserves as a percentage of government debt, the impact would be smallest in the United States and largest in
Japan. The United Kingdom, the euro area and Sweden fall somewhere in between. Based on today’s average
maturity of government securities on central bank balance sheets, the transitional effect would be larger and longerlasting in the United Kingdom and smaller and shorter in Sweden, and somewhere between in the other countries.

Policy, vol 29, December 2013.      Central banks can also influence financing conditions by swapping bonds of different maturities in
their portfolio without issuing central bank securities or reserves, as the Federal Reserve did during Operation Twist in late 2011 and
2012.      Alternatively, assume that the central bank does not reinvest the proceeds from the maturing bonds or attempt to prevent the
automatic shortening of its bond portfolio’s average maturity.

These challenges strengthen the case for enhanced central bank cooperation
during normalisation. Depending on the severity of the spillovers and spillbacks,
enhanced cooperation can take different forms. At a minimum, it could involve
close dialogue so as to reach a better understanding of the perceived trade-offs,
the reasoning behind decisions and the consequences of those decisions across the
world. This would support enlightened self-interest, through which central banks
would better take into account spillovers and spillbacks. In some cases, such selfinterest could also extend to joint action, as during the GFC.21

V. The financial sector – preparing for the future

The financial sector faces an improving but still challenging environment. The nearterm economic outlook has brightened substantially, and financial headwinds have
turned into tailwinds in many advanced economies. Even so, uncertainty about the
sustainability of the expansion lingers alongside structural challenges, such as
technological innovation and consolidation pressures. And interest rates and term
premia remain low across the major economies, compressing intermediation
margins.
Against this backdrop, and with the main regulatory reforms about to be
completed, it is important that banks and other financial institutions take advantage
of improved conditions to further increase resilience and reshape their business
models. The ultimate goal is a stronger financial system that supports the resilience
of the global economy. This requires the continued resolve of both the private and
public sectors.
This chapter first reviews recent banking, insurance and asset management
sector developments. It then discusses how banks are adjusting their business
models in response to key financial sector trends. It finally elaborates on changing
US dollar funding patterns and their implications for bank business models and
systemic risk.

Financial institutions: dissipating headwinds
Banks
In recent years, bank profitability has been hamstrung by tepid economic growth,
low interest rates and relatively muted client activity. Yet, with the global recovery
maturing and monetary policy in key jurisdictions poised for a gradual tightening,
the outlook for banks’ bottom line is now improving. This underlines the need for
banks to use the “growth dividend” of dissipating headwinds to complete the
adjustment of their business models to the post-crisis reality.
Conjunctural factors continued to be a drag on profitability, even though the
impact varied across regions. Net income, for example, remained well below preGreat Financial Crisis (GFC) levels. Relative to total assets, it hovered around zero
across much of Europe and was only slightly higher in many other jurisdictions,
including key emerging market economies (EMEs). Past years of low and declining
interest rates had eroded yields on earning assets. Even though interest expenses
also declined, assets typically repriced more quickly, weighing on net interest
income. Revenue from fees and commissions and other capital market activities also
remained subdued. That said, corporate bond issuance and merger and acquisition
(M&A) activity supported bank revenues in jurisdictions such as the United States
(Table V.1).
There are now signs that conjunctural headwinds are receding. To the extent
that economic activity continues to strengthen, higher interest rates and rising term
spreads should support intermediation margins. Stronger demand for banking
services and higher capitalisation levels, in turn, should underpin business volume
and balance sheet expansion. And both revenue growth and capital buffers would
help cushion any interest rate-driven valuation losses on securities portfolios. Post-

crisis declines in interest rates have increased the duration of outstanding securities,
making unhedged fixed income positions vulnerable to mark-to-market losses
(“snapback risk”, Chapter II). Such pressures could be particularly pronounced in a
context of tightening US dollar funding conditions (see below).
Individual banks’ ability to benefit from the improved macroeconomic
backdrop and rising interest rates depends on a number of factors. One is asset
composition: revenue growth is driven by the rollover of maturing fixed rate assets
and loans and, hence, depends on the share of fixed rate versus floating rate assets.
On the liabilities side, core deposits are known to be relatively price-insensitive.
Since they are a key funding source for many banks, increases in funding costs
generally lag those in short-term rates. In addition, moderately stronger economic
growth and higher rates tend to boost client activity across several business lines.
Indeed, starting in mid-2016 capital market revenues benefited from higher market
volatility after the Brexit referendum and in anticipation of US policy rate action
(Chapter II).

Another factor is asset quality. This should generally improve as GDP growth
picks up, unemployment declines and rising demand supports the corporate sector.
In most advanced economies, expectations are that this will help non-performing
loans (NPLs) to level off and ultimately decline. That said, banking systems in some
jurisdictions still look vulnerable to a further deterioration in credit quality. In a
number of euro area countries, for example, the share of NPLs remains stubbornly
high. Structural factors, such as ineffective legal frameworks and defective
secondary markets for NPLs, have been hindering the resolution of problem loans.1
The outlook for asset quality becomes more differentiated once countries’
position in the financial cycle is considered (Chapter III). Standard metrics, such as
credit-to-GDP gaps, signal financial stability risks in a number of EMEs, including
China and other parts of emerging Asia. Gaps are also elevated in some advanced
economies, such as Canada, where problems at a large mortgage lender and the
credit rating downgrade of six of the country’s major banks highlighted risks related
to rising consumer debt and high property valuations.2 While banks’ NPL ratios in all
these countries mostly remained low, a majority of EMEs have continued to see
financial booms, flattering credit quality indicators. Thus, loan performance should
be expected to deteriorate once the financial cycle turns. In addition, pressures
could also emerge as a result of spillovers from tighter US monetary policy. In some
Asian economies, for example, non-financial corporates took advantage of easy
global financing conditions to leverage up in US dollars.3 Many of these corporates
may thus find themselves unhedged and exposed to currency mismatches if their
domestic currencies depreciate. Any balance sheet strains, therefore, could ultimately
feed into banks’ credit risk exposures.

Other financials
Just like their banking sector peers, many insurance companies continued to struggle
with the confluence of an often sluggish recovery and low interest rates. Insurers’
performance depends on investment returns and the business mix, primarily
property and casualty (P&C) and life insurance, as well as the importance of legacy
guaranteed-return contracts. Declining interest rates inflate the value of both assets
and liabilities, but long maturities and negative duration gaps mean that the net
effect is negative (Graph V.1, left-hand panel). Together with low investment returns,
this can cause considerable strains, particularly for life insurers with high guaranteed
rates in the legacy book, such as in Germany and the Netherlands.
In recent years, insurers – and pension funds – have tackled these pressures in
a variety of ways. On the liabilities side, they have shifted underwriting practices
towards contracts with reduced or no guarantees as well as unit-linked products,
which place the investment risk with the policyholder. Such adjustments, however,
can take a rather long time to be effective. For instance, according to the
International Association of Insurance Supervisors, some 80% of life insurance
premiums in Germany are for previously written guaranteed rate plans.
On the assets side, there has been a trend to reach for yield. Asset allocation
has shifted towards riskier assets, often via collective investment vehicles and in
foreign currency (Graph V.1, centre panel). For example, the proportion of
investment fund shares in the sector’s total assets rose from 16% in 2009 to 23% in
2016, on average, in the United States and the euro area. Even then, given
prudential considerations, changes in asset portfolio composition were generally
too modest to prevent investment yields from falling further (Graph V.1, right-hand
panel). On balance, however, in 2016 many insurers enjoyed profits, thanks to
higher gross premiums and improved conditions (such as low natural catastrophe
losses) in the non-life market (Table V.2).

While profitability pressures are likely to continue, the outlook is improving across
the major insurance markets. This should support premium growth. In life insurance,
premium volumes tend to be highly correlated with employment and GDP, as a
stronger economy pushes up sales. Rising interest rates, in turn, would boost asset
values relative to liabilities, generating valuation gains, and help alleviate some of

the margin pressure on guaranteed-return products. That said, investment returns
will adjust only gradually, as portfolios continue to be heavily tilted towards fixed
income instruments and many insurers have been forced to replace maturing bonds
with lower-yielding securities. In addition, in life insurance additional investment
income accrues mostly to policyholders. This is in contrast to the P&C business,
where the investment risk and associated returns are fully borne by the insurer.
Yet there could be risks to profitability, especially if markets disappoint. One
such risk stems from the sector’s increased equity holdings, which expose insurers to
stock market corrections and tail risks (Chapter II). Another risk may come from high
direct and indirect investment fund exposures. Over the last few years, asset
managers and other return-sensitive investors have increased their footprint in
markets for less liquid or riskier assets, such as corporate bonds (Graph V.2, left-hand
and centre panels). Given these investors’ growing allocations to such asset classes,
their portfolio decisions may test market liquidity under stress, which hinges on
market-makers’ willingness to accommodate temporary supply-demand imbalances.4
Sure enough, net flows into and out of investment funds have been very volatile,
such as during the “taper tantrum” bond market sell-off of 2013 (Graph V.2, righthand panel). The resulting redemption pressures can generate “fire sale externalities”
that would affect insurers’ investment income both directly, through their investment
fund holdings, and indirectly, through any impact on market prices.

Bank business models: the quest for sustainable profits
Banks have been facing persistent pressures to reshape their business models postGFC. Notable progress has been made in diversifying both income streams and

funding mix, while reducing balance sheet leverage. Yet market valuations for many
banks still point to investor scepticism. The sector thus still needs to adapt to
generate sustainable profits.

Signs of progress, but scepticism remains
Post-crisis, global banks’ business models have been challenged. In addition to a
difficult conjuncture (see above), banks have been under market and regulatory
pressure to raise capitalisation levels, often decisively, and cut leverage (Graph V.3,
left-hand panel). Overall, the transition to higher capital ratios, both in risk-adjusted
and non-risk adjusted terms, is nearing completion and has primarily been achieved
through retained earnings. Most banks monitored by the Basel Committee on
Banking Supervision already meet the fully phased-in Basel III standards. The larger
internationally active banks report, on average, a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1)
capital ratio of nearly 12% and a leverage ratio of 5.6%.
Two other major trends have marked banks’ adjustment to the post-crisis
environment. One concerns their funding mix: banks have generally reduced their
reliance on (unsecured) short-term wholesale funding and increased that on retail
funding, such as customer deposits. This has formed part of a broader shift towards
more retail-oriented business models, with relatively stable funding and income
sources (Graph V.3, centre and right-hand panels). Activity has also shifted towards
collateralised funding and central clearing, reflecting a keener awareness of
counterparty credit risks as well as regulatory incentives. That said, exposure to
rollover risks remains significant in some cases, notably in the global US dollar
funding market (see next section).

The other trend concerns banks’ activity mix. Post-crisis, many banks downsized
or exited business lines that had suffered large losses in the past or that had
exposed them to litigation risks. For many major banks, headline revenues from
activities such as proprietary trading have diminished and been partly replaced by
other sources of non-interest income, such as wealth management. Yet, while a
more diversified income base supports more sustainable profits, scale economies
and competitive pressures point to diversification limits for smaller banks and the
banking sector as a whole.
Despite the progress made and signs of an improved earnings outlook (see
above), market valuations continue to suggest investor scepticism about bank
business models, at least in some jurisdictions. For example, while broadly recovering
most recently, price-to-book ratios have remained below unity for many advanced
economy banks (Graph V.4, left-hand panel). Part of this scepticism reflects the
macroeconomic outlook and unresolved NPL problems in some countries (see
above). Another part points to unfinished business model adjustments and limited
earnings capacity more generally.
This is in line with how returns-on-equity (RoEs) have developed relative to
investors’ required returns. To be sure, the gap between observed and required
returns has narrowed. Even so, it remains positive in some regions, suggesting that
current RoEs continue to fall short of investor expectations (Graph V.4, centre
panel). This is so even though market-based estimates of the cost of bank equity
have receded from their crisis highs and broadly returned to their pre-crisis levels.
Notably, in Europe the gap widened most recently, highlighting persistent pressures
to further improve profitability.

Despite improvements, many banks are still struggling to adjust1

Moving ahead?
What steps are needed to alleviate market scepticism and complete business model
adjustments? Naturally, there is no “one size fits all” solution. However, several areas
are likely to remain important from both an individual bank and a banking sector
perspective: (i) capital allocation; (ii) cost efficiency; and (iii) excess capacity.
Banks’ capital allocation decisions determine the balance sheet capacity
available across business lines. The design of the Basel III framework, with its
reliance on multiple regulatory metrics, and the greater use of supervisory stress
testing in some jurisdictions mean that banks may have to adjust their capital
allocation practices. Given the interaction between regulatory constraints, optimal
capital allocation now involves considering multiple risk-return trade-offs. For
example, there is anecdotal evidence that banks implement the leverage ratio at
the business unit level, as opposed to the firm-wide level foreseen under Basel III.
This simplifies capital allocation, but also implies that the leverage ratio may
discourage certain low-risk/high-volume activities, such as market-making or repo
market intermediation, even when the leverage ratio is not binding at the
consolidated level (Box V.A). This would tend to open up business opportunities for
competitors, in turn promoting further adjustments to banks’ practices until the
industry converges to a new benchmark. Policymakers can aid this convergence by
swiftly finalising the remaining elements of regulatory reform and by ensuring
consistent implementation. This includes setting a high bar for any proposed
adjustments to the new regulatory standards, which should be based solely on
assessments of regulatory benefits and costs at the social – not the private or
sectoral – level.
The second area is improving cost efficiency, particularly in the light of increasing
digitalisation and competition from non-bank entities. Despite some recent progress,
cost-to-income ratios have remained stubbornly high for many banks, as cost savings
have tended to go hand in hand with declining revenues. Although branch networks
have generally been pruned, personnel costs, typically the largest component of
banks’ operating expenses, have changed little as a share of operating income – at
least not after an initial, crisis-induced contraction. Much of the recent improvement
in net income, particularly among European banks, was due to lower provisions,
because of stronger credit quality, rather than lower operating costs (Graph V.4,
right-hand panel). Pressures to further rein in costs thus remain strong, especially for
banks in jurisdictions known to suffer from excess capacity.5
Technological innovations, often referred to as “fintech”, are likely to play an
important role in this context. These innovations provide new ways to communicate,
store and process information, and to access financial services. As such, they are
changing how banks interact with each other and with their customers. In addition,
many of these new technologies were created by non-financial firms and, in some
cases, allow customers to access financial services without bank involvement,
adding to competition and margin pressure.6 Admittedly, the volume of fintechrelated activities remains small, and many new applications may fail. Even so, some
technologies have the potential to profoundly change bank business models.
Retail and commercial lending is one of the areas where competition between
banks and fintech companies has been most direct. Electronic platforms such as
online or peer-to-peer lenders, for example, facilitate credit provision by matching
borrowers with investors (Box V.B). Total credit volumes have so far remained small
relative to traditional bank lending. Yet recent trends indicate a range of activities
that allow banks to exploit scale economies and link their own comparative
advantages (eg a large client base and associated data) with those of partnering
fintech firms (eg a low cost base).

Box V.A

Bank capital allocation with multiple regulatory metrics

Research suggests that complementary regulatory metrics, like those now introduced by the Basel III framework,
can improve market outcomes and economic welfare. For example, non-risk-based metrics, such as the leverage
ratio (LR), can act as backstops for banks’ risk-weighted capital requirements. Multiple metrics require banks to
adjust their internal capital (and liquidity) allocation management – a process that is still under way.
A simple model, which focuses on the role of the LR, helps to illustrate the impact of the interaction between
such allocation decisions and regulation. The model, calibrated on US bank data, can rationalise why the LR may
affect banks’ capital allocation across business units (eg a trading unit and a loan-issuing unit as in the model) even
if a bank reports an LR well above regulatory minima, as is generally the case (Graph V.A, left-hand panel).
First, banks need to strike a balance between expanding their balance sheets today and costly deleveraging in
the future should they be hit by an adverse shock or subjected to a stress test. Since opting for a higher LR reduces
the risk of having to deleverage, such uncertainties induce banks to hold a buffer over the minimum requirement
(Graph V.A, centre panel).
Second, the LR tends to be tighter for banks that apply the ratio at a business unit rather than at the
consolidated bank-wide level, as intended by regulation. In the former case, low-risk/high-volume activities with low
risk-weighted regulatory capital charges, such as market-making, should be constrained most. Adjusting capital
allocation to take a more bank-wide perspective would reduce the tightness of the LR. Simulations indicate that the
associated capital relief could have sizeable effects on banks’ balance sheets, eg by supporting banks’ capacity to
warehouse assets for market-making purposes (Graph V.A, right-hand panel). This points to scope for future
adjustments to capital allocation frameworks to ease any perceived LR-induced pressures.

If adjusting the balance sheet after a shock
in order to meet regulatory requirements is costly (eg due to fire sale externalities), the bank chooses a higher leverage ratio ex ante (black
line) as compared with the case where adjustments carry no additional costs. 3 A tightening of the LR has a weaker impact on banks that
apply the LR at the bank level (blue line) as compared with those applying it by business unit (red line), because the former tolerate higher
leverage for individual business units (eg for market-making) as long as the bank-wide LR requirement is met. 4 Projected change in the

Banks and online lending: from competition to cooperation?

Fintech solutions enable customers to access financial services without – or with reduced – bank involvement,
potentially disintermediating incumbents. Fintech investment has been growing strongly (Graph V.B, left-hand
panel), albeit from a low base. One rapidly expanding area is online/peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, especially in
jurisdictions such as China and the United States (centre panel). From a bank perspective, online lending presents
both challenges and opportunities. Lending platforms are a potentially disruptive source of competition in a key
business line, particularly if they are subject to more lenient regulation. Yet banks can also reap the cost reductions,
improved customer experience and enhanced efficiency that these platforms offer. Many banks have thus been
working actively to integrate online lending solutions into their business models.
One approach is for banks to directly invest in online platforms through mergers and acquisitions (M&As) or
venture capital. M&As have generally accounted for the largest share of global fintech investment. A substantial
part of these investments has come from banks and other financials, providing them with a stake in any returns and,
in some cases, access to the platforms’ technology. Banks also provide debt financing to fintech platforms, for example
by funding fintech loans as institutional investors or by purchasing fintech loans.
Another approach is via partnerships. Partnerships in online/P2P lending and other fintech activities are
expected to grow in both advanced and emerging market economies (Graph V.B, right-hand panel). This can take a
variety of forms. One is referrals, whereby a bank refers certain borrowers to whom it denied credit to the fintech
platform, while the fintech platform refers customers that require banking services to the bank. A second one is loan
origination, in which the bank originates loans that have been assessed and priced on the online platform,
sometimes selling these loans back to the platform. A third one involves the provision of services, such as payment
and settlement services or guarantees. In some cases, mostly in the United States, banks have also supplied
warehousing facilities and related services that allow online platforms to securitise fintech loans. Finally, some banks
partner with platforms to use fintech models/processes in their own lending.

BIS 87th Annual Report

With the fintech sector still evolving, a pressing question for regulators is how
to ensure prudent risk management.7 Technologies based on vast amounts of
personal data, for example, give rise to new challenges in ensuring customer
privacy and data security. Mounting concerns about cyber-security underscore the
potential risks of technology-enhanced financial services. Due diligence of possibly
multiple internal and external service providers may be needed to ensure IT
systems’ integrity. Furthermore, competition between banks and fintech platforms
may require approaches that maintain a cross-sectoral level playing field (“same
risk, same rules”) to reduce regulatory arbitrage, while preserving incentives for
technological innovation, such as via regulatory “sandboxes”.
The third area concerns challenges at the industry level, such as excess capacity,
which are likely to require a coordinated response by prudential authorities and
policymakers. In many cases, excess capacity reflects policies that aim at protecting
weak banks from failure by providing explicit or implicit public support. Clearly,
such policies can be crucial in addressing systemic risks during crises. They can also
be a catalyst for a concerted clean-up of bank balance sheets, for example by
helping to sell off impaired assets. Yet they should not keep non-viable banks from
exiting or become an obstacle to bank merger activity. Indeed, barriers to exit
remain high in many banking sectors, notwithstanding improved resolution
mechanisms and tightened conditionality on bank recapitalisations. Policymakers
may thus need to step up their efforts to help reduce excess capacity in banking
sectors that suffer from weak profitability. This includes complementary supportive
measures, ranging from increased supervisory attention, to targeted legal steps to
facilitate the workout of problem loans (including via dedicated asset management
companies), to more comprehensive reforms that address deficiencies in national
labour and capital markets (Chapter I).

US dollar funding: a key pressure point?
Since major banks are at the core of the global financial system, their business
model choices can have far-reaching implications. The GFC, for example, illustrated
how non-US banks’ heavy reliance on wholesale and, in particular, US dollar funding
can amplify systemic risk. In the run-up to the crisis, many banks had built up
maturity mismatches in their foreign currency business. When wholesale markets
dried up, maturing funds became difficult to roll over or replace, forcing banks to
scramble for US dollar funding or deleverage. These funding pressures, in turn,
quickly spilled over across counterparties and jurisdictions. Thus, structural
vulnerabilities in banks’ funding models increased the vulnerability of the financial
system as a whole.
Post-crisis reforms have sought to minimise such risks. They have targeted
bank resilience, in terms of both capital and funding, as well as that of other key
market participants, such as money market mutual funds (MMMFs). Yet banks’
continued heavy reliance on short-term US dollar funding remains a pressure point,
especially given the high degree of market concentration.

US dollar funding risks
Foreign currency funding risk was prominent at the height of the GFC. In the wake
of their rapid international expansion pre-crisis, banks, particularly in Europe, had
accumulated foreign claims at a pace that outstripped domestic credit growth.
Foreign currency funding needs grew in lockstep, especially in US dollars, and were
met in part from cross-currency sources – that is, by borrowing in one currency to

funding profiles may have appeared robust from an individual bank’s perspective,

accounted for by instruments such as FX swaps (grey bars in Graph V.6). As of
end-2016, this took total non-US banks’ US dollar funding to around $10.5 trillion
(Box V.C). The heavy demand for FX swap dollar borrowing is reflected in the
premium banks typically pay in the FX swap market relative to the wholesale cash
market (Chapter II).12
Second, there are signs of significant rollover risks, as sizeable parts of banks’
US dollar funding rely on short-term instruments such as repos and FX swaps.
Recent market reactions to MMMF reform in the United States provide an
admittedly imperfect test of non-US banks’ resilience to these risks (Box V.C).
They suggest that the global banking system has been able to adjust rather
smoothly to the loss of US dollar funding from a key supplier, US “prime” funds.
While the cost spread on this funding has increased somewhat, volumes have
largely been replaced. However, the reform was gradual and well anticipated,
leaving open questions about banks’ ability to retain funding under less benign
conditions.
A mitigating factor is that a substantial part of banks’ short-term funding is
known to be collateralised, often with high-quality assets. This should help them
obtain funding from alternative sources, including central banks, if current ones
were to dry up. Yet although collateral helps mitigate both credit and liquidity risks,
haircuts could well increase during a liquidity squeeze – at least for lower-quality
collateral. There are also signs that banks’ funding mix has been shifting towards
offshore US dollar deposits (Box V.C), which lack the direct backstop ultimately
provided by the Federal Reserve.

Box V.C

US money market fund reform and non-US banks’ global dollar funding

The reform of US money market mutual funds (MMMFs) took effect in October 2016. Along with other rule changes,
the reform requires “prime” MMMFs to maintain a floating net asset value, changing the funds’ economics from an
investor perspective. Since non-US banks rely heavily on unsecured funding from prime MMMFs, it was feared that
the reform would lead to a US dollar funding crunch for these banks. Eventually, the reform did result in a substantial
loss of dollar funding from MMMFs and some increase in its cost (Chapter II). However, non-US banks were able to
mute the effect by raising US dollar deposits and similar funds from other sources.
On net, MMMF reform subtracted some $310 billion of US dollar funding from non-US banks in the four
quarters to September 2016, by which time most of the adjustment had taken place. A loss of about $480 billion
from prime MMMFs was partially compensated by some $170 billion in repo funding from government-only funds
(ie those not subject to the new regulations), with the maturity of MMMF funding declining in the process
(Graph V.C, left-hand panel). The composition of US dollar funding also changed, as foreign banks’ US operations
responded by running down their holdings of excess reserves at the Federal Reserve and, to a lesser extent, drawing
on funding from headquarters.
Overall, global (on-balance sheet) US dollar funding for non-US banks stood at almost $9.5 trillion at end-2016
(Graph V.C, right-hand panel). Off-balance sheet funding, mainly via FX swaps, raised the total to around $10.5 trillion.
Despite the run-off of eurodollar deposits by US MMMFs, offshore deposits at non-US banks rose to about $4.1 trillion
by September 2016, reflecting the rising importance of offshore funding in the global banking system. The MMMF
reform episode thus appears to confirm global banks’ ability to maintain US dollar funding. Yet questions remain
about the resilience of funding under more stressed conditions.

Third, international dollar intermediation appears to be rather concentrated.
Interbank US dollar lending is known to be dominated by about a dozen or so
large banks, with banks from eight non-US economies accounting for more than
60% of international dollar assets and liabilities. Much of the associated US dollar
funding flows through repo markets, which are themselves fairly concentrated, due
to sizeable scale economies in clearing and settlement. US triparty repos, where
clearing and settlement depend on services from only two clearing banks, are
estimated to account for about half of US repo market volume, at $1.7 trillion. The
other half is settled bilaterally. Similarly, inter-dealer repos in US government
securities are cleared via a single central counterparty (CCP), which accounted for
total net cash borrowings of about $124 billion in May 2017.13
Finally, banks – and banking systems – are likely to perform differently in terms
of shock transmission and absorption.14 Varying degrees of reliance on offshore
centres (blue bars in Graph V.6), for example, reflect differences in the way funds
are sourced and redistributed across banks’ global operations. The right-hand panel
of Graph V.6 provides a fuller picture of banks’ organisational structures, highlighting
the degree of centralisation of their international activities. On the basis of
aggregate asset positions, banks from Germany, Japan and Switzerland are relatively
centralised. That is, a lot of their US dollar and other foreign currency assets are
booked via their home offices or third countries, as opposed to banks’ local
branches and subsidiaries (high ratios on the horizontal axis). Liability patterns,
however, differ in that much of Japanese banks’ US dollar financing is locally
sourced (high values on vertical axis), whereas German and Swiss banks rely more
on home office and third-country funds. By contrast, Spanish and Canadian banks’
balance sheets reflect much more locally managed and funded foreign activities.15

Policy implications
The patterns highlighted above suggest that global US dollar funding markets are
likely to be a key pressure point during any future market stress episode. Non-US
entities’ US dollar funding needs remain large, posing potentially sizeable rollover
risks. They are also concentrated on a rather limited number of major banks.
Interconnectedness is another important factor, as dollar funds are sourced from a
variety of bank and non-bank counterparties to support both outright US dollar
lending and various types of market-based dollar intermediation. In this context,
counterparties such as MMMFs, insurance companies and large corporates interact
with banks in a range of markets, including those for repos and FX swaps. In
addition, many of the same banks provide services to entities such as CCPs, which
– under stress – can be a source of large liquidity demands.
What does this imply for policy? A first key issue is banks’ organisational
structures and the spillover risks that can arise from the links between their head
offices and local affiliates. This underlines the importance of supervisory cooperation.
Cooperation is essential to share information on banks’ global US dollar funding
profiles and conduct targeted stress tests (eg of banks’ reliance on the FX swap
market). Key tools include supervisory colleges, memoranda of understanding
(MoUs) and less formal home-host supervisory bilateral cooperation. In addition, in
some host jurisdictions regulators now require that foreign banks’ local operations
be more self-sufficient. Such measures, which sometimes involve full legal
subsidiarisation, give rise to important trade-offs. For instance, while mitigating
systemic risk concerns, subsidiarisation, and corresponding supervisory constraints
on foreign branches, may hinder the movement of funds across affiliates within the
same holding company and raise operating costs. This could deter foreign bank
participation – a consideration that may be especially relevant for EME regulators.16

BIS 87th Annual Report

93

Spillover risks also support work on broader preventive measures in several
areas. One is regulatory requirements to limit banks’ maturity transformation and
rollover risks. Examples include Basel III’s Liquidity Coverage Ratio, which can be
implemented at the individual currency level. Another involves more general steps
to enhance the resilience of banks and other financial institutions, including other
requirements under the Basel III package and similar regulations for non-banks,
such as US MMMF reform. International minimum standards, such as Basel III, also
help to reduce any distortions from unlevel playing fields or regulatory fragmentation.
A third area concerns market infrastructure design, including triparty repos and
CCPs. US repo market reform, for example, has successfully reduced the use of
clearing bank-provided intraday credit in triparty repos – addressing a concern
highlighted by the GFC. CCP resilience, in turn, is supported by measures such as
the CPMI-IOSCO Principles for financial market infrastructures and work under way
to enhance CCP recovery planning and resolution.17
A second key policy issue concerns access to US dollar funding during market
disruptions. Given cross-currency funding mismatches and associated rollover risks,
national authorities may need to facilitate access to US dollar funds to meet the
foreign exchange needs of domestic banks and corporates.
One way of doing so is through their holdings of foreign exchange reserves. In
2008, some EMEs used their reserves for this purpose.18 Yet authorities may be
reluctant to dip into their reserves: financial markets could see it as a negative
signal about the country’s condition. There are also signs that reserve management
can generate undesirable procyclical effects. During the GFC, for example, many
reserve managers reduced their placements with riskier counterparties, especially
banks, and cut back on their securities lending programmes.19
Another way to mobilise foreign currency funding is through central bank swap
lines. For the US dollar, only the Federal Reserve is in a technical position to supply
dollars elastically.20 This is why, during the GFC, major central banks opted for a
network of ad hoc swap lines among themselves to supply and distribute US dollar
liquidity. The arrangement’s success underlines the need for central banks to retain
the ability to offer such swap lines, some of which have since been made
permanent.21 Owing to several considerations, not least moral hazard and risk
management, such arrangements are likely to remain narrow in scope and be
designed for use only as backstops.22

cross-border collateral arrangements (CBCAs). Such arrangements can be an effective shock

otherwise be the case, aiding central bank responses in times of stress. See CGFS (2014), op cit.

VI. Understanding globalisation

Globalisation has had a profoundly positive impact on people’s lives over the past
half-century. Nevertheless, despite its substantial benefits, it has been blamed for
many shortcomings in the modern economy and society. Indeed, globalisation has
faced more severe criticism than technological innovation and other secular trends
that have potentially had even more profound consequences. This chapter outlines
how increased economic globalisation – tighter trade and financial integration –
has contributed to a remarkable increase in living standards. Adjustment costs and
financial risks need to be carefully managed, but they do not justify a backlash
against globalisation.1
Trade and financial openness are deeply symbiotic. Trade integration not only
relies on, but generates, financial linkages. Banks with international operations
underpin trade financing and follow their customers into foreign markets. Trade
denominated in a foreign currency can require hedging, with counterparties
accumulating international positions. Firms may build capacity in a foreign country
with an attractive skill or resource base in order to export from there. Managing the
financial asset and liability positions built up through trade induces still deeper
financial linkages, including international trade in financial services.
Tighter global economic integration has been hugely beneficial. Globalisation
has been instrumental in raising living standards and has helped lift large parts of
the world population out of poverty. Trade openness has greatly enhanced
productive efficiency and vastly improved consumption opportunities. Financial
openness, in addition to supporting international trade, allows greater scope for
diversifying risks and earning higher returns. It also makes funding more readily
available and facilitates the transfer of knowledge and know-how across countries.
Globalisation has also posed well known challenges. Gains from trade have not
been evenly distributed at the national level. Domestic policies have not always
succeeded in addressing the concerns of those left behind. The requisite structural
adjustment has taken longer, and been less complete, than expected. Furthermore,
unless properly managed, financial globalisation can contribute to the risk of
financial instability, much like domestic financial liberalisation has. And, not least
through financial instability, it can increase inequality. But globalisation has also
often been made a scapegoat. For instance, there is ample evidence that
globalisation has not been responsible for the majority of the concurrent increase
in within-country income inequality.
Attempts to roll back globalisation would be the wrong response to these
challenges. Globalisation, like technological innovation, has been an integral part of
economic development. As such, it should be properly governed and managed.
Countries can implement domestic policies that boost resilience. These include
flexible labour and product markets and policies that enhance adaptability, such as
retraining programmes. Close cross-country linkages imply that policies and actions
of individual countries inevitably affect others. Hence, international cooperation
must supplement domestic policies. In particular, a global regulatory framework
should be the basis for a sound and resilient international financial system.
This chapter first outlines the deep interconnectedness of trade and financial
openness and sets out a stylised framework to analyse globalisation. It then maps
out the historical path of globalisation – from the “first wave” leading up to World
War I, through the “great reversal” of the interwar years, to the revival and surge in

BIS 87th Annual Report

globalisation post-World War II in the “second wave”. The chapter argues that
recent suggestions of “peak globalisation” are misleading. Next, it reviews how the
structure of trade and financial integration has evolved in the second wave. It then
discusses the impact of globalisation on welfare, noting its contribution to the
substantial growth in incomes and the dramatic decline in poverty as well as the
risks to financial stability linked with financial openness. The final section makes
some concluding observations, discussing policy measures that can further enhance
the benefits of globalisation and minimise the adjustment costs.

Trade and financial openness are intertwined
International trade and financial openness go hand in hand. Trade is facilitated by
financial links, such as international payments and credit, and in turn results in
financial links, such as the accumulation of international assets and liabilities. As a
result, it is not surprising that countries that are more open to trade also tend to
have higher financial openness (Graph VI.1, left-hand panel).
The relationship between real and financial openness, however, evolves with
the degree of integration and development. Conceptually, one can think of three
globalisation layers. The first, most basic layer is trade of commodities and finished
goods and the corresponding simple international financial links, such as crossborder payments. The second layer involves more complex trade and financial
connections. It includes trade in intermediate goods and services associated with
the efficiency-driven fragmentation of production across countries and the
corresponding financing arrangements. The third layer concerns the financial
transactions increasingly used to actively manage balance sheet positions. These

BIS 87th Annual Report

The second wave of economic globalisation has outstripped the first

positions include the stocks of assets and liabilities, and exposures more generally,
created by the first two layers, as well as the allocation and diversification of
savings, not necessarily related to trade. The third layer thus introduces some
decoupling between real and financial openness.
The links between trade and financial openness are most immediate in the first
globalisation layer. Trade in this layer is mostly driven by resource endowments and
is directly supported by a range of international financial services. Trade is settled
with international payments, which almost always involve foreign exchange
transactions. Indeed, trade payments are generally denominated in a global
currency rather than that of either the exporter or importer: around half of all
international trade is invoiced in US dollars and close to a quarter in euros (even
excluding the trade of the United States and euro area countries, respectively).2
Furthermore, as international transactions take time to complete given shipping
time and customs processing, they require extra financing. Banks’ trade finance
facilitates around one third of international trade, with large global banks providing
between one quarter and one third of this.3 Letters of credit, where a bank
guarantees payment upon delivery of goods, underpin around one sixth of trade.
In the second globalisation layer, international financial linkages support a
greater degree of specialisation in trade and production, notably in the trade of
intermediate goods. Production can occur through ownership of foreign facilities
established by foreign direct investment (FDI), outsourcing to foreign firms, or
fragmented production in a global value chain (GVC). This more complex trade
can go hand in hand with the growth of multinational corporations that serve
multiple markets, often through production-focused foreign affiliates while
concentrating research and development in the parent.4 These more intricate
production structures require more, and often more complex, financing. GVCrelated investments may call for cross-border financing, often in foreign currency.
And longer production chains may involve more working capital and larger foreign
currency exposures.5 Finance can promote trade by reducing these risks, for
instance through derivatives or borrowing in foreign currency to match
corresponding income streams.
The third globalisation layer is characterised by intricate financial links
established solely for financial purposes. This layer builds upon the first two to the
extent that trade has generated stocks of assets and liabilities that need to be
managed financially. More generally, the demand for, and supply of, more
sophisticated financial products and services increases with the wealth of businesses
and households. In a sense, trade also supports this third layer of globalisation
through its contribution to higher income growth. Indeed, financial openness tends
to increase strongly with income levels (Graph VI.1, centre panel). However, gross
foreign asset and liability positions grow much larger than net positions, underlining
the more independent nature of financial linkages: financial openness has
substantially outpaced real openness since the late 1980s, most notably for
advanced economies (Graph VI.1, right-hand panel).
The three layers share some common elements. One is the use of global
currencies. As the dominant global currency, the US dollar is used to denominate
not only around half of trade, but also roughly half of global cross-border bank
claims and more than 60% of central banks’ foreign exchange assets, and features
in 90% of foreign exchange transactions. Consequently, the dollar plays a central
role in determining global financial conditions (see also Chapter V). Another is
globally active financial institutions. They operate in many countries across multiple
continents. Through their international presence and sophistication, they facilitate
the global transfer of funding and financial risks. Balance sheets that are managed
at a consolidated level create close international financial linkages.

The first globalisation wave, which died out with World War I and the Great
Depression, saw a substantial increase in both real and financial cross-border
linkages. Trade openness for the then major economies, measured as the ratio of
imports plus exports to GDP, more than doubled from the early 1800s to be close
to 30% by the turn of the century (Graph VI.2).6 The increase in financial openness,

up until the early 1990s. Since then, the cross-border financial assets and liabilities
of advanced economies have surged, from roughly 135% to over 570% of GDP. In
contrast, the increase for EMEs during the same period was more modest, from
approximately 100% to 180% of GDP.

Trade
The nature of trade has changed markedly during the second globalisation wave.
Economic development, greater market access, and improvements in transportation
and in information and communication technology have broadened the range of items
traded. Natural resource endowments were an important determinant of trade flows
50 years ago, with much of trade in the first globalisation layer. Now, the location of
skilled and unskilled labour and relative expertise has become more important, with
the second globalisation layer becoming dominant. In the early 1960s, food accounted
for nearly one quarter of traded goods; today, its share is less than 10% (Graph VI.3,
left-hand panel). Similarly, trade in fuel and that in metals and ore are little changed as
a share of GDP, abstracting from the large price swings in those commodities. In
contrast, trade in services, including financial, has surged over the past three decades,
from 7% of global GDP to 13%. And by far the biggest change has been the growth in
the trade of manufactured goods: they now constitute over half of global trade.
GVCs have been a key driver of trade growth, especially in manufactured
goods, facilitated by the improvements in market access, transport and technology.9
The process started in the mid-1980s, with high- and low-skill tasks increasingly
being located in different countries. As a result, trade in intermediate goods and
services now accounts for almost two thirds of total global trade.
EME participation in GVCs has increased dramatically. In 2014, EMEs were
involved in half of GVC trade, as measured by trade in intermediate goods and

services, up from around one third in 2001 (Graph VI.3, centre panel). The share of
GVC trade between EMEs has more than doubled. China alone is now responsible
for 19% of GVC trade, up from 7%. And in the process, intra-EME trade integration
has increased at a faster rate than that of advanced economies, alongside EMEs’
greater heft in the world economy (Box VI.A; Graph VI.3, right-hand panel).
Large multinational corporates dominate global trade. These firms, with
operations in multiple countries, often play a prominent role in GVCs. For example,
in the United States around 90% of trade involves multinationals, and half is
between related entities within a multinational.10 Despite the expansion in EME
trade, multinationals remain more prevalent in advanced economies.

Finance
Advanced economies’ financial openness accelerated markedly from the mid-1990s.
International assets and liabilities soared as financial liberalisation and innovation
provided new opportunities to manage positions and risk. Advanced economies’
external liabilities surged from under 80% of GDP in 1995 to over 290% in 2015.
Every major component of external liabilities at least doubled as a share of GDP.
Highlighting the prominence of the third globalisation layer, portfolio debt liabilities
quadrupled and portfolio equity liabilities more than quintupled.
Tighter financial integration was most evident in advanced Europe, where the
introduction of the euro helped boost cross-border transactions (Graph VI.4, lefthand panel). Between 2001 and 2007, 23 percentage points of the increase in the
ratio of advanced economies’ external liabilities to GDP was due to intra-euro area
financial transactions and another 14 percentage points to non-euro area countries’
financial claims on the area.
Just as multinational corporations play a key role in trade, large internationally
active financial institutions increasingly dominate global finance, particularly in
advanced economies. These giants have subsidiaries and branches in countries
across several continents. They engage not only in cross-border financial transactions,
but also in local borrowing and lending, not classified as international transactions
in the balance of payments (BoP) accounting framework. As a result, standard BoPbased measures of financial openness tend to underestimate the degree of global
interconnectedness (Box VI.B), just as they do for the non-financial sector, where
multinationals’ subsidiaries produce for their local market.
For EMEs, overall financial openness has grown only slightly faster than trade
openness, but the composition of external liabilities has changed substantially to
support greater risk-sharing (Graph VI.4, right-hand panel). The share of equity
(portfolio equity and the equity component of FDI) has risen considerably since the
early 1980s.
A couple of factors have contributed to the growing share of equity liabilities
in EMEs. First, tighter EME trade integration has stimulated equity flows, such as
through GVCs. Second, improvements in institutional quality and governance and
in macroeconomic conditions have whetted investors’ appetite for long-run EME
exposures. These factors have been particularly important for FDI, given its
dependence on longer-run macroeconomic considerations.11
However, the increase in risk-sharing is not as great as the rising total FDI share
in global capital flows suggests. First, FDI flows consist not only of equity but also
of debt, which engenders less risk-sharing. The debt component captures (nonfinancial) intra-company flows, driven by non-financial corporates’ offshore issuance
and investment activity.12 As a result, FDI debt tends to behave more like portfolio
debt than like the more stable FDI equity. Second, a large part of the recent rise
reflects positions vis-à-vis financial centres. To this extent, it mirrors mainly the

greater complexity of multinational corporations’ corporate structure rather than
traditional greenfield investment.13
The composition of EMEs’ external assets is very different from that of their
liabilities. This reflects how EMEs have responded to the increase in third-layer
globalisation among advanced economies. The greater size and range of global
financial interactions have made EMEs more susceptible to financial shocks, as
witnessed by the financial crises in the 1980s and 1990s. These crises prompted
many EME governments to accumulate substantial foreign exchange reserves. Also,
the combination of EMEs’ rising incomes, high saving and limited availability of
domestic safe assets increased the private sector’s demand for advanced economy
assets.

Has globalisation peaked?
The rise in globalisation has been in check since the Great Financial Crisis (GFC) of
2007–09.14 International trade collapsed during the GFC and, despite a rapid
rebound, has remained relatively weak (Graph VI.3, right-hand panel).15 In real
terms, global trade has barely grown in line with global GDP. This is striking given
that trade has consistently outpaced GDP since the mid-1800s, with the exception
of the interwar years. In nominal terms, trade appears even weaker, failing to keep
up with GDP growth owing to the fall in the relative prices of traded goods and
services, particularly commodities. The GFC also brought to a halt the rapid rise in
standard BoP-based measures of financial openness. The global stock of external
assets and liabilities in 2015 was little changed from its 2007 peak of just over 400%
of global GDP, in sharp contrast to the nearly 190 percentage point rise between
2000 and 2007 (Graph VI.2).
The interaction of real and financial factors within the first two globalisation
layers in part explains the easing in both trade and financial openness. In the early

A globalisation map

Trade and financial connections are not evenly spread across countries. Geographically close and economically
similar countries tend to have higher bilateral trade openness (Table VI.A, top left-hand panel). As a result,
intraregional trade openness (diagonal elements in top left-hand panel) tends to be greater than interregional trade
openness (off-diagonal elements). Advanced Europe is by far the most internally open region. That said, over the
past 15 years, intraregional trade openness has changed little among advanced economies, but has grown
noticeably among EMEs (Table VI.A, bottom left-hand panel). This has coincided with increased trade between
advanced economies and EMEs, driven primarily by the growth and development of EMEs.
Highlighting the imprints of the first two layers of globalisation, in which real and financial openness are closely
linked, there are clear similarities between the patterns of bilateral financial and trade links. Similar to trade links,
the strongest bilateral cross-border financial links are among and within advanced economy regions (Table VI.A, top
right-hand panel). Furthermore, just as in the case of international trade, there are strong financial linkages between
advanced and emerging Europe, between North and Latin America, and between all advanced economy groups and
emerging Asia. These similarities between the real and financial linkage maps reflect the first two globalisation layers.

Nevertheless, in line with the third layer of globalisation, there are also important differences between the
patterns of real and financial linkages. For example, the bilateral financial links are more narrowly concentrated than
their trade equivalents. The strongest links, those within advanced Europe, are substantially deeper than those
between advanced economies and EMEs, or within EMEs.
The evolution of financial and trade linkages has differed considerably over the past couple of decades. While
there has been a marked increase in intra-EME trade, particularly among EMEs in the same regions, the same is not
true for financial flows, with the exception of Africa and the Middle East (Table VI.A, bottom panels). The much
larger increases for financial flows between advanced economies than EMEs suggest that, despite the global
financial crisis, the pace of financial innovation and development is still much higher in advanced economies (top
left-hand quadrant of bottom right-hand panel). This is a clear manifestation of the third layer of globalisation.

  This is a long-standing finding in the international trade literature; see eg J Bergstrand, “The gravity equation in international trade:
some microeconomic foundations and empirical evidence”, The Review of Economics and Statistics, vol 67, no 3, pp 474–81, 1985.      The
three layers of globalisation, as outlined in the main text, relate to an increasing degree of sophistication in the links between economies.
They are (i) trade of commodities and finished goods and associated simple international financial links such as cross-border payments;
(ii) more complex trade and financial connections, including the efficiency-driven fragmentation of production across countries and
corresponding financing arrangements; and (iii) financial transactions increasingly used to actively manage balance sheet positions,
including the stocks of assets and liabilities created by the first two layers.

stages of the GFC, tighter financial conditions amplified the sharp fall in trade.16
Exports of more financing-dependent consumer durable and capital goods
plummeted, and the desire to borrow and availability of funds diminished. Other
common factors have been more important since then. The demand-induced
weakness in trade-intensive physical investment has also depressed the
corresponding international financing flows. The weak economic recovery in Europe
– an especially trade-intensive and financially open region – has been another
element. More generally, the pullback in trade and financial openness reflects a
desire to reduce risk, most obviously by financial institutions, but also by nonfinancial companies, as seen in the decline in disruption-sensitive GVCs.
However, at least on the financial side, the apparent pause in globalisation needs
to be interpreted with caution. First, conventional measures somewhat overstate the
reduction in openness. Despite being stagnant at the global level, the ratio of
external liabilities to GDP has continued to grow for both advanced economies and
EMEs post-crisis (Graph VI.4). This seeming anomaly reflects that the level of financial
globalisation is much lower for EMEs than for advanced economies, and so EMEs’
growing share of global GDP depresses the global measure of financial globalisation.
The expansion of financial openness for advanced economies has slowed considerably
since the crisis; by contrast, that for EMEs has continued unabated.
Second, the pullback in finance has been limited to some types of flows. It has
been concentrated in cross-border bank loans, a component that had fuelled the
rapid pre-crisis expansion in the highly procyclical third globalisation layer.17 Thus,
at least part of the current contraction reflects a healthy unwinding of unsustainable
pre-crisis positions.18 Furthermore, the contraction in cross-border loans has been
partly offset by a pickup in portfolio debt flows. Bond markets and asset managers,
spurred by low and sometimes negative yields, have largely filled the gap left by
banks – what has been termed the “second phase of global liquidity”.19 FDI and
portfolio equity have also continued to grow.
Finally, the contraction in bank lending is not as severe when measured using
alternative metrics of financial openness. The above figures are based on the
residence of the economic units, which is how the BoP statistics are constructed. A
complementary measure is based on the location of those units’ headquarters, or
nationality basis, and consolidates the corresponding balance sheet. This better
captures the decision-making unit and is especially relevant for internationally

Financial deglobalisation in banking?

“Peak trade” denotes the hypothesis that global trade is no longer growing faster than global GDP, which may
preclude the strategy of trade-led economic growth. A parallel thesis, perhaps global “peak finance”, asserts that the
world has seen the peak of global finance and that financial deglobalisation has begun. In particular, observers have
interpreted international banking data as showing financial deglobalisation. This box argues against this inference.
BIS data on cross-border banking positions give the appearance that banking deglobalisation set in during the
Great Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2007–09 and has continued since. Graph VI.B.1 (left-hand panel) shows that the crossborder claims reported by banks in more than 40 jurisdictions declined from a peak of 60% of global GDP in 2007
to less than 40% since 2013. These data are compiled on a balance of payments (locational) basis. Such stocks of
external assets are frequently used to measure international financial integration.
A limitation of using external assets is that these double-count some positions, and ignore other relevant ones.
Giving priority to where the banking business is conducted can be useful in a discussion of macroeconomic
aggregates, such as employment and value added. But cross-border claims are perhaps not the best way to analyse
globalisation trends in banking. They double-count positions in which a bank’s headquarters funds its branch in a
financial centre like London (left-hand panel, blue area) before lending abroad. At the same time, banks’ local
positions, ie those booked by a foreign affiliate on host country residents, are not captured in the external positions
of either the banks’ home country or the affiliates’ host country. On a consolidated view, these are foreign positions
– the bank has a claim on a borrower outside the home country, also if it is booked and even funded locally.
The BIS consolidated banking statistics, organised by nationality (on the basis of the location of banks’
headquarters), provide a clearer perspective on banking deglobalisation. First, local positions have not contracted
nearly as much as cross-border ones (Graph VI.B.1, centre panel). True, subtracting inter-office claims just about
offsets adding local claims – as a result, the centre panel tells a similar story to the left-hand panel. But the
consolidated perspective also makes clear that the shrinkage of international banking is largely confined to European
banks (Graph VI.B.1, right-hand panel).

That the apparent deglobalisation is more regional than global can be seen by contrasting asset growth by
booking location with that by bank nationality (Graph VI.B.2, left-hand panel). Banks headquartered in Europe
accounted for more than all of the global decline – that is, these banks’ foreign claims declined by more than
$9 trillion, while those of US banks and banks from other advanced countries and EMEs grew. The strength of the
apparent deglobalisation in banking reflects the size of European banks before the GFC and their subsequent
contraction.
The shrinkage of European banks’ foreign claims is better interpreted as (cyclical) deleveraging after a banking
glut than as a structural deglobalisation trend. While there has been a common move among big banks to raise the
ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets since the GFC (Graph VI.B.2, right-hand panel, black dots), European banks
uniquely did so in part by reducing total assets (a positive violet bar). Big banks elsewhere raised enough equity
through retained earnings and equity issuance while expanding total assets. Put differently, European banks did not
raise enough capital to achieve the 5 percentage point improvement in their weighted capital ratio without also
shedding assets. Given European banks’ extensive overseas operations, their retrenchment was felt around the
globe. Indeed, apart from Spanish banks, home bias tended to spare claims at home from the asset shedding.
A retreat to the home market when a bank has suffered losses can reflect lower expected returns abroad or
increased risk aversion, especially given losses abroad. But it can also reflect policy choices in the context of
widespread government support for banks and unconventional monetary policy that targets domestic lending.
On this view, the home bias evident in the European bank deleveraging may partly reflect policies. In any case,
consolidated banking data identifies the regional origin of the apparent trend in global aggregates.

active banks, as it includes the operation of their offices abroad. As the BIS
international banking statics (IBS) indicate, this transnational component has been
much more stable post-crisis (Box VI.B). Furthermore, there is some evidence that
EME banks, many of which are not captured by the IBS, have substantially increased
their international presence through foreign offices. This trend is especially
pronounced at the regional level.20

Globalisation and welfare
Globalisation has greatly contributed to higher living standards worldwide and
boosted income growth. Over the past three decades, it has been an important factor
driving the large decline of the share of the world population living in significant
poverty, and of income inequality across countries (Graph VI.5, left-hand panel).21 For
example, poverty has fallen markedly in China, where the development of export
industries has been a key force behind the rapid growth of GDP and incomes.
Over the same period, the income gains have not been evenly spread. The
biggest gains have accrued to the middle classes of fast-growing EMEs and the
richest citizens of advanced economies. In contrast, the global upper middle class
has experienced little income growth.22 This has seen within-country income
inequality increase in advanced economies and even many EMEs. The share of
income accruing to the top 1% of income earners has increased substantially since
the mid-1980s (Graph VI.5, centre panel).23 This contrasts with the fall in the
interwar period, attributed to capital destruction and regulatory and fiscal policies,
and for several decades thereafter.24 Some degree of income inequality resulting
from returns to effort can enhance growth by creating incentives for innovation.
But high inequality appears to be harmful to growth and has undermined public
support for globalisation.25

Debt flows are more procyclical than equity flows

BIS 87th Annual Report

There is strong empirical evidence that globalisation is not the main cause of
increased within-country income inequality; technology is.26 Still, the critics of
globalisation have often confounded the challenges that it poses with the main
drivers of many economic and social ills.

Globalisation and growth
Both trade and financial openness can be expected to increase the rate of economic
growth. Trade between nations increases the marketplace’s size and the competition
between firms. This improves efficiency as production is concentrated in the most
productive firms, wherever they may be. The most productive ones expand,
achieving greater scale economies and further enhancing their efficiency, while the
least efficient firms contract, increasing aggregate productivity. Overall, trade has
been found to boost growth in many economies. Trade also directly benefits
consumers, as they can choose from a greater variety of higher-quality products.27
Financial openness should also boost growth, by enabling a more efficient
allocation of capital and facilitating the transfer of technology and know-how. The
ability to hold foreign financial assets increases opportunities for higher returns
and for risk diversification. The injection of foreign capital can provide funding for
previously capital-constrained firms, increasing real competition and efficiency. FDI
can yield even greater benefits through the transfer of knowledge and technology
and the spread of best practices.
Empirical work has not universally identified increases in income or growth
from increased financial openness. One reason could be that the relationship is
non-monotonic: the benefits may materialise only if certain thresholds are met
regarding the recipient country’s financial market development, institutional quality,
governance framework, macroeconomic policies and international trade
integration. It has also been suggested that the benefits from capital account
deregulation may be less direct and take time to detect.28 Last but not least, many
of the existing empirical studies treat trade openness and financial openness as
independent variables, thus implicitly assuming that trade integration could take
place without financial integration. Yet, as discussed above, trade and financial
openness tend to go hand in hand.

Globalisation and inequality
National income undoubtedly increases with trade. However, the gains are unevenly
distributed – a general feature of economic dynamism. Less efficient firms facing
new competition contract, and it may take time for new ones to enter the market,
for instance because of regulatory or financial constraints. The winners and losers
are unevenly distributed across skills, income levels and location. Trade between
advanced economies and EMEs generally increases the return to advanced economy
skilled labour, which is relatively scarce globally. In contrast, the returns to unskilled
labour in advanced economies may well diminish because of the greater
competition from the large pool of unskilled EME labour. Conversely, unskilled
labour in EMEs may benefit. At the same time, trade also leads to relative price falls
for goods disproportionately consumed by lower-income households, boosting
their relative purchasing power.29 Given these offsetting effects, the net effect on
inequality from trade openness is uncertain in economic models.
There are also opposing channels through which financial openness could
affect income inequality. If financial openness increases the ability of low-income
individuals to borrow, it can enhance their opportunities for income generation.
Indeed, there is evidence that greater access to (domestic) finance can increase

incomes of the poor.30 Alternatively, if financial openness, and FDI in particular,
increases capital intensity and the returns to skill, the benefits could accrue to
higher-income individuals. Financial openness could also increase income inequality
if domestic institutions are not strong enough to prevent special interest groups
from capturing the associated gains.31
Trade and financial openness can also increase inequality by favouring income
from capital sources. Greater international mobility of goods and capital, relative to
labour, can reduce labour’s “pricing” power, putting downward pressure on wages,
and constrain the feasibility of taxing capital, contributing to higher taxes on labour
income.32 Since lower-income households rely primarily on labour income, these
effects are likely to increase inequality.
In practice, trade and financial openness appear to have made only a fairly
small contribution to the increase in income inequality (Graph VI.5, right-hand
panel). For financial globalisation, this effect is likely to have been somewhat larger
in low-income countries.33 Rather, technology appears to have been the dominant
factor: the returns to skilled labour, which uses technology more intensely, have
increased substantially.34
While declining labour shares have been linked to globalisation, the evidence
indicates that it is not the only driver. Declines have not occurred in some highly
open countries, such as France and the United Kingdom, and industries, including
agriculture and financial and business services. Moreover, labour shares in many
economies decreased the most in previously regulated services and utilities, many
of which are not traded, where returns fell as a result of structural reforms. In a
number of other countries, the decline in labour shares was mainly due to surging
housing rents (including imputed rents of homeowners).35
Importantly, the impact of trade on inequality depends on obstacles to
adjustment. In some cases, there have been persistent localised economic
contractions in areas adversely affected. Falls in employment and wages in importcompeting firms have been compounded by these firms’ reduced purchases from
their suppliers, who are often located nearby. This spills over to spending more
broadly in the local community.36 These effects can be persistent if labour is
immobile across regions and industries.

Globalisation and financial stability
One specific mechanism through which globalisation can affect economic growth,
poverty and inequality is its impact on financial stability. Financial crises can result
in a permanent loss of income, have a devastating effect on poverty and increase
inequality.37
Just like poorly managed domestic financial liberalisation, unfettered financial
openness can contribute to financial instability unless sufficient safeguards are in
place. It is no coincidence that, after financial crises were relatively common in the
first globalisation wave, there were few in the following era of financial repression
which lasted into the 1970s. The EME financial crises of the 1980s and 1990s
involved sharp reversals of international capital flows. And the GFC saw large
spillovers between national financial systems. In addition, financial openness may
adversely affect financial stability if it constrains the effectiveness of independent
domestic monetary policy.38
Past episodes of financial instability have demonstrated the importance of
three international propagation mechanisms. First, highly mobile international
capital can behave in a very procyclical manner, amplifying financial upswings and
reversals. Second, foreign currency exposure, in particular in dollars, transmits
tighter global financial conditions and exposes countries to foreign exchange

losses. And third, close financial linkages between globally active financial
institutions can spread financial stress, although they may also act as a buffer when

appreciation, typically based on concerns about the loss of competitiveness (on the
real side) and the possibility of surges in capital flows (on the financial side). The
second channel is related to the fact that the domains of major international
currencies extend well beyond their respective national jurisdictions.44
This global currency channel is especially powerful in the case of the US dollar
– the dominant international currency. The outstanding stock of US dollardenominated credit to non-bank borrowers outside the United States, a key
indicator of global liquidity conditions, stood at $10.5 trillion as of end-2016. This
outsize external role means that changes in the US monetary policy stance have a
substantial influence on financial conditions elsewhere (Box VI.C). And since
monetary policymakers, including those in control of major international currencies,
are focused on domestic conditions, they could unintentionally end up contributing
to financial imbalances well beyond their national borders. Notably, against the
backdrop of the exceptionally accommodative US monetary policy stance, US dollar
credit to non-bank EME borrowers roughly doubled between 2008 and 2016,
reaching $3.6 trillion at the end of that period.
One of the key channels through which US monetary policy impacts financial
conditions elsewhere is the US dollar exchange rate. In the so-called “risk-taking
channel of currency fluctuations”, the depreciation of a global funding currency
flatters the balance sheets of currency-mismatched borrowers and boosts lenders’
risk-taking. This channel is especially relevant for external debt flows to EMEs
(Graph VI.6, right-hand panel). The channel may also influence, in particular,
manufactured trade through the GVCs, which are especially sensitive to financing
conditions.45
The intermediation of global currencies, especially the dollar, also creates close
linkages between globally active banks. The GFC demonstrated how such
interconnectedness propagated funding stress between the world’s largest banks
and forced them to deleverage internationally. Thus, the regulatory reforms in the
aftermath of the GFC have focused on strengthening the resilience of international
banks that are the backbone of global financial intermediation.

Getting the most from globalisation
The globalisation surge over the past half-century has brought many benefits to
the world economy. Openness to trade has enhanced competition and spread
technology, driving efficiency gains and aggregate productivity. The resulting
stronger income growth has supported a remarkable decline in global poverty and
cross-country income inequality. The ability to source cheaper, and better-quality,
goods and services from all over the world has also directly increased households’
living standards. And the benefits do not just relate to trade. Financial openness is
inextricably intertwined with trade openness: financial linkages both support trade,
and are created by trade. Financial openness, properly managed, can also
independently enhance living standards through a more efficient allocation of
capital and know-how transfers.
While globalisation increases living standards, it does create challenges. First,
the gains are not equally distributed. The distributional implications of trade and
financial openness need to be addressed to ensure fair outcomes within societies
and continued support for growth-enhancing policies and economic frameworks,
including global commerce. That said, other factors – most notably technology –
have played a dominant role in the increase in income inequality. Just as there is no
suggestion to wind back technology, reversing globalisation would be greatly
detrimental to living standards.

112

BIS 87th Annual Report

Second, financial openness exposes economies to potentially destabilising
external forces. This risk can be managed by designing appropriate safeguards, just
as in the case of risks associated with domestic financial liberalisation. Since
international trade and finance are inextricably intertwined, particularly in the first
two globalisation layers, reaping the benefits of trade would be impossible without
international finance. That is why the policy solution is not to reduce financial
openness, but rather to carefully address the associated risks.
The challenges of managing economic change are not unique to globalisation.
As with other secular trends, well designed policies can offset the adjustment costs
associated with globalisation and enhance the gains from it.
On the domestic front, countries can implement policies that boost resilience.
Just as in the case of technology, flexible labour and product markets and measures
that enhance adaptability, such as retraining programmes, can reduce any tradeinduced dislocations. Well targeted policies may also help counteract the sometimes
persistent losses experienced by segments of society, for example region-specific
employment initiatives.46
Strong policy and institutional frameworks designed to make financial systems
sounder are critical to reaping the full benefits of financial openness. The domestic
financial stability policy toolkit is important.47 This calls for well articulated
macroprudential frameworks on a firm microprudential base. And it also requires
the capacity to address directly any debt overhang and asset quality problems that
might arise during financial busts, in order to repair balance sheets and improve
overall creditworthiness.
Indeed, EMEs have been taking important steps in this direction since the mid1990s. And this has gone hand in hand with a better external balance sheet
structure, helping to reduce their vulnerability to external factors, including through
considerably stronger net international investment positions, substantial increases
in their foreign exchange reserves and a higher FDI share.48
International cooperation that addresses global linkages must supplement
domestic policies. The special roles of global financial institutions and global
currencies transcend international trade and the financial interactions directly
linked to it in the first two layers. An internationally agreed joint regulatory
approach is needed to ensure that policymakers properly manage global financial
risks, not least those associated with the highly procyclical third layer. Because
policies and actions of individual countries affect others, multilateralism is key for
delivering the best outcomes for all.
As regards global financial institutions, the first priority is to complete the
international financial reforms already under way. These reforms will go a long way
to boosting the resilience of the global financial system. An agreed global
regulatory framework is the basis for effective supervision of internationally active
banks, including mechanisms for cross-border information-sharing. And it fosters a
level playing field, a precondition for efficiency and soundness at the global level.
As regards global currencies, effective crisis management mechanisms remain
important, and naturally require international cooperation. Central banks have built
on the successful cooperation during the GFC. Among the central banks of major
currency areas, foreign currency swap lines exist or could be established quickly as
needed. And there may be some room to strengthen these mechanisms further,
even though risk management and governance issues loom large. However, a
greater emphasis on preventing the build-up of financial imbalances appears
desirable. At a minimum, this would mean taking more systematic account of
spillovers and spillbacks when setting policies.49
International cooperation is also needed beyond finance to ensure a level
playing field in trade and areas such as tax. Multilateral trade agreements provide

BIS 87th Annual Report

113

the largest common markets to maximise efficiency. Trade and financial linkages
enable companies, particularly large multinationals, to make decisions regarding
production and profit declaration to minimise their taxes. Avoiding this can ensure
that highly mobile capital can share the tax burden with less mobile labour, and so
address income inequality. Together, such well designed domestic and international
actions can ensure that globalisation continues to be a greatly beneficial force for
the world economy and people’s living standards.

Box VI.C

Globalisation and interest rate spillovers

Increased globalisation has coincided with a significant rise in the co-movement of global asset prices. For example,
the correlation of advanced economy sovereign 10-year yields in the past two decades more than doubled relative
to the previous two. Given the myriad of changes in real and financial linkages between countries, it is difficult to
assess whether asset price co-movement reflects common factors or spillovers from specific countries. One way to
disentangle this is to examine the response of international asset prices to an unexpected development (“shock”)
that clearly emanates from one country.
A useful shock is monetary policy announcements, as they are primarily related to domestic conditions.
Because asset prices incorporate all expected developments, the shock must be measured as the unexpected
change in monetary policy and include information about the future policy path. The response of interest rates to
a monetary policy shock in a foreign country is assessed by regressing the daily change in the domestic interest rate
on the foreign policy shock, which is identified from the change in short- and long-term foreign interest rates in a
25-minute window around a policy announcement. The response of one- and six-month and two- and 10-year
interest rates is analysed for a panel of 47 advanced economies and EMEs.
The results point to significant spillovers across countries, in particular for longer-term interest rates and from the
United States. For example, 10-year bond yields in 34 of the 47 countries display a statistically significant response to

US shocks, compared with around half this number for euro interest rate shocks and only five to eight countries for
shocks from five other advanced economy central banks. These responses are also economically significant: for the
median country, long-term yields rise 4 basis points in response to a 10 basis point increase in the US term premia.
The prominence of US monetary policy announcements relates to the pre-eminent role of the US dollar in international
financial markets. The international spillovers are also clearly larger for longer-term interest rates. For one- and sixmonth interest rates, only eight countries display significant spillovers from US interest rates. In contrast, for two- and
10-year bond yields, 23 and 34 countries have significant responses, respectively (Graph VI.C, left-hand panel).
Interest rate spillovers are more closely related to financial openness than trade openness. The intensity of
interest rate spillovers shows no relationship with trade openness, measured as the trade-to-GDP ratio (Graph VI.C,
centre panel). In contrast, it correlates with measures of financial openness. For example, there is a statistically
significant relationship between the intensity of interest rate spillovers and financial openness, measured by the
ratio of international portfolio debt assets to GDP (Graph VI.C, right-hand panel).

the first shock (referred to as the “path shock”); and (iii) the change in the 10-year bond yield that is orthogonal to the first two shocks
(referred to as the “term premium shock”).

This chapter does not deal with migration flows across national borders, another important
dimension of globalisation. Borjas (2015) reviews the potential gains to GDP that could accrue
from migration. Obviously, there would be many practical impediments to realising these gains.
Furthermore, this chapter uses de facto measures of real and financial openness, which are based
on observed outcomes, rather than de jure measures, which are based on rules and legal
restrictions. De facto measures generally provide a better indicator of actual openness, as de jure
measures fail to take into account the effectiveness of controls or implicit protection.

around one third in advanced economies, based on calculations from the data used by Casas et al

For example, the sales of US multinationals’ subsidiaries are spread wide, going to: their home
market (over half), third countries (one third) and the United States (11%) (Antràs and Yeaple
(2014)). Multinationals not only engage in more FDI and trade, but also spread technology by
concentrating research and development in the parent and production in subsidiaries (Keller
(2010)). In this second layer, transfer of knowledge and ideas can promote trade, but also act as a
substitute for trade, an idea taken up by Baldwin (2016).

Dabla-Norris et al (2015) find that a higher income share for the top 20% reduces growth (but a
higher share for the bottom 20% boosts growth), while Ostry et al (2014) come to the same
conclusion using a Gini coefficient to measure inequality. Halter et al (2014) suggest that inequality
boosts growth in the short run but not in the long run.

26

See Cline (1997) and IMF (2007).

27

On trade and growth there are many papers, including Frankel and Romer (1999), Irwin and Terviö
(2002), Lee et al (2004) and Noguer and Siscart (2005). Broda and Weinstein (2006) show that
increased variety of goods is an important source of gains from trade.

28

Kose et al (2006) provide an extensive review and conclude that the benefits are indirect and
difficult to measure. Rodrik and Subramanian (2009) and references therein summarise the lack of
firm evidence for substantive benefits from financial globalisation. Some research, however, does
find that financial and capital market liberalisation boosts growth, eg Alfaro et al (2004), Bekaert et
al (2005) and Klein and Olivei (2008).

29

See Faijgelbaum and Khandelwal (2016).

30

Beck et al (2007) conclude that greater access to finance increased incomes of the poor. This has
been confirmed recently by Ben Naceur and Zhang (2016) for most measures of financial
development, but not for financial liberalisation. Reduced restrictions on bank operations can also
boost incomes of poorer households, as shown in Beck et al (2010).

31

See Claessens and Perotti (2007) for a summary.

32

Autor et al (2017) find evidence that the fall in the labour share is driven largely by between-firm
reallocation rather than by a fall in the unweighted mean labour share within firms. They link this
finding to the evidence that the most productive firms in each industry are the biggest beneficiaries
of globalisation.

33

That financial openness increases income inequality is a fairly uniform finding in the literature. On
this topic, see eg Cabral et al (2016), Figini and Görg (2011), IMF (2007) and Jaumotte et al (2013).
This finding is not dominated by EMEs. For example, even for OECD countries, Denk and Cournède
(2015) find that financial expansion increased income inequality and there is no evidence that this
results from financial crises.

34

While many studies find that trade openness has reduced inequality (Jaumotte et al (2013), IMF
(2007)), and probably lowered unemployment (Görg (2011)), this contrasts with the review of
country studies by Goldberg and Pavcnik (2007). These opposing conclusions may reflect that
other factors influence the relationship between trade and inequality. For example, Milanović
(2005) finds that trade openness reduces the income share of the poor at low income levels, but
raises it at higher country income levels.

Borio et al (2011) outline the role that international capital can play in facilitating domestic
financial excess. Most studies find that financial crises increase inequality: see Bazillier and
Héricourt (2014), de Haan and Sturm (2017), Atkinson and Morelli (2011), Baldacci et al (2002) and
Li and Yu (2014); although others do not: see Denk and Cournède (2015), Honohan (2005) and
Jaumotte and Osorio Buitron (2015). In part, these differences may reflect the fact that the impact
of crises on inequality is seemingly greater for EMEs than for advanced economies; see Galbraith
and Jiaqing (1999) and Agnello and Sousa (2012). Chen and Ravallion (2010) note the significant
impact that financial crises have on poverty.

For additional empirical evidence on the procyclicality of capital flows with respect to domestic
GDP growth, see Broner et al (2013), Contessi et al (2013), Bluedorn et al (2013), Hoggarth et al
(2016) and Avdjiev et al (2017b). Hoggarth et al (2016) also examine the procyclicality of capital
flows with respect to domestic credit. For additional empirical evidence on the procyclicality of
capital flows with respect to global factors, see Koepke (2015), Nier et al (2014) and Eichengreen et
al (2017).

BIS 87th Annual Report

The BIS: mission, activities, governance and
financial results

The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) serves central banks in their pursuit of
monetary and financial stability, fosters international cooperation in those areas
and acts as a bank for central banks. In outline, the BIS pursues this mission by:
•
facilitating dialogue and collaboration among central banks and other authorities
that are responsible for promoting financial stability;
•
conducting research on policy issues confronting central banks and financial
supervisory authorities;
•
acting as a prime counterparty for central banks in their financial transactions; and
•
serving as an agent or trustee in connection with international financial operations.
The BIS has its head office in Basel, Switzerland, and representative offices in
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China
(Hong Kong SAR) and in Mexico City.
In the light of the above aims, this chapter reviews the BIS’s activities, and those
of the groups it hosts, for the financial year 2016/17; describes the institutional
framework that supports their work; and presents the year’s financial results.

The Basel Process
The Basel Process refers to the way in which the BIS promotes international cooperation
among monetary authorities and financial supervisory officials. By offering a forum for
discussion among central banks and other financial authorities, and by hosting and
supporting international groups, the BIS, through the Basel Process, plays a key role in
helping to strengthen the stability and resilience of the global financial system.

Bimonthly meetings and other regular consultations
Governors and other senior officials of BIS member central banks hold bimonthly
meetings, normally in Basel, to discuss current developments and the outlook for
the world economy and financial markets. They also exchange views and experiences
on issues of interest to central banks.

Global Economy Meeting
The Global Economy Meeting (GEM) comprises the Governors of 30 BIS member
central banks in major advanced and emerging market economies (EMEs) that
account for about four fifths of global GDP. The Governors of another 19 central
banks attend the GEM as observers.1  Chaired by Agustín Carstens, Governor of the

1

The members of the GEM are from the central banks of Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil,
Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong SAR, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Korea, Malaysia,
Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States and also the ECB. The
observers are from the central banks of Algeria, Austria, Chile, Colombia, the Czech Republic,
Denmark, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, the
Philippines, Portugal, Romania and the United Arab Emirates.

BIS 87th Annual Report

137

Bank of Mexico, the GEM has two main roles: (i) monitoring and assessing
developments, risks and opportunities in the world economy and the global
financial system; and (ii) providing guidance to three BIS-based central bank
committees – the Committee on the Global Financial System, the Committee on
Payments and Market Infrastructures and the Markets Committee.
The GEM’s economic discussions focus on current macroeconomic and financial
developments in major advanced and emerging market economies. Specific topics
discussed by the GEM over the past year included: snapback risks in core bond
markets; inflation targets; consumption-led expansion; and the mix of monetary,
fiscal and structural policies.

Economic Consultative Committee
The Economic Consultative Committee (ECC) is an 18-member group that supports
the work of the GEM. Also led by the GEM Chairman and comprising all Governors
participating in the BIS Board meeting, and the BIS General Manager, the ECC
conducts analyses and prepares proposals for the GEM’s consideration. In addition,
the ECC Chairman makes recommendations to the GEM on the appointment
of Chairs of the three central bank committees mentioned above and on the
composition and organisation of those committees.

All Governors’ Meeting
The All Governors’ Meeting comprises the Governors of the 60 BIS member central
banks and is chaired by the Chairman of the Board. It convenes to discuss selected
topics of general interest to its members. In 2016/17, the topics discussed were
foreign exchange market intervention; the issues arising from cyber risk for central
banks; promoting economic resilience; the macroeconomic implications of global
value chains; and global dollar intermediation: patterns and risks.
By agreement with the GEM and the BIS Board, the All Governors’ Meeting is
responsible for overseeing the work of two other groups that have a broader
network or membership than the GEM. These are the Central Bank Governance
Group, which also meets during the bimonthly meetings, and the Irving Fisher
Committee on Central Bank Statistics.

Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision
The Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS) is a highlevel forum responsible for international collaboration on banking supervision.
Chaired by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, the GHOS meets periodically to
decide on global banking regulations and oversee the work of the Basel Committee
on Banking Supervision (see page 140).

Other meetings of Governors
The central bank Governors of major EMEs meet three times a year – during the
January, May and September bimonthly meetings – to discuss issues of importance
to their economies. The topics discussed in 2016/17 included inflationary and
deflationary pressures, challenges facing banks in EMEs, and the implications of
political events on the outlook for EMEs.
Regular meetings were also held for the Governors of central banks in small
open economies.

138

BIS 87th Annual Report

Other consultations
In addition, the Bank regularly organises various meetings that bring together
senior central bank officials and, occasionally, representatives from other financial
authorities, the private financial sector and the academic community to discuss
topics of shared interest. Some of these meetings are organised by the BIS’s
representative offices in Hong Kong SAR and Mexico City.
During the past year, these events included:
•
the annual meetings of the working parties on monetary policy, held in Basel
but also hosted at a regional level by central banks in Asia, central and eastern
Europe, and Latin America;
•
a meeting of Deputy Governors of EMEs on macroprudential frameworks; and
•
the high-level meetings organised by the Financial Stability Institute in various
regions of the world for senior officials of central banks and supervisory
authorities.

BIS-hosted committees and associations
The BIS hosts and supports a set of international groups – six committees and three
associations – engaged in standard setting and the pursuit of financial stability. Colocation at the BIS facilitates communication and collaboration among these
groups as well as their interaction with central bank Governors and other senior
officials in the context of the BIS’s regular meetings programme.
The limited size of these groups is conducive to flexibility and openness in the
exchange of information, thereby facilitating coordination and preventing overlaps
and gaps in their work programmes. The BIS also supports the work of these
committees and associations with its expertise in economic research and statistics
and its practical experience in banking.
The hosted committees, whose agendas are guided by various sets of central
banks and supervisory authorities, are as follows:
•
the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS): develops global
regulatory standards for banks and seeks to strengthen micro- and
macroprudential supervision;
•
the Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS): monitors and analyses
issues relating to financial markets and systems;
•
the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI): analyses and
sets standards for payment, clearing and settlement infrastructures;
•
the Markets Committee: monitors developments in financial markets and their
implications for central bank operations;
•
the Central Bank Governance Group: examines issues related to the design and
operation of central banks; and
•
the Irving Fisher Committee on Central Bank Statistics (IFC): addresses statistical
issues relating to economic, monetary and financial stability.
The hosted associations are as follows:
•
the Financial Stability Board (FSB): an association including finance ministries,
central banks and other financial authorities in 25 countries; coordinates the
work of national authorities and international standard setters and develops
policies to enhance financial stability;
•
the International Association of Deposit Insurers (IADI): sets global standards
for deposit insurance systems and promotes cooperation on deposit insurance
and bank resolution arrangements; and
•
the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS): sets standards for
the insurance sector to promote globally consistent supervision.

BIS 87th Annual Report

139

The Bank’s own Financial Stability Institute (FSI) facilitates the dissemination of
the standard-setting bodies’ work to central banks and financial sector supervisory
and regulatory agencies through its extensive programme of meetings, seminars
and online tutorials.

Activities of BIS-hosted committees and the FSI
This section reviews the year’s principal activities of the six committees hosted by
the BIS and of the Financial Stability Institute.

Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) is the primary global standard
setter for the prudential regulation of banks and provides a forum for cooperation
on banking supervisory matters. Its mandate is to strengthen the regulation,
supervision and practices of banks worldwide with the purpose of enhancing global
financial stability.
The Committee consists of senior representatives of banking supervisory
authorities and central banks responsible for banking supervision or financial
stability in the Committee’s member jurisdictions. It is chaired by Stefan Ingves,
Governor of Sveriges Riksbank, and generally meets four times a year. The
Committee reports to the Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS)
and seeks its endorsement for major decisions and strategic priorities.

Current work programme
During the past year, the Basel Committee made substantial progress in finalising
its Basel III post-crisis reforms. The post-crisis reforms are aimed at reducing
excessive variability in risk-weighted assets (RWAs), with a view to restoring the
credibility of the risk-weighted framework.
In addition, the Committee continued to promote strong supervision, effective
cooperation and full, timely and consistent implementation of the Basel regulatory
framework.
The key themes of the Committee’s current work programme and strategic
priorities are:
•
Finalising ongoing policy initiatives: this includes key policy issues related to
accounting provisions, the assessment methodology for global systemically
important banks and the regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures.
•
Monitoring emerging risks and exploring appropriate responses: the
Committee will continue to monitor risks and behavioural changes in the
banking system from a micro- and macroprudential perspective and develop
appropriate supervisory and policy responses as needed.
•
Assessing the implementation and impact of the Committee’s post-crisis
reforms: the Committee will build on its existing assessment of the impact of
its post-crisis reforms, particularly regarding their effectiveness in reducing
excessive variability of RWAs. The Committee will continue its monitoring and
assessment of its members’ implementation of Basel standards.
•
Promoting strong supervision: this work aims to (i) foster the timely, consistent
and effective implementation of the Committee’s standards and guidelines; and
(ii) seek improvements in practices and principles in banking supervision,
particularly in Basel Committee member countries, by identifying emerging risks
and supervisory challenges; developing and implementing supervisory policies;

140

BIS 87th Annual Report

improving supervisory tools and techniques; promoting cooperation and
coordination; and supporting assessments of supervisory effectiveness.

Policy reform
The Committee finalised or issued for consultation a number of global standards
for banks during the year.
Standardised measurement approach for operational risk. Issued in March 2016, this
updated consultative document sets out revised proposals that emerged from the
Committee’s broad review of the capital framework. Revisions to the standardised
approaches for calculating operational risk capital charges were originally proposed
in October 2014. The revised framework will be based on a single non-model-based
approach for the estimation of operational risk capital requirements. Building on
the simplicity and comparability of a standardised approach, the new proposal
embodies the risk sensitivity of an advanced approach. The combination, in a
standardised way, of financial statement information and banks’ internal loss
experience is designed to promote consistency and comparability in operational
risk capital measurement.
Pillar 3 disclosure requirements: consolidated and enhanced framework. Published in
March 2016, the proposed enhancements issued in this consultation build on
revisions to the Pillar 3 disclosure requirements that the Committee finalised in
January 2015. Taken together, they form the consolidated and enhanced Pillar 3
framework, which seeks to promote market discipline through regulatory disclosure
requirements.
Reducing variation in credit risk-weighted assets: constraints on the use of internal
model approaches. This consultative document, issued in March 2016, sets out the
Committee’s proposed changes to the advanced and foundation internal ratingsbased (IRB) approaches. The proposed changes include a number of complementary
measures that aim to (i) reduce the complexity of the regulatory framework and
improve comparability; and (ii) address excessive variability in the capital
requirements for credit risk. Specifically, the Committee proposed to (i) remove the
option to use the IRB approaches for certain exposures where it is judged that the
model parameters cannot be estimated with sufficient reliability for regulatory
capital purposes; (ii) adopt floors on the model parameters at the exposure level
to ensure a minimum of conservatism for portfolios where the IRB approaches
remain available; and (iii) provide greater specification of parameter estimation
practices to reduce variability in RWAs for portfolios where the IRB approaches
remain available.
Revisions to the Basel III leverage ratio framework. This consultation document,
issued in April 2016, sets out the Committee’s proposed revisions to the design and
calibration of the Basel III leverage ratio framework, which introduced a simple,
transparent, non-risk-based leverage ratio to act as a supplementary measure to
the risk-based capital requirement. The proposed changes have been informed by
the monitoring process in the parallel run period since 2013, and by feedback from
market participants and stakeholders received since the January 2014 release of the
standard Basel III leverage ratio framework and disclosure requirements.
Interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB). Published in April 2016, this standard
revises the Committee’s 2004 Principles for the management and supervision of

BIS 87th Annual Report

141

interest rate risk, which set out supervisory expectations for banks’ identification,
measurement, monitoring and control of IRRBB as well as its supervision. It reflects
changes in market and supervisory practices since the Principles were first
published, and is a measure that is particularly pertinent in the light of the current
exceptionally low interest rates in many jurisdictions. The revised standard is
expected to be implemented by 2018.
Revisions to the securitisation framework. In July 2016, the Committee published an
updated standard for the regulatory capital treatment of securitisation exposures
that includes the regulatory capital treatment for “simple, transparent and
comparable” (STC) securitisations. This amends the Committee’s 2014 capital
standards for securitisations and sets out additional criteria for differentiating the
capital treatment of STC securitisations from that of other securitisation transactions.
Regulatory treatment of accounting provisions. In October 2016, the Committee
released in parallel a consultative document and a discussion paper on the policy
considerations related to the regulatory treatment of accounting provisions under
the Basel III regulatory capital framework. Accounting standard boards have
adopted provisioning standards that require the use of expected credit loss (ECL)
models rather than incurred loss models. These new accounting standards modify
provisioning standards to incorporate forward-looking assessments in the
estimation of credit losses. The consultative document sets out proposals to retain,
for an interim period, the current regulatory treatment of provisions under the
standardised and the IRB approaches. The discussion paper seeks input on policy
options for the long-term regulatory treatment of provisions under the new ECL
standards.
TLAC holdings standard. This document, released in October 2016, is the final
standard on the regulatory capital treatment of banks’ investments in instruments
that comprise total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) for global systemically important
banks (G-SIBs). The standard aims to reduce the risk of contagion within the
financial system should a G-SIB enter resolution. It applies to both G-SIBs and nonG-SIBs that hold such investments. The standard also reflects changes to Basel III to
specify how G-SIBs must take account of the TLAC requirement when calculating
their regulatory capital buffers.
The Committee also published a series of responses to frequently asked
questions. These covered:
•
market risk capital requirements;
•
the Basel III leverage ratio framework;
•
the revised Pillar 3 disclosure requirements;
•
the supervisory framework for measuring and controlling large exposures; and
•
the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR).

Policy implementation
Implementation of the regulatory framework remains a key priority for the Committee.
The Regulatory Consistency Assessment Programme (RCAP) monitors progress by
Committee member jurisdictions on implementation and assesses the consistency and
completeness of the adopted standards. The RCAP also facilitates dialogue among
Committee members and assists the Committee in developing standards.
During the year, RCAP jurisdictional assessments were conducted for Argentina,
Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Russia, Singapore and Turkey. The frameworks for SIBs
were reviewed in member jurisdictions that are home to G-SIBs: China, the European

142

BIS 87th Annual Report

Union, Japan, Switzerland and the United States. The Committee completed its
review of the implementation of the risk-based capital framework by all its members
in December 2016. Work is under way to assess the consistency of capital and the
Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) regulations in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the
European Union, Switzerland and the United States.
In addition, the Committee published several other reports relating to the
implementation of the Basel framework.
RCAP: Analysis of risk-weighted assets for credit risk in the banking book. This report
is the second to analyse variations in RWAs in banks using internal ratings-based
models to calculate credit risk capital requirements. The report also describes sound
practices observed in the independent model validation functions of banks,
including the governance of the validation process, the methodology and scope of
banks’ validation functions, and the role of the validation function across different
phases of model development and implementation.
Progress reports on adoption of the Basel regulatory framework. Issued in April and
October 2016, these semiannual reports provide a high-level view of Basel
Committee members’ progress in adopting Basel III standards. The reports focus on
the status of domestic rule-making to ensure that the Basel standards are turned
into national law or regulation according to the internationally agreed time frames.
The reports cover the Basel III risk-based capital standards, the leverage ratio, the
LCR, the NSFR, the SIB frameworks, Pillar 3 disclosure requirements and the large
exposure framework.
Report to G20 Leaders on implementation of the Basel III regulatory reforms. This
report, issued in August 2016, updated G20 Leaders on progress and challenges in
the implementation of the Basel III regulatory reforms since November 2015, when
the Committee last reported to the G20. It summarises the steps taken by the
Committee’s member jurisdictions to adopt the Basel III standards, banks’ progress
in bolstering their capital and liquidity positions, the consistency of implementation
in jurisdictions assessed since the Committee’s last report and the Committee’s
implementation work plan.
RCAP: Handbook for Jurisdictional Assessments. Based on experience with the RCAP
to date, the Committee updated the procedures and process for conducting
jurisdictional assessments under the RCAP in one document, the Handbook for
Jurisdictional Assessments, published in March 2016. The Handbook describes the
assessment methodology and also introduces the RCAP questionnaires that
member jurisdictions complete ahead of the assessment. The Handbook and the
RCAP questionnaires will help regulators, supervisors and financial stability
authorities to evaluate their own progress in the implementation of the Basel III
framework and identify areas for improvement. These documents will be kept
under review and updated as the scope of the RCAP expands to include other
aspects of the Basel III framework.
Basel III monitoring. The Committee published two monitoring reports, in
September 2016 and February 2017, as part of the rigorous reporting process to
regularly review the implications of the Basel III standards. The results of previous
exercises have been published since 2012, in twice-yearly reports. With data as of
30 June 2016, on a fully phased-in basis, the latest report shows that virtually all
participating banks meet both the Basel III risk-based capital minimum Common
Equity Tier 1 (CET1) requirement of 4.5% and the target level CET1 requirement of

BIS 87th Annual Report

143

7.0% when including the capital conservation buffer (plus the surcharges on G-SIBs
as applicable).

Supervision
During the year, the Committee published several documents to aid supervisors in
undertaking effective supervision of banks.
Prudential treatment of problem assets: definitions of non-performing exposures and
forbearance. Issued in April 2016, the definitions proposed in this consultation
document aim to foster harmonisation in the measurement and application of two
important measures of asset quality, thereby promoting consistency in supervisory
reporting and disclosures by banks. Hitherto, banks have categorised problem
loans in a variety of ways, and therefore consistent international standards for
categorising problem loans are lacking.
Guidance on the application of the Core principles for effective banking supervision
to the regulation and supervision of institutions relevant to financial inclusion. Issued
in September 2016, this document builds on past work by the Committee to
elaborate additional guidance in the application of the Committee’s Core principles
to the supervision of financial institutions that provide services to the hitherto
financially unserved and underserved. This work includes a report on the Range of
practice in the regulation and supervision of institutions relevant to financial
inclusion, and expands on Microfinance activities and the Core principles for effective
banking supervision.
Revisions to the annex on correspondent banking. In this document, published in
November 2016, the Committee consults on proposed revisions that are consistent
with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) guidance on Correspondent banking
services issued in October 2016 and serve the same purpose of clarifying rules
applicable to banks conducting correspondent banking activities. They form part of
a broader international initiative to assess and address the decline in correspondent
banking.

Committee on the Global Financial System
The Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS) monitors financial market
developments for the Governors of the BIS Global Economy Meeting and analyses
the implications for financial stability and central bank policy. Chaired by William C
Dudley, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Committee
comprises Deputy Governors and other senior officials from 23 central banks of
major advanced and emerging market economies, as well as the Head of the BIS’s
Monetary and Economic Department and its Economic Adviser.
In the past year, the Committee’s conjunctural discussions focused on topics
relating to asset prices and the financial activity of financial and non-financial firms. It
monitored the implications for financial stability of bond and equity valuations and
of currency market conditions as they relate to global demand for US dollar funding.
It examined banking sector profitability, the changing patterns of capital flows, and
the management of corporate balance sheets in terms of cash management and
debt issuance. It discussed the potential risks from yield curve steepening in view of
signs of increasing inflation expectations and an uptick in longer-term rates.

144

BIS 87th Annual Report

Additionally, in-depth studies are commissioned from groups of central bank
experts. Three such reports were published in 2016/17. Two of them pertain to the
Committee’s ongoing interest in topics related to macroprudential policy. The report
on Experiences with the ex ante appraisal of macroprudential instruments provides
an overview of central banks’ experiences with methodologies used to assess the
effect of instruments; with the selection of the appropriate policy instrument, its
calibration and its timing; and with the assessment of financial risks and vulnerabilities.
The second report, on Objective-setting and communication of macroprudential
policies, argues that adopting a systematic policy framework that channels
policymaking through a set of predictable procedures can help address these
challenges. A key part of such a framework is a communication strategy that clearly
explains how macroprudential actions can contribute to achieving financial stability.
The report provides an overview of how objectives are set in macroprudential policy
and how policy is communicated in practice. One of the report’s conclusions is that
explaining the macroprudential policy framework facilitates policy actions early on
in the cycle, when instruments may be more effective and adjustment less costly.
The report on Designing frameworks for central bank liquidity assistance:
addressing new challenges was motivated by the recognition that central banks have
made advances in building capacity to deal with future systemic crises, but a number
of open issues remain that are related to the provision of liquidity assistance. The
report presents eight principles in three areas: the provision of liquidity assistance to
internationally active financial intermediaries, transparency on liquidity assistance
operations, and the provision of assistance to a market. The report underlines the
need for central banks to enhance preparedness in calm times and, in particular, to
consider how the interaction of national frameworks might affect cross-border
coordination and assistance, and how they might engage ex ante in bilateral
discussions to facilitate the timely execution of an operation when necessary.

Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures
The Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) promotes the
safety and efficiency of payment, clearing, settlement and reporting systems and
arrangements. The CPMI is a global standard setter in this field. It also serves as a
forum for central banks to monitor and analyse developments and cooperate in
related oversight, policy and operational matters, including the provision of central
bank services. Chaired by Benoît Cœuré, a member of the ECB’s Executive Board,
the Committee comprises senior officials from 25 central banks.

Monitoring implementation of standards for financial market infrastructures
The CPMI-IOSCO Principles for financial market infrastructures (PFMI), published in
April 2012 together with the International Organization of Securities Commissions,
set out international regulatory standards for systemically important financial
market infrastructures (FMIs) and specify the responsibilities for the authorities that
oversee, supervise or regulate them.
Monitoring the implementation of the PFMI, a high priority for the CPMI,
involves three phases: Level 1, on the adoption of the PFMI in domestic regulatory
frameworks; Level 2, on the completeness and consistency of these regulatory
frameworks; and Level 3, on the consistency in the outcomes of the PFMI
implementation across jurisdictions.

BIS 87th Annual Report

145

Level 1: In June 2016, the CPMI and IOSCO published a third update to the Level 1
assessments, which showed that the 28 participating jurisdictions continue to make
good progress in implementing the PFMI. In particular, the report highlighted that
19 of them had completed their implementation measures for all FMI types, up
from 15 jurisdictions in 2015.
Level 2: In June 2016, the CPMI and IOSCO started Level 2 assessments of
implementation measures applicable to all FMI types in Hong Kong SAR and
Singapore. Reports are scheduled to be published in the first half of 2017.
Level 3: In August 2016, the CPMI and IOSCO published Implementation monitoring
of PFMI: Level 3 assessment – Report on the financial risk management and recovery
practices of 10 derivatives CCPs. The assessment found that central counterparties
(CCPs) have made important progress in implementing arrangements consistent
with the standards. Some gaps and shortcomings were nevertheless identified,
notably in the areas of recovery planning and credit and liquidity risk management.
The report also identified a number of differences in the outcomes of implementation
across CCPs.

CCP resilience and recovery
The CPMI and IOSCO published in August 2016 a consultative report outlining
further guidance on financial risk management and recovery planning for CCPs.
The report is based on the workplan agreed in April 2015 by the BCBS, CPMI, FSB
and IOSCO to coordinate their respective international policy work on the resilience,
recovery planning and resolvability of CCPs and to work in close collaboration.2

Harmonisation of OTC derivatives data
Since November 2014, the CPMI and IOSCO have been working to develop
guidance on the harmonisation of key over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives data,
including uniform transaction and product identifiers. Following three consultative
reports in 2015, the group published further consultation reports, on the
Harmonisation of the Unique Product Identifier in August 2016 and on the
Harmonisation of critical OTC derivatives data elements (other than UTI and UPI) –
second batch in October 2016.

Retail payments
Published in November 2016, the report on Fast payments sets out key characteristics
of fast retail payments, defined as payments that make funds immediately available
to the payee on a 24/7 basis. It takes stock of various initiatives in CPMI jurisdictions,
analyses supply and demand factors that may foster or hinder their development,
discusses the benefits and risks, and examines the potential implications for
different stakeholders, in particular central banks.

Correspondent banking
The CPMI’s report on Correspondent banking, published in July 2016, provides basic
definitions, outlines the main types of correspondent banking arrangement,

BIS 87th Annual Report

summarises recent developments and touches on the underlying drivers. The report
sets out recommendations on technical measures relating to (i) know-yourcustomer (KYC) utilities; (ii) use of the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) in correspondent
banking; (iii) information-sharing initiatives; (iv) payment messages; and (v) use of
the LEI as additional information in payment messages.

Cyber resilience in FMIs
Building on their previous separate work on cyber resilience, the CPMI and IOSCO
established a joint working group on cyber resilience for FMIs in December 2014
with a view to considering additional guidance and identifying other relevant
issues. After public consultation, the Guidance on cyber resilience for financial
market infrastructures (“Cyber Guidance”) was published in June 2016. In accordance
with the Cyber Guidance, FMIs are expected to take immediate steps, in concert
with relevant stakeholders, to improve their cyber resilience. Notably, the Cyber
Guidance calls for the development, within 12 months of its publication, of concrete
plans to meet the stringent recovery time objectives applicable to this industry.

Wholesale payments security
In mid-2016, the CPMI started to look into the security of wholesale payments in
the light of the recent increase in cyber fraud. With this work, the CPMI aims to
ensure that adequate protections and controls are in place at each stage of the
wholesale payments process. This effort builds on previous CPMI work on cyber
security and operational risk and, more generally, existing procedures to continuously
test and strengthen infrastructure.

Digital innovations
In 2016, the CPMI began work on the potential effects of digital innovations in
payment, clearing and settlement systems. The CPMI hosted an industry workshop
with the FSB in October on the use of distributed ledger technologies in the
financial markets and issues for financial authorities. This was followed by the
publication of the CPMI report on Distributed ledger technology in payment,
clearing and settlement: an analytical framework in February 2017. The report is
designed to help central banks and other authorities to review and analyse the use
of distributed ledgers in this part of the financial system.

Payment aspects of financial inclusion
The final report on Payment aspects of financial inclusion was published in April 2016.
Setting out guiding principles designed to assist countries that seek to advance
financial inclusion in their markets through payment services and technology, the
report was produced by a joint task force set up by the CPMI and the World Bank
Group in mid-2014.

Red Book statistics
The CPMI published in December 2016 its annual update of the Statistics on
payment, clearing and settlement systems in the CPMI countries.

Markets Committee
The Markets Committee is a forum where senior central bank officials jointly
monitor developments in financial markets and assess their implications for market
functioning and central bank operations. With a membership of 21 central banks,
the Committee is chaired by Jacqueline Loh, Deputy Managing Director at the
Monetary Authority of Singapore. She succeeded Guy Debelle, Deputy Governor
of the Reserve Bank of Australia, who served as the Committee’s Chair until
January 2017.
The Committee’s discussions during the year focused on changes in the
monetary policy stance by the major central banks as well as on policy and financial
conditions in EMEs. Among the topics discussed were unconventional policy
measures and their implications for market functioning, exchange rate movements,
digital innovations and their potential impact on monetary policy operations
and the impact of money market fund reform on short-term US dollar funding
markets.
In December 2016, the Committee issued a report on Market intelligence
gathering at central banks, with the aim of shedding light on their efforts to gain a
better understanding of market functioning. It shows that market intelligence
gathering can be conducted via a number of different models depending on the
central bank and its remit, size and resources. A key focus is on the recent evolution
of such activity, in terms of the markets and institutions about which market
intelligence is gathered, as well as on the organisational models for its collection,
synthesis and dissemination.
In January 2017, the Committee issued a report on The sterling “flash event” of
7 October 2016. Investigating the sudden sell-off in sterling during early Asian
trading that day, the report points to a confluence of factors that catalysed the
episode. Significant weight is placed on the time of day and mechanistic amplifiers,
including options-related hedging flows, as contributory factors. The report notes
that the 7 October event does not represent a new phenomenon, but rather a new
example of what appears to be a series of flash events that are now apt to occur in
a broader range of markets than before.
In addition to monitoring near-term developments, the Committee also
considered longer-term structural and operational issues. It oversaw work on the
foreign exchange part of the 2016 Triennial Central Bank Survey of Foreign
Exchange and Derivatives Market Activity. Based on these data, the Committee
discussed the implications of the evolution of the market ecosystem for market
functioning. The Committee continued its work of producing a single global code
of conduct for the foreign exchange market, collaborating with a group of market
participants from the major financial centres in both advanced and emerging
market economies. The code, together with proposals for measures that would
ensure greater adherence to the code, is scheduled to be finalised in May 2017.

Central Bank Governance Group
The Central Bank Governance Group is a venue for Governors to exchange views on
the design and operation of their institutions. The focus is on the institutional and
organisational setting in which central banks perform their functions, including the
choice of functions, independence of decision-making and decision-making
structures. The group comprises nine Governors and is currently chaired by Stefan
Ingves, Governor of Sveriges Riksbank.

148

BIS 87th Annual Report

Discussions are based on information collected through the Central Bank
Governance Network, comprising almost 50 of the BIS member central banks. This
and other information is made available to central bank officials. Selected examples
of this research are published.
In the past year, the Governance Group convened during several BIS bimonthly
meetings to discuss, among other topics, conflicts of interest relating to payment
system functions, appointment and dismissal arrangements for top central bank
officials, trends in profitability, and parliamentary oversight mechanisms. The
information and insights provided help central banks assess the effectiveness of
their own arrangements as well as the alternatives available.
Central Bank Governance Group: www.bis.org/cbgov

Irving Fisher Committee on Central Bank Statistics
The Irving Fisher Committee on Central Bank Statistics (IFC) is a forum for central
bank economists and statisticians to address statistical topics related to monetary
and financial stability. Governed by the BIS member central banks, it is hosted by
the BIS and associated with the International Statistical Institute (ISI). The IFC has 85
institutional members, including almost all BIS shareholder central banks, and is
currently chaired by Claudia Buch, Vice President of the Deutsche Bundesbank.
The IFC organised several activities in 2016/17 with the support of its member
central banks and a number of international organisations. A key event was the
Eighth Biennial Conference of central bank statisticians, on “Statistical implications
of the new financial landscape” in September 2016. Together with the European
Committee of Central Balance Sheet Data Offices (ECCBSO) and the Central Bank of
the Republic of Turkey, the IFC also organised a conference on the “Uses of central
balance sheet data office information” in September 2016. In March 2017, the IFC
participated in the Asian Regional Statistics Conference co-hosted by the ISI and
Bank Indonesia.
A significant part of the IFC’s work has been conducted in cooperation with the
G20-endorsed international Data Gaps Initiative (DGI) to enhance economic and
financial statistics. One key DGI recommendation relates to data-sharing, for which
the IFC was invited to conduct a survey to identify good practices to foster
collaboration and micro data-sharing both within central banks and among public
institutions. A report based on this stocktaking exercise, published in December
2016, served as an input to the international set of recommendations being
prepared for the G20.
Another IFC report published in 2016 related to national policies and practices
for financial inclusion. Its recommendations covered the definition of financial
inclusion, the mandate of central banks in this area, internal coordination, data
gaps to be addressed and international cooperation.
Lastly, and reflecting the strong interest of central banks in the topic of big
data, the Committee has decided to focus on a few pilot projects related to using
new information derived from internet activity and to the various large micro-data
sets that are already available in administrative and commercial records. This
preliminary work was presented at the IFC satellite seminar on big data during the
ISI’s March 2017 meetings.

Financial Stability Institute
The Financial Stability Institute (FSI) assists supervisors worldwide in strengthening
their financial systems by disseminating global financial standards, identifying
relevant policy implementation issues, and facilitating adoption of sound
supervisory practices. The FSI carries out these tasks through outreach events; FSI
Connect, an e-learning tool; and policy implementation work.
In the latter part of 2016/17, the FSI started to implement a new strategy
focused on (i) strengthening its outreach to senior policymakers worldwide;
(ii) enhancing its policy implementation work by increasing the number of FSI
publications and meetings that explore the range of policy options applied by
different jurisdictions on key regulatory and supervisory issues, and highlight the
main practical considerations attending their implementation; and (iii) intensifying
efforts to gather input from key stakeholders to ensure that the FSI’s work continues
to reflect the interests and needs of financial sector supervisory authorities.

Outreach events
FSI outreach events include high-level meetings, policy implementation meetings,
conferences, seminars and webinars. In 2016, more than 2,000 central bankers,
financial sector supervisors and senior industry representatives attended 51 events.

High-level meetings
The FSI organises high-level meetings jointly with the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision (BCBS). These meetings, designed for Deputy Governors of central
banks and heads of supervisory authorities, focus on policy discussions relating to
current and emerging issues in the global and regional financial sector.
In 2016/17, high-level meetings were held in Africa, Latin America, and the
Middle East and North Africa. The topics discussed included the remaining work to
finalise the Basel III framework; supervisory approaches to enhance bank
governance and culture; and the emergence of financial technology and its
implications for banks’ business models and risks.

Policy implementation meetings
Policy implementation meetings are aimed at senior officials at financial authorities
who play key decision-making roles in implementing regulatory policies at the
national level. The purpose of these meetings is to discuss policy and supervisory
issues from a practical perspective.
Six policy implementation meetings were held in 2016. The meetings focused
on topics such as Basel III implementation; expected loss provisioning and its
interaction with regulatory capital; and supervisory approaches to financial
technology innovations.

Conferences, seminars and webinars
These events provide a venue for supervisors around the world to discuss the
technical aspects of financial sector regulation and supervision. Separate events
cover banking, insurance, and cross-sectoral areas.
In 2016, the FSI organised 24 banking-related seminars and webinars. These
included 15 regional events, which were organised in cooperation with 12 regional

150

BIS 87th Annual Report

supervisory groups,3 and two webinars. The main topics covered included regulation
and supervision of different banking risks; approaches to dealing with financial
stability issues; and problem bank identification and early supervisory intervention.
The FSI held seven insurance-related seminars and eight webinars, most of
which were organised in collaboration with the International Association of
Insurance Supervisors (IAIS). The main topics covered were the new solvency and
capital standards for insurers; the policy framework for global systemically
important insurers (G-SIIs); and the emerging resolution framework for insurers.
Three cross-sectoral events were organised jointly with different partner
institutions: a conference with the Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion (GPFI)
on the supervision of digital financial inclusion; a conference with the International
Association of Deposit Insurers (IADI) on bank resolution and deposit insurance;
and a seminar with the International Organization of Securities Commissions
(IOSCO) on trading book and market infrastructure issues.

FSI Connect
FSI Connect offers about 300 tutorials covering a wide range of financial sector
regulatory and supervisory topics. It now has around 10,000 users from about 300
central banks and other financial authorities.
In 2016, the FSI released 37 new and updated tutorials on topics such as the
TLAC standard; the revised market risk framework; the framework for domestic
systemically important banks (D-SIBs); the framework for G-SIIs; and macroprudential
surveillance in insurance.

Policy implementation work
In 2016, the FSI produced two occasional papers. One was developed jointly with
the Association of Supervisors of Banks of the Americas (ASBA), and provided a
qualitative discussion of the current supervisory treatment of interest rate risk in
the banking book in Latin America. The second paper presented the results of a
survey on supervisory priorities and challenges in non-BCBS member jurisdictions.

bodies as they develop strong regulatory, supervisory and other financial sector
policies. It fosters a level playing field by encouraging coherent implementation of
these policies across sectors and jurisdictions. The FSB’s mandate, membership and
framework of committees and management are described in its Annual Report. The
FSB is chaired by Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England.
The FSB was set up by the G20 in 2009 to coordinate the development and
implementation of the package of G20 financial regulatory reforms. The FSB’s
regional consultative groups (RCGs) broaden the range of countries engaged in the
FSB’s work to promote international financial stability. The RCGs bring together FSB
members and approximately 65 non-member jurisdictions to exchange views on
vulnerabilities affecting financial systems and initiatives to promote financial
stability.
During 2016/17, the FSB continued its policy work to address the causes of the
financial crisis, focusing increasingly on implementing the reforms and
understanding their effects.

Reducing the moral hazard posed by global systemically important financial
institutions
G-SIFI identification and higher loss absorbency
The identification of global systemically important financial institutions (G-SIFIs) is
an important step towards understanding which financial institutions pose a risk to
the financial system. Each year, the FSB publishes new lists of G-SIFIs based upon
updated data and using methodologies developed by the BCBS and IAIS. The latest
lists of global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) and global systemically
important insurers (G-SIIs), were published in November 2016. The following
month, the FSB issued a consultation on further guidance to implement the total
loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) standard agreed in November 2015.

G-SIFI resolution
Developing policy for effective recovery and resolution of global financial
institutions is a key part of the FSB’s ongoing work to address the failings
highlighted by the financial crisis. In August 2016, the FSB published its fifth annual
progress report to assess the implementation of agreed reforms and report on the
resolvability of G-SIFIs. The report highlighted steps for FSB jurisdictions to take
when developing policies for effective resolution of G-SIFIs and called for further
action by G20 Leaders on the implementation of effective resolution regimes. The
focus is on developing policy frameworks so that no firm is considered “too big to
fail” and all firms can be effectively resolved without exposing taxpayers to the risk
of loss. In June 2016, the FSB published guidance on resolution planning for
systemically important insurers, and two consultations on resolution and resolution
planning for central counterparties, in August 2016 and February 2017.
In August 2016, the FSB published guidance on temporary funding and on the
operational continuity of banks in resolution and, in October 2016, it published a
methodology to assess the implementation of the FSB’s Key Attributes of Effective
Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions in the banking sector. In December
2016, a consultative paper was issued on possible arrangements to support the
continued access to financial market infrastructures (FMIs) by firms in resolution.

152

BIS 87th Annual Report

More intense supervisory oversight
Following the 2015 publication of the FSB peer review on supervisory frameworks
and approaches for domestic systemically important banks, work on supervisory
effectiveness has been taken forward by various BCBS working groups and initiatives.
The IAIS has also worked on supervisory effectiveness for G-SIIs, and more broadly
for internationally active insurance groups, through its ComFrame project.

Making OTC derivatives markets safer
Improvements to over-the-counter derivatives markets were a key pillar of the G20
reforms. Trade reporting of OTC derivatives; central clearing and, where appropriate,
exchange or electronic platform trading of standardised OTC derivatives; and higher
capital and minimum margin requirements for non-centrally cleared derivatives
were designed to mitigate systemic risk, increase transparency and reduce market
abuse.
In August 2016, the FSB published a progress report on reforms to these
markets, noting that, while reforms continued to be implemented, there were
significant delays in implementing margin requirements for non-cleared derivatives,
and platform trading frameworks were relatively undeveloped.
The FSB also published a report in the same month assessing member
jurisdictions’ plans to address legal barriers to reporting and accessing OTC
derivatives transaction data. The report set out the steps jurisdictions are committed
to taking to address these barriers, given the importance of trade reporting for the
identification of risks in the OTC derivatives markets.
The FSB continued to support the harmonisation of key data elements
necessary to support OTC derivatives data aggregation, notably the unique
transaction identifier (UTI), unique product identifier (UPI) and Legal Entity Identifier
(LEI). The FSB’s working group to address UTI and UPI governance, formed in April
2016, is engaging with stakeholders ahead of finalising its recommendations.

Transforming shadow banking into resilient market-based finance
In November 2016, the FSB announced it would assess progress in transforming
shadow banking into resilient market-based finance and would aim to complete
this exercise in time for the G20 Leaders’ Summit in Hamburg in July 2017. This
work will review shadow banking activities since the global financial crisis and
related financial stability risks, and whether the policies and monitoring put in place
by FSB members are adequate to address these risks.
In January 2017, the FSB published recommendations to address structural
vulnerabilities from asset management activities that could potentially present
financial stability risks. This followed a consultation in June 2016 that set out
potential financial stability risks and measures to address them.

Measures to reduce misconduct risk
Ethical conduct, and compliance with both the letter and spirit of applicable laws
and regulations, are critical to public trust and confidence in the financial system.
Misconduct is relevant to prudential oversight, as it can potentially affect the safety
and soundness of individual financial institutions and ultimately the financial
system. Following significant examples of misconduct by banks, in May 2015 the
FSB launched a misconduct workplan that seeks to (i) examine whether reforms to
incentives, for instance to governance and compensation structures, are having a

BIS 87th Annual Report

153

sufficient effect on reducing misconduct; (ii) improve global standards of conduct
in the fixed income, commodities and currency markets; and (iii) reform major
financial benchmarks. The FSB published a progress report on the implementation
of its recommendations to reform major interest rate benchmarks in July 2016. In
September, it also published a progress report on its misconduct workplan,
including a section that considered the effectiveness of compensation tools in
addressing misconduct risks.

Addressing the decline in correspondent banking
A reduction in the number of correspondent banking relationships is a source of
concern because it may affect the ability to send and receive international
payments, or it could drive some payment flows underground, with potential
consequences for economic growth, financial inclusion and the stability and
integrity of the financial system. The FSB has a four-point action plan to assess and
address the causes of this decline. As part of this work, and collaborating closely
with other international organisations, the FSB undertook a data collection exercise
covering over 300 banks in some 50 jurisdictions to assess the issues. The FSB
progress reports were published in August and December 2016.

Lessons from international experience on macroprudential policies
The IMF, FSB and BIS published a report in August 2016 to take stock of the lessons
learned from national and international experience on the development and
implementation of macroprudential policies.

Addressing data gaps
The global financial crisis highlighted significant information gaps that the
authorities faced in the lead-up to the crisis, making it more difficult to identify
emerging risks. As a result, the Data Gaps Initiative (DGI) was created in 2009 and is
now in its second phase. The first progress report of this second phase was
published in September 2016. Additionally, the FSB and the IAIS organised a
thematic workshop to explore data gaps in systemic risk in the insurance sector in
March 2017.

Advancing transparency through the Legal Entity Identifier
The FSB continued to provide secretariat support to the LEI Regulatory Oversight
Committee. The global LEI System expanded its coverage, with nearly half a million
LEIs issued since its establishment. It also prepared for the collection of ownership
data on direct and ultimate parents of legal entities, which will be implemented
during 2017 to support data aggregation at the level of corporate groups.

Strengthening accounting standards
Effective accounting and audit standards are essential for maintaining financial
stability. In July 2016, the FSB encouraged work being undertaken by auditors to
enhance the quality of the audits of SIFIs. The FSB also received updates on progress
by accounting standard setters in finalising the accounting standards on expected
loan loss provisions.

154

BIS 87th Annual Report

Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD)
In December 2015, the FSB established the TCFD to develop a set of voluntary,
consistent disclosure recommendations for use by companies in providing
information to investors, lenders and insurers about climate-related financial risks.
In April 2016, the TCFD published its phase 1 report setting out its initial work and,
in December 2016, published draft recommendations for public consultation. The
TCFD’s final recommended disclosures will be sent to the G20 Leaders’ Summit in
July 2017.

Assessing risks from fintech
The FSB workplan on assessing possible financial stability risks from fintech includes
stocktakes of innovation facilitators developed by authorities, fintech credit
intermediation, and issues for authorities in the use of distributed ledger
technology. In November 2016, the FSB agreed a workplan, cooperating with other
international organisations, to identify the supervisory and regulatory financial
stability issues faced by the growth in fintech. The FSB will publish a report on its
work ahead of the G20 Leaders’ Summit in July 2017.

Monitoring implementation and evaluating the effects of reforms
The FSB, working with standard-setting bodies, has started to assess how far the
post-crisis regulatory reforms have achieved their intended policy outcomes. The
FSB published its second annual implementation and effects report in August 2016.
The FSB also undertook a number of peer reviews over this period. In May
2016, the FSB published a peer review evaluating the progress made by FSB
member jurisdictions in implementing its policy framework for strengthening
oversight and regulation of shadow banking. The review concluded that
implementation of the framework remains at a relatively early stage and that more
work is needed to enable jurisdictions to comprehensively assess and respond to
potential shadow banking risks posed by non-bank financial entities. Additionally,
the FSB published the country peer reviews of India and Japan in August and
December 2016, respectively. The FSB also launched a thematic peer review on
corporate governance as well as country peer reviews of Argentina, Brazil, France,
Hong Kong SAR, Korea and Singapore.
For the July 2017 G20 Leaders’ Summit, the FSB has developed a comprehensive
workplan on the effects of reforms. It includes the development of a framework for
post-implementation evaluation of the effects of the G20 financial regulatory
reforms; work for the third annual implementation and effects report that will be
published ahead of the Summit; a call for evidence from members on the effects of
reforms; and two workshops – one with market participants and one with academics
– to share experience in analysing the effects of reforms and evidence to date.

International Association of Deposit Insurers
The International Association of Deposit Insurers (IADI) is the global standardsetting body for deposit insurance systems. IADI contributes to the stability of
financial systems by advancing standards and guidance for effective deposit
insurance systems and promoting international cooperation among deposit
insurers, bank resolution authorities and other safety-net organisations.

BIS 87th Annual Report

155

The number of organisations affiliated with IADI stands at 107, comprising
83 deposit insurers as members, 10 central banks and bank supervisors as
associates, and 14 institutional partners. Thus, almost 70% of all jurisdictions with
explicit deposit insurance systems are represented within IADI’s membership. The
President and Chair of IADI’s Executive Council is Thomas M Hoenig, Vice President
of the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

Strategic goals
IADI’s strategic goals focus on three key objectives: promoting compliance with the
IADI Core Principles for Effective Deposit Insurance Systems; advancing deposit
insurance research and policy development; and providing IADI members with
technical support to modernise and upgrade their systems. IADI’s Core Principles
are incorporated in the FSB’s Key Standards for Sound Financial Systems, and are
used in the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) reviews conducted by the
IMF and the World Bank.
In support of its strategic goals, IADI completed a review of its governance
structure and funding arrangements in May 2016. As a result, IADI’s seven Standing
Committees have been replaced by four newly established Council Committees
(CCs), each carrying out an oversight and advisory role for the Association. Three of
the CCs (Core Principles and Research; Member Relations; and Training and
Technical Assistance) focus on one or more of the strategic goals, while the fourth
(Audit and Risk) exercises an internal control function.

International conferences and events
Crisis prevention and management, together with the role of deposit insurers in
crises, was the focus of IADI’s 15th Annual Conference, held in October 2016 in
Seoul, Korea.
In December 2016, IADI and the FSI held their seventh annual joint conference
on bank resolution, crisis management and deposit insurance issues. The conference
took place in Basel, bringing together more than 200 delegates from financial
safety-net organisations in 75 jurisdictions.
IADI’s Fourth Biennial Research Conference, to be held in June 2017 at the
BIS in Basel, will provide a forum for researchers and safety net practitioners to
advance their knowledge on a wide range of contemporary issues facing deposit
insurers.
IADI also hosted global and regional seminars in a wide variety of locations, on
topics identified in IADI member survey results, including deposit protection and
mobile money, enhancing asset recovery, depositor reimbursement, and legal
frameworks.
IADI: www.iadi.org

International Association of Insurance Supervisors
The International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) is the global standardsetting body for the insurance sector. Its mission is to promote effective and
globally consistent insurance supervision and contribute to global financial stability
so that policyholders benefit from fair, safe and stable insurance markets. The
Executive Committee is chaired by Victoria Saporta, Executive Director of Prudential
Policy at the Bank of England.

156

BIS 87th Annual Report

ComFrame
In 2011, the IAIS began a multi-year initiative to design a common framework, or
ComFrame, for the supervision of internationally active insurance groups. In June
2016, the IAIS approved a plan to restructure ComFrame and integrate it directly
into the IAIS-developed Insurance Core Principles (ICPs). In March 2017, it released
for public consultation the first set of ComFrame material integrated with relevant
ICPs (covering governance, supervisory measures, supervisory cooperation, and
coordination and resolution). The IAIS is due to adopt ComFrame in late 2019, after
which it will be available for implementation by members.

Global insurance capital standards
As part of ComFrame, the IAIS is developing the global risk-based insurance capital
standard (ICS). In May 2016, the IAIS launched the second field-testing exercise
designed to provide an evidence-based approach to ICS development. Forty-one
volunteer insurance groups representing approximately 30% of global insurance
premium volume participated. The field-testing exercise incorporated confidential
reporting on the previously developed Basic Capital Requirement and Higher Loss
Absorbency policy measure. In July 2016, the IAIS published its second ICS
consultation paper, generating more than 2,000 pages of feedback from 75
organisations. The IAIS is using this feedback and lessons from field-testing to
develop ICS Version 1.0 for extended field-testing, which will be published in July
2017.

Global systemically important insurers
Global systemically important insurers (G-SIIs) are insurance entities whose distress
or disorderly failure would cause significant disruption to the global financial
system and economic activity. As part of its scheduled three-year review cycle, the
IAIS published the Updated G-SII Assessment Methodology in June 2016. The IAIS
applied this updated methodology in making recommendations to the Financial
Stability Board (FSB) as part of the FSB’s annual G-SII identification process.
In July 2013, the IAIS published a framework of G-SII policy measures, including
a classification table of typical insurance products and activities. After finding that
the notion of non-traditional non-insurance activities and products required further
clarification, the IAIS replaced this with a more granular and nuanced assessment of
product features in a paper published in June 2016.

Implementation
The Self-Assessment and Peer Review process is a key component of the IAIS
implementation programme. In 2016, 90 jurisdictions participated in IAIS
assessments, with an average of 73 jurisdictions participating in each one.
Assessments were completed on ICP 3 (Information Sharing and Confidentiality
Requirements) and ICP 25 (Supervisory Cooperation and Coordination), as well as
ICP 13 (Reinsurance and Other Forms of Risk Transfer) and ICP 24 (Macroprudential
Surveillance and Insurance Supervision). Assessment results help identify areas for
potential revision of supervisory material and provide critical inputs into the
implementation efforts of the IAIS and its partners.
The IAIS collaborates with the FSI on insurance seminars and an online training
seminar for insurance supervision professionals known as FIRST-ONE, consisting of
webinars and tutorials. This web-based programme is delivered over a four-month

BIS 87th Annual Report

157

period through live webinars and self-directed FSI Connect modules. In 2016, 215
supervisors from more than 50 authorities participated.
To continue to enhance the capacity of insurance supervisors, the IAIS made
further revisions to the Core Curriculum – a comprehensive learning and resource
tool for supervisors. The IAIS also continued its engagement with the Access to
Insurance Initiative to advance capacity-building for insurance supervisors in
support of inclusive insurance markets.
The IAIS Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding, a global framework for
cooperation and information exchange, continued to gain new signatories, with six
more jurisdictions joining it. This brings the total number of signatories to 63
jurisdictions accounting for nearly 71% of worldwide premium volume.

International accounting and auditing
The IAIS submitted comments on the following International Auditing and
Assurance Standards Board papers: “Enhancing audit quality in the public interest”,
“Strategic objectives & work plan for 2017–18”, and “Exploring the growing use of
technology in audit, with a focus on data analytics”.

Insurance Core Principles
Insurance Core Principles developed by the IAIS provide a globally accepted
regulatory and supervisory framework for the insurance sector. In March 2017, the
IAIS released the following revised ICPs for public consultation: ICP 3, ICP 9
(Supervisory Review and Reporting), ICP 10 (Preventive Measures, Corrective
Measures and Sanctions), ICP 12 (Exit from the Market and Resolution) and ICP 25.

Macroprudential policy and surveillance framework
In January 2017, the IAIS released its 2016 Global Insurance Market Report
covering the global insurance sector from a supervisory perspective with a focus
on sector performance and key risks. A key component of the IAIS macroprudential
policy and surveillance framework, the report shows that the (re)insurance sector
has remained well functioning and stable, while operating in an increasingly
difficult macroeconomic and financial environment characterised by weak global
demand, low inflation rates, very low interest rates, and bursts of financial market
volatility.

Supporting materials
In August 2016, the IAIS published an Issues paper on cyber risk to the insurance
sector and, in November 2016, an Application paper on approaches to supervising
the conduct of intermediaries.

Economic analysis, research and statistics
The BIS’s economic analysis and research on monetary and financial stability policy
issues are conducted within its Monetary and Economic Department (MED).
Economists are located at the head office in Basel and at the BIS Representative
Offices in Hong Kong SAR and Mexico City. The BIS also compiles and disseminates

158

BIS 87th Annual Report

international statistics on financial institutions and markets. Through its economic
analysis, research and statistics, the BIS helps to meet the needs of monetary and
supervisory authorities for policy insight and data.

Analysis and research
Analysis and research at the BIS are the basis of its background notes for bimonthly
and other meetings of central bank officials, analytical support for the Basel-based
Committees, and the Bank’s own publications. Research seeks to strike a balance
between responsiveness to short-term issues and proactivity in exploring themes
that are of strategic importance for central banks and prudential authorities.
Collaborative efforts with central bank and academic researchers around the
world stimulate broad dialogue on key policy questions. As part of its efforts to
strengthen research collaboration with senior professionals from academia and
research institutions, the BIS in 2016 appointed Markus Brunnermeier, the Edwards
S Sanford Professor of Economics at Princeton University, as the BIS’s first Alexandre
Lamfalussy Senior Research Fellow. This fellowship complements the visiting fellows
programme for academic researchers and the Central Bank Research Fellowship
(CBRF) Programme.
The BIS also organises conferences and workshops to bring together participants
from policy, research and business. The flagship event for central bank Governors is
the BIS Annual Conference. In June 2016, the 15th BIS Annual Conference focused
on long-term issues for central banks, including financial structure and growth, and
inequality and globalisation. Moreover, the semiannual meetings of the BIS Research
Network provide an opportunity to discuss current macroeconomic and financial
topics.
Most of the BIS’s analysis and research activities are undertaken at its Basel
headquarters, but an important part of the effort is carried out at its two
representative offices. Both offices have developed research programmes as well as
active secondment and exchange schemes to collaborate with member central
banks in their respective regions. The Representative Offices also oversee a
programme of conferences and collaborative research networks.
Regular reports of the research activities of the Asian Office are presented to
the Asian Consultative Council (ACC), comprising the Governors of the 12 BIS
member central banks in the Asia-Pacific region.4 Research activities in the Americas
Office are organised in cooperation with the Consultative Council for the Americas
(CCA), a group of eight central banks in the Americas,5 most notably the annual
research conference and research networks, under the direction of a Scientific
Committee of CCA central bank research heads. In May 2016, the Central Reserve
Bank of Peru hosted the seventh BIS CCA Annual Research Conference on “Inflation
dynamics: the role of labour markets, productivity and globalisation”.
As part of its broader effort to strengthen research, last year BIS Management
commissioned an external review of BIS research, which was presented to the Board
in January 2017. The review’s independent perspective on BIS research is a key
input into the strategy to further enhance the quality and usefulness of BIS research
and policy analysis for central banks. In March 2017, the BIS Board endorsed an
action plan prepared by BIS Management which sets out the course of action for
reinforcing BIS research over the coming years. The plan identifies areas for

improvement in the three main stages of the research process: planning, execution
and dissemination.
Most BIS research is published in BIS Working Papers, the BIS Quarterly Review
and BIS Papers, in both print and online versions. It also informs the discussion of
policy challenges outlined in the Annual Report. BIS economists present their
research at international conferences and publish in professional journals and other
external publications.
BIS research: www.bis.org/forum/research.htm

Research topics
Reflecting the Bank’s mission, BIS research centres on monetary and financial
stability. The main areas of research are currently changes in financial intermediation;
new frameworks for monetary and financial stability policy; and the global economy
and spillovers. Within these broad areas, research projects span a broad range of
topics and analytical angles.
The research on financial intermediation aims at understanding the behaviour
of financial institutions and their interaction with financial markets. Analysing the
way different intermediaries operate and markets function is an important
foundation for this work. The perspectives gained help policymakers evaluate
changes in the financial system, monitor financial vulnerabilities, and inform the
design of financial stability and monetary policies.
In the past year, work in this area included research on the impact of regulatory
changes on the behaviour of banks; determinants of cash holdings by asset
managers; the risk-taking channel of the exchange rate; the drivers of low longterm interest rates; and the determinants and implications of recent pricing
anomalies in global financial markets.
Research on post-crisis monetary and financial stability policy frameworks aims
to strengthen the analytical foundations of central bank policy. The gap between
the theory and practice of central bank policy remains large as central banks
continue to operate in uncharted territory, and the role of financial stability
considerations in monetary policy remains the subject of intense debate.
During the past year, specific projects in this area studied the impact of
commodity price cycles on credit growth and resource allocation; the relationship
between household debt and private consumption; and how the characteristics of
credit booms and busts affect cost-benefit assessments of monetary policies that
lean against the build-up of financial imbalances.
Research on the global economy and spillovers focuses on the implications of
the tight real and financial integration of the global economy for monetary and
financial stability. Understanding these linkages is of particular importance for
policymakers in an environment where the benefits of globalisation are under
increased scrutiny.
One focus of research in this area during the year was the evolution of global
value chains and their impact on inflation dynamics. Others included cross-border
effects of macroprudential policies, and the global role of the US dollar as a funding
currency. The BIS international banking statistics provide key information for these
studies.
Research at the Asian Office is carried out under staggered two-year
programmes. In 2016, the Office completed one on “Financial systems and the real
economy”. It also started the 2016–17 programme on “The price, real and financial
effects of exchange rates”, which covers topics such as the effect of currency
movements on output and inflation and the risk-taking channel of exchange rates.

160

BIS 87th Annual Report

For the 2017–18 programme, the chosen theme is “Fixed income markets in Asia
and the Pacific: structure, participation and pricing”, which will cover topics such as
the international role of Asia-Pacific fixed income assets, the price and liquidity
dynamics in these markets, the interaction between bond and foreign exchange
market volatility, and the implications for monetary and financial stability policy of
global interest rate shocks.
In the Americas, the research network on “The commodity cycle: macroeconomic
and financial stability implications” culminated in a conference hosted by the
Americas Office in Mexico City in August 2016. A new research network on exchange
rates, with a focus on exchange rate pass-through analysis using disaggregated
data, started in early 2017. A working group analysed the effectiveness of
macroprudential policies using credit registry data. Using the same type of data, a
new initiative is studying the impact of the changes of funding on bank business
models and monetary policy transmission.

International statistical initiatives
The BIS’s unique set of international banking and financial statistics underpins the
Basel Process by supporting the analysis of global financial stability. This involves
close cooperation with other financial international organisations, especially
through the BIS’s participation in the Inter-Agency Group on Economic and
Financial Statistics (IAG).6 This is the international body tasked with coordinating
and monitoring the implementation of the recommendations to address the data
gaps revealed by the financial crisis, in accord with the FSB and IMF proposals to
the G20. Following the completion of the initiative’s first phase in 2015, a second
five-year phase is now under way with the aim of implementing the regular
collection and dissemination of comparable, timely, integrated, high-quality and
standardised statistics for policy use.
To close the data gaps related to international banking activities, the BIS has
continued to expand its key international banking statistics (IBS) data set, reported
by central banks under the guidance of the CGFS. In the past year, this expansion
included the publication of additional detail in the locational banking statistics,
shedding further light on the geography of international banking, specifically the
claims and liabilities of banks in each reporting country on counterparties in more
than 200 countries. In parallel, data reported for banks located in China and Russia
were published for the first time. The BIS has been also working with all reporting
countries to address remaining data gaps, to review options for improving the
consistency between the consolidated IBS and supervisory data, and to support
efforts to make data more widely available.
In addition to banking statistics, the BIS publishes a variety of other statistics
on its website, including property prices, debt securities, debt service ratios, credit
to the private and public sectors, global liquidity, effective exchange rates, foreign
exchange markets, derivatives and payment systems. Last year, new time series on
credit-to-GDP gaps and commercial property price indicators as well as historical
time series on consumer prices were added to this offering. The BIS also started to
publish daily data on nominal effective exchange rates.
These data appear in the BIS Statistical Bulletin, published concurrently with
the BIS Quarterly Review and accompanied by explanatory charts illustrating the
6

The IAG comprises the BIS, the ECB, Eurostat, the IMF, the OECD, the United Nations and the World
Bank Group (www.principalglobalindicators.org). These organisations also sponsor the Statistical
Data and Metadata eXchange (SDMX), whose standards the BIS uses for its collection, processing
and dissemination of statistics (www.sdmx.org).

latest developments. They are also available in the BIS Statistics Warehouse, an
interactive search tool for customised queries, and the BIS Statistics Explorer, a
simpler search tool that allows for pre-defined views of the most current data.
The BIS’s statistical work also focuses on long-term financial stability indicators
to support its own research agenda as well as the initiatives of the Basel Process
and the G20. It relies extensively on the BIS Data Bank, which contains, in particular,
key economic indicators shared among BIS member central banks.
Finally, the BIS hosts the International Data Hub, where information about
systemically important financial institutions is stored and analysed on behalf of a
limited number of participating supervisory authorities. The analysis supports
participating supervisors in their engagement with reporting firms and enriches the
dialogue between supervisors across jurisdictions. The first phase of this FSB-led
initiative, covering firms’ credit exposures, was completed in 2013. The second
phase involved the gathering of data covering these institutions’ funding
dependencies, and was completed in 2015. The third phase, to be implemented in
2017–18, involves the collection of additional information about reporting
institutions’ consolidated balance sheets, and greater information-sharing with
international financial institutions that hold a financial stability mandate.

Other areas of international cooperation
The BIS participates in international forums such as the G20 and collaborates with
key international financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and
the World Bank Group. The BIS also contributes to the activities of central banks
and regional central bank organisations by participating in their events as well as
occasionally hosting joint events. During the past year, it co-organised events or
collaborated with the following regional organisations on the topics outlined
below:
•
CEMLA (Center for Latin American Monetary Studies) – banking regulation and
supervision;
•
EMEAP (Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks) – monetary and
financial stability, financial markets, banking regulation and supervision;
•
MEFMI (Macroeconomic and Financial Management Institute of Eastern and
Southern Africa) – reserves management, bank regulation and supervision,
payment and settlement systems; and
•
SEACEN (South East Asian Central Banks) Research and Training Centre –
banking regulation and supervision, payment and settlement systems, central
bank governance, monetary policy.

Financial services
Through its Banking Department, the BIS offers a wide range of financial services
designed to support the reserves management activities of central banks and other
official monetary authorities, and to foster international cooperation in this area.
Some 140 institutions, as well as a number of international organisations, make use
of these services.
Safety and liquidity are the key features of BIS credit intermediation, which is
supported by rigorous internal risk management. Independent control units reporting
directly to the BIS Deputy General Manager monitor and control the related risks.
A compliance unit monitors compliance risk, while financial risks – ie credit, market

162

BIS 87th Annual Report

and liquidity risks – and operational risk are overseen by a risk management unit that
is also responsible for ensuring an integrated approach to risk management.
BIS financial services are provided from two linked trading rooms: one in Basel,
at the Bank’s head office; and one in Hong Kong SAR, at its Representative Office
for Asia and the Pacific.

Scope of services
As an institution owned and governed by central banks, the BIS is well placed to
understand the needs of reserves managers – their primary focus on safety and
liquidity as well as the evolving need to diversify their exposures. To meet those
needs, the BIS offers investments that vary by currency, maturity and liquidity. In
addition, the Bank provides short-term liquidity facilities and extends credit to
central banks, usually on a collateralised basis. Moreover, the Bank can act as
trustee and collateral agent in connection with international financial operations.
Tradable instruments are available in maturities ranging from one week to five
years, in the form of Fixed-Rate Investments at the BIS (FIXBIS), Medium-Term
Instruments (MTIs) and products with embedded optionality (Callable MTIs). These
instruments can be bought or sold throughout the Bank’s dealing hours. Also
offered are money market placements, such as sight/notice accounts and fixedterm deposits.
On 31 March 2017, total deposits stood at SDR 204 billion, of which about 95%
were denominated in currencies and the remainder in gold (see graph).
The Bank transacts foreign exchange and gold on behalf of its customers,
thereby providing access to a large liquidity base in the context of their rebalancing
of reserve portfolios. The Bank’s foreign exchange services encompass spot
transactions in major currencies and Special Drawing Rights (SDR), as well as swaps,
outright forwards, options and dual currency deposits (DCDs). In addition, the Bank
provides gold services that include buying and selling, sight accounts, fixed-term
deposits, earmarked accounts, quality upgrading, refining and location exchanges.
The BIS provides asset management products in the form of (i) dedicated
portfolio management mandates tailored to each customer’s preferences; or (ii) BIS
Investment Pools (BISIPs), which are open-end fund structures that allow customers

to invest in a common pool of assets. The BISIP structure is also used for the Asian
Bond Fund (ABF) initiative sponsored by EMEAP to foster the development of local
currency bond markets. Also based on this structure are the following initiatives
developed with a group of advising central banks: the BISIP ILF1 (a US inflationprotected government securities fund); the BISIP CNY (a domestic Chinese
sovereign fixed income fund); and the BISIP KRW (a domestic Korean sovereign
fixed income fund).
The BIS Banking Department hosts global and regional meetings, as well as
seminars and workshops on reserves management issues. These gatherings facilitate
the exchange of knowledge and experience among reserves managers and promote
the development of investment and risk management capabilities in central banks
and international organisations. The Department also occasionally supports central
banks in reviewing and assessing their reserves management practices.

Representative Offices
The BIS has a Representative Office for Asia and the Pacific (the Asian Office),
located in Hong Kong SAR, and a Representative Office for the Americas (the
Americas Office), located in Mexico City. The Representative Offices promote
cooperation and foster the exchange of information and data within each region
by supporting regional institutions and Basel-based committees, and conducting
research. The offices also organise outreach meetings.

The Asian Office
The Asian Consultative Committee (ACC) guides the activities of the Asian Office.
The Chair of the ACC is currently Graeme Wheeler, Governor of the Reserve Bank of
New Zealand. In addition to supporting cooperative activities and conducting
research, the Asian Office provides banking services to the region’s monetary
authorities. It is also through the office in Hong Kong that the Financial Stability
Institute delivers a programme of meetings and seminars in the region that are
closely tailored to local priorities.
As well as the research activities mentioned above, the Asian Office organised
eight high-level BIS meetings during the year. Most of these were organised jointly
with a central bank or a regional central banking organisation, especially the
Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP) and the South East
Asian Central Banks (SEACEN). These meetings included the Working Party on
Monetary Policy in Asia, held in Sydney in May 2016; the Research Conference on
Financial Inclusion and Central Banks, jointly organised in Cebu by the BIS and
Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas in June; the workshop in Hong Kong in August for the
research programme on exchange rate effects; a conference in Kuala Lumpur in
October that presented the results of the Office’s research programme on “Financial
systems and the real economy”; the SEACEN-BIS High-level Seminar held in Manila
in September; the 11th Meeting on Monetary Policy Operating Procedures, held in
Hong Kong in November; and two meetings of the EMEAP-BIS Forum on Financial
Markets, one in Auckland in June and the other in Beijing in December.

The Americas Office
The cooperative activities of the Office are conducted under the guidance of the
Consultative Council for the Americas (CCA). The CCA is currently chaired by Stephen
S Poloz, Governor of the Bank of Canada. The CCA met four times in the year under
review. The CCA also convened its third Roundtable with chief executive officers of
large financial institutions, which was held in October 2016 in Washington DC,
hosted by the Bank of Canada.
Cooperative activities beyond research are also organised under two functional
groups. The Consultative Group of Directors of Operations (CGDO) holds regular
teleconferences to exchange views on financial market developments and central
bank operations. A CGDO study group produced a report on foreign exchange
liquidity in the Americas. The Consultative Group of Directors of Financial Stability
(CGDFS), which focuses on financial stability issues, held its annual meeting in Viña
del Mar in September 2016, hosted by the Central Bank of Chile.
As for outreach activities, the Americas Office co-organised with the Center for
Latin American Monetary Studies (CEMLA) a roundtable in Santo Domingo on
inflation measurement, expectations and monetary policy. Jointly with the InterAmerican Development Bank (IDB), a workshop on macroprudential policy was
organised in Buenos Aires in November 2016, hosted by the Central Bank of
Argentina. Finally, two sessions were sponsored and organised at the Annual
Meeting of the Latin American and Caribbean Economic Association (LACEA) in
Medellín, Colombia.
BIS Americas Office: www.bis.org/about/repoffice_americas.htm

Governance and management of the BIS
The governance and management of the Bank are conducted at three principal
levels: the General Meeting of BIS member central banks; the BIS Board of Directors;
and BIS Management.

The General Meeting of BIS member central banks
Sixty central banks and monetary authorities are currently members of the BIS and
have rights of voting and representation at General Meetings. The Annual General
Meeting (AGM) is held no later than four months after 31 March, the end of the BIS
financial year. The AGM approves the annual report and the accounts of the Bank,
decides on the distribution of a dividend and elects the Bank’s auditor.

BIS 87th Annual Report

The BIS Board of Directors
The Board is responsible for determining the strategic and policy direction of the
BIS, supervising Management and fulfilling the specific tasks given to it by the
Bank’s Statutes. The Board meets at least six times a year.
Pursuant to Article 27 of the BIS Statutes, the Board may have up to 21
members, including six ex officio Directors comprising the central bank Governors
of Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States. Each
ex officio member may appoint another member of the same nationality. Nine
Governors of other member central banks may be elected to the Board.7 The Board
elects a Chairman from among its members for a three-year term and may elect a
Vice-Chairman. The present Chairman is Jens Weidmann, President of the Deutsche
Bundesbank.

Changes to Article 27 of the BIS Statutes regarding Board composition
At its meeting on 12 September 2016, the BIS Board of Directors decided to summon an Extraordinary General
Meeting (EGM) on 7 November 2016 to adopt, among other changes, the following amendments to Article 27 of
the Bank’s Statutes:
•
The total number of Directors would be reduced from 21 to 18 to further enhance the functioning of the
Board.
•
The number of Directors to be appointed by the six ex officio Directors (Article 27(2)) would be reduced from
six to one. It was agreed that the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York would be appointed.
•
The number of elected Directors would be raised accordingly from nine to 11.
With the reduction of the number of appointed Directors from six to one, the representation of European and
non-European regions would become more balanced. This change, together with the increase in the number of
elected Directors, would also allow for more flexibility in the Board’s composition.
On 7 November 2016, the EGM of BIS shareholders adopted the changes to Article 27 (and to Articles 28 and 29).
Article 27 is one of the few articles whose change requires approval by the “Signatory Governments to the
Convention respecting the BIS of 20 January 1930”, ie the governments of Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the
United Kingdom and Switzerland. These governments were therefore approached after the EGM and, by letter
dated 3 May 2017, the Swiss government notified the BIS that the new Article 27 had been finally approved by all
these six governments.
At its meeting on 8 May 2017, the BIS Board of Directors further decided that the new Article 27 would come
into effect on 1 January 2019, by when the running terms of the Directors who were appointed under Article 27(2)
will have expired.

  Changes to Articles 28 and 29 of the BIS Statutes are more of a technical nature. The change to Article 28 related to the
possibility of electing a new Director for a full term of three years instead of just for the remainder of the predecessor’s term.
Article 29 was deleted (the desirability for Directors to reside in Europe had become obsolete).

Four advisory committees, established pursuant to Article 43 of the Bank’s
Statutes, assist the Board in its work:
•
The Administrative Committee reviews key areas of the Bank’s administration,
such as budget and expenditures, human resources policies and information
technology. The Committee meets at least four times a year. Its Chairman is
Haruhiko Kuroda.
•
The Audit Committee meets with internal and external auditors, as well as with
the Compliance unit. Among its duties is the examination of matters related to

7

In addition, one member of the Economic Consultative Committee (see page 138) serves as an
observer to BIS Board meetings on a rotating basis.

•

the Bank’s internal control systems and financial reporting. The Committee
meets at least four times a year and is chaired by Stephen S Poloz.
The Banking and Risk Management Committee reviews and assesses the Bank’s
financial objectives, the business model for BIS banking operations and the risk
management frameworks of the BIS. The Committee meets at least once a year.
Its Chairman is Stefan Ingves.
The Nomination Committee deals with the appointment of members of the BIS
Executive Committee and meets on an ad hoc basis. It is chaired by the Board’s
Chairman, Jens Weidmann.

In memoriam
It was with great sadness that the Bank learned of the deaths of:
•
Luc Coene on 5 January 2017 at the age of 69. A former Governor of the
National Bank of Belgium (2011–15), Mr Coene was a BIS Director from April
2011 to March 2015. He was again appointed to the BIS Board from January
2016. He chaired the BIS Audit Committee from 2013 to 2015.
•
Hans Tietmeyer on 27 December 2016 at the age of 85. Mr Tietmeyer was
President of the Deutsche Bundesbank (1993–99) and served as a BIS Director
from October 1993 until December 2010. He chaired the BIS Consultative
Committee and its successor, the BIS Administrative Committee (2003–10), and
also the BIS Audit Committee (2003–07). He was the Bank’s Vice-Chairman
from 2003 to 2010.
•
Carlo Azeglio Ciampi on 16 September 2016 at the age of 95. Mr Ciampi was
Governor of the Bank of Italy (1979–93) and served as a BIS Director from
November 1979 to April 1993. He again served as a BIS Director from July 1994
to May 1996, when he was also the Bank’s Vice-Chairman.

Compliance
The Board of Directors and Management attach the highest importance to
compliance. The Bank’s compliance charter, adopted by the Board in 2005 and
available on the Bank’s website, calls for the activities of the institution and its staff
to be conducted in accordance with the highest ethical standards and all applicable
laws and regulations, as well as internal rules, policies and procedures. The Chief
Compliance Officer leads an independent compliance function and assists
Management in identifying and assessing compliance issues and in guiding and
educating staff on related matters. The Chief Compliance Officer reports to the
Deputy General Manager and has direct access to the Audit Committee.

BIS budget policy
Management prepares the annual BIS expenditure budget by establishing an
overall business plan consistent with the strategic direction and financial framework
agreed with the BIS Board of Directors. Within that context, business areas specify
their detailed plans and resource requirements. The process of reconciling detailed
business plans, objectives and overall resources culminates in a draft budget, which
must be approved by the Board. The budget distinguishes between administrative
and capital expenditures.
The Bank’s administrative expense in 2016/17 was CHF 275.4 million.9 Of this,
Management and staff expense, including remuneration, pensions, and health
and accident insurance accounted for around 71%. New staff positions were
added during the year in accordance with the Bank’s business plan, which
emphasised mainly economic research and the Basel Process as well the
management of cyber-security risk. A further 27% of BIS administrative expense
related to “office and other expense”, including information technology, buildings
and equipment, and general operational costs.
Capital expenditure can vary significantly from year to year, depending on
projects in progress. For 2016/17, capital expenditure amounted to CHF 25.2 million,
of which 60% related to IT investment and 40% to buildings and equipment.

BIS remuneration policy
At the end of the 2016/17 financial year, the BIS employed 633 staff members10
from 61 countries. The jobs performed by staff members are classified into job
grades associated with a structure of salary ranges. The salaries of individual staff
members move within the ranges of the structure on the basis of performance.
Every three years, a comprehensive survey benchmarks BIS salaries against
compensation in comparable institutions and market segments, with adjustments

9

The Bank’s budget includes the costs of its post-employment benefit arrangements on a cash basis.
The operating expense in the Bank’s annual financial statements includes these costs in accordance
with IAS 19. The IAS 19 expense for the next financial year depends on the actuarial valuations as
at 31 March each year, which are only finalised in April after the budget has been discussed by the
Board. As such, any additional IAS 19 charges are treated outside the scope of the budget. Total
administrative expense in 2016/17 comprised administrative expense within the budget of
CHF 291.0 million plus additional IAS 19 charges of CHF 83.1 million.

10

This corresponds to 610.3 full-time equivalent positions. At the end of the 2015/16 financial year,
the Bank employed 632 staff members, corresponding to 602.1 full-time equivalent positions.
Including positions related to hosted organisations and not funded by the Bank, the number of
staff was 683 in 2015/16 and 689 in 2016/17.

BIS 87th Annual Report

taking place as of 1 July in the following year. In benchmarking, the Bank focuses
on the upper half of market compensation in order to attract highly qualified staff.
The analysis takes into account the differing rates of taxation on compensation at
the surveyed institutions.
In years between comprehensive salary surveys, the salary structure is adjusted
as of 1 July on the basis of Switzerland’s inflation rate and the weighted average
real wage development in advanced countries. As of 1 July 2016, this adjustment
produced an increase of 0.28% in the salary structure.
The salaries of senior officials are also regularly benchmarked against
compensation in comparable institutions and market segments. As of 1 July 2016,
the annual remuneration of senior officials, before expatriation allowances, is based
on the salary structure of CHF 732,260 for the General Manager;11 CHF 619,600 for
the Deputy General Manager; and CHF 563,270 for Heads of Department.
BIS staff members have access to a contributory health insurance plan and a
contributory defined benefit pension plan. At the Bank’s headquarters, non-Swiss
staff members recruited from abroad, including senior officials, are entitled to an
expatriation allowance as well as an education allowance for their children, subject
to certain conditions.
The Annual General Meeting approves the remuneration of members of the
Board of Directors, with adjustments taking place at regular intervals. The total
fixed annual remuneration paid to the Board of Directors was CHF 1,147,128 as of
1 April 2017. In addition, Board members receive an attendance fee for each Board
meeting in which they participate. Assuming that the full Board is represented in all
Board meetings, the annual total of these attendance fees amounts to CHF 1,068,240.

Financial activities and results
The Bank’s balance sheet
The Bank’s balance sheet increased by SDR 10.9 billion over the year, following an
increase of SDR 14.5 billion in 2015/16. The balance sheet total on 31 March 2017
was SDR 242.2 billion.
Deposits, primarily from central banks, constitute the largest share of the Bank’s
liabilities. About 95% of the deposits are denominated in currencies, with the
remainder in gold. On 31 March 2017, total deposits amounted to SDR 204.4 billion,
compared with SDR 189.0 billion at the end of March 2016.
Currency deposits at 31 March 2017 stood at SDR 194.4 billion, which was
SDR 15.7 billion higher than at the previous year-end. The currency composition of
deposits remained stable, with deposits in US dollars at 76%, in euros at 11% and in
sterling at 6%. Gold deposits stood at SDR 9.9 billion on 31 March 2017, a decrease
of SDR 0.3 billion over the financial year.
Funds received from deposit liabilities are invested in assets that are managed
conservatively. At 31 March 2017, 39% of total assets comprised government and
other securities or treasury bills. Sight account balances (mainly at central banks)
were 20%, and reverse repurchase agreements (primarily with sovereign bonds as
collateral) were 18%, while gold and gold loans made up a further 11%. The gold
balance included 103 tonnes in the Bank’s own investment portfolio.

11

In addition to the basic salary, the General Manager receives an annual representation allowance and
enhanced pension rights.

Financial performance
The net profit for 2016/17 was SDR 828 million, which was SDR 415 million higher
than in 2015/16, due to three main factors.
First, the net interest and valuation income (SDR 1,034 million) was
SDR 508 million higher than in the previous year due to an increase in the net
interest on the currency banking portfolios, which reflected three developments:
(a) average currency deposits were SDR 20 billion higher in 2016/17 than in the
previous year. The higher volume contributed additional profit; (b) the
intermediation profit earned during the year was higher than in the previous year,
primarily because of higher earnings during periods of wide FX swap spreads; and
(c) the spreads to Libor on government and other securities in the currency banking
portfolios tightened during the year, producing a valuation gain, by comparison
with valuation losses in 2015/16, when the spreads to Libor widened.
Second, the net gain on sales of available for sale securities (SDR 49 million)
was SDR 30 million lower than in the previous year. These gains arise when
portfolios are rebalanced to their benchmarks. Gains were lower in 2016/17
primarily because of the effects of the increase in the US dollar yield curve.
Third, the net gain on sales of gold investment assets (SDR 23 million) was
SDR 61 million lower than in the previous year. This reflected the sale of 1 tonne,
compared with the 4 tonnes sold in 2015/16.
The Bank’s total comprehensive income also includes three valuation changes
which are reflected directly in equity. First, the net movement on revaluation of
available for sale securities (SDR –164 million) arose from revaluation losses due to an
increase in SDR yield curves (in particular, the US dollar), along with the realisation
of SDR 49 million of gains in profit. This compares with a gain of SDR 17 million
when interest rates declined in the previous year. Second, the net movement on the
revaluation of gold investment assets (SDR 111 million) reflected a 4.6 % rise in the
gold price, partly offset by the realisation of SDR 23 million of gains into profit. This
compares with a valuation loss of SDR 36 million in the previous year, when the
gold price rose less (by only 1.9%) and more gold was sold (and hence more gains
were realised). The final valuation change relates to the actuarial re-measurement
of the Bank’s post-employment defined benefit obligations. This resulted in a gain
of SDR 64 million, mostly due to an increase in the value of pension fund assets.
This compares with a loss of SDR 162 million the previous year, when the value of
pension fund assets fell and the IAS 19 discount rate was reduced. The total
comprehensive income for 2016/17 was SDR 839 million (2015/16: SDR 231 million).

Allocation and distribution of profit
Proposed dividend
The dividend policy of the Bank considers the Bank’s capital adequacy and leverage
ratio requirements. The policy incorporates a normal sustainable dividend, which
increases by SDR 10 per share per annum, and a supplementary dividend, which is
decided ex post, while keeping leverage and economic capital within the desired
range. Consistent with the BIS’s dividend policy, it is proposed to declare a normal
dividend of SDR 225 per share for the financial year 2016/17 and a supplementary
dividend of SDR 75 per share. The dividend is payable on 558,125 shares, and will
result in a total payment of SDR 167.4 million.

172

BIS 87th Annual Report

Proposed allocation of net profit for 2016/17
In accordance with Article 51 of the BIS Statutes, the Board of Directors recommends
that the General Meeting allocate the 2016/17 net profit of SDR 827.6 million in the
following manner:
(a) SDR 167.4 million to be paid as a dividend of SDR 300 per share;
(b) SDR 33.0 million to be transferred to the general reserve fund; and
(c) SDR 627.2 million, representing the remainder of the available profit, to be
transferred to the free reserve fund.

BIS 87th Annual Report

Introduction
The Bank for International Settlements (BIS, “the Bank”) is an
international financial institution which was established
pursuant to the Hague Agreements of 20 January 1930 as well
as the Bank’s Constituent Charter and its Statutes.
The headquarters of the Bank are at Centralbahnplatz 2,
4002 Basel, Switzerland. The Bank maintains representative
offices in Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region of the
People’s Republic of China (for Asia and the Pacific), and in
Mexico City, Mexico (for the Americas).
The objectives of the BIS, as laid down in Article 3 of its Statutes,
are to promote cooperation among central banks, to provide
additional facilities for international financial operations and to
act as trustee or agent for international financial settlements. In
the course of its activities, the Bank accepts deposits from
customers, which it then invests. The Bank also invests its own
equity.
Sixty central banks are currently members of the Bank. The
governance and management of the BIS are discussed in “The
BIS: mission, activities, governance and financial results” in this
Annual Report

Accounting policies

All figures in these financial statements are presented in SDR
millions unless otherwise stated. Amounts are subject to
rounding and consequently there may be small differences
both within and between disclosures.

2. Functional and presentation currency
The functional and presentation currency of the Bank is the
Special Drawing Right (SDR) as defined by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF).
The composition of the SDR is subject to periodic review.
Following such a review by the IMF during 2015, changes were
be made to the SDR basket effective from 1 October 2016.
As currently calculated, one SDR is equivalent to the sum of
USD 0.58252, EUR 0.38671, Renminbi 1.0174, JPY 11.9 and
GBP 0.085946.
Monetary assets and liabilities are translated into SDR at the
exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Other assets
and liabilities and profits and losses are translated into SDR
at the exchange rates ruling at the date of the transaction.
Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of monetary
assets and liabilities and from the settlement of transactions are
included as net foreign exchange gains or losses in the profit
and loss account.

The accounting policies set out below have been applied to
both of the financial years presented unless otherwise stated.

3. Presentation of interest

1. Scope of the financial statements
These financial statements recognise all assets and liabilities that
are controlled by the Bank and in respect of which the economic
benefits, as well as any rights and obligations, lie with the Bank.
As part of its activities, the Bank undertakes financial transactions
in its own name but for the economic benefit of other parties.
These include transactions on a custodial or agency basis, such
as those undertaken on behalf of investment entities operated
by the Bank and on behalf of the staff pension fund, which do
not have separate legal personality from the Bank. Unless otherwise
stated, such transactions are not included in these financial
statements.
The preparation of the financial statements requires the Bank’s
Management to make assumptions and use estimates to arrive
at reported amounts. In doing so, Management exercises
judgment based on reliable information. Actual results could
differ significantly from these estimates.
The notes to the financial statements containing areas of
estimation uncertainty considered to require critical judgment
and which have the most significant effect on the amounts
recognised in the financial statements are: note 12, “Postemployment obligations”; note 28, “Fair value hierarchy”; and
note 31, “Contingent liabilities”.

BIS 87th Annual Report

In the profit and loss account, interest income includes
“negative” interest on liabilities while interest expense includes
“negative” interest on assets. Interest on derivatives is presented
as interest income. Notes to the financial statements separately
analyse components of interest income and interest expense.

4. Classification of financial instruments
Upon initial recognition, the Bank classifies each financial
instrument into one of the following categories:

•
•

Loans and receivables

•
•

Available for sale financial assets

Financial assets and financial liabilities held at fair value
through profit and loss
Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost

The classification to these categories is dependent on the nature
of the financial instrument and the purpose for which it was
entered into, as described in Section 5 below.

185

The resulting classification of each financial instrument determines
the accounting methodology that is applied, as described in
the accounting policies below. Where the financial instrument
is classified as held at fair value through profit and loss, the
Bank does not subsequently change this classification.

5. Asset and liability structure
Assets and liabilities are organised into two sets of portfolios:

7. Notice accounts
Notice accounts are short-term monetary assets, including
balances at futures clearing brokers. These typically have notice
periods of three days or less, and are included under the
balance sheet heading “Loans and advances”. They are
considered cash equivalents for the purposes of the statement
of cash flows.
These financial instruments are classified as loans and
receivables because they are not quoted in an active market,
and because they comprise fixed or determinable payments.
They are included in the balance sheet at their principal value
plus accrued interest. Interest is included under ”Interest income”
or “Interest expense” (negative interest) on an accruals basis.

A. Banking portfolios
These comprise currency and gold deposit liabilities and related
banking assets and derivatives.
The Bank operates a banking business in currency and gold on
behalf of its customers. In this business, the Bank is exposed to
credit and market risks. The extent of these exposures is limited
by the Bank’s risk management approach.
The Bank classifies all currency financial instruments in its
banking portfolios (other than cash and sight and notice
accounts with banks, and sight and notice deposit account
liabilities) as held at fair value through profit and loss. The use
of fair values in the currency banking portfolios is described in
Section 9 below.
All gold financial assets in these portfolios are treated as loans
and receivables, and all gold financial liabilities are treated as
financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.

8. Sight and notice deposit account liabilities
Sight and notice deposit accounts are short-term monetary
liabilities. They typically have notice periods of three days or
less and are included under the balance sheet heading
“Currency deposits”.
These financial instruments are classified as financial liabilities
measured at amortised cost because they are not quoted in an
active market and include fixed or determinable payments.
They are included in the balance sheet at their principal value
plus accrued interest. Interest is included in interest expense on
an accruals basis.

B. Investment portfolios
These comprise assets, liabilities and derivatives relating
principally to the investment of the Bank’s equity.
The Bank holds most of its equity in financial instruments
denominated in the constituent currencies of the SDR, which
are managed by comparison with a fixed duration benchmark
of bonds.
Currency assets in investment portfolios, with the exception of
cash and sight accounts and notice accounts (Sections 6 and 7
below), are classified as available for sale.
The remainder of the Bank’s equity is held in gold. The Bank’s
own gold holdings are treated as available for sale.

6. Cash and sight accounts
Cash and sight accounts are included in the balance sheet at
their principal value plus accrued interest where applicable.

186

9. Use of fair values in the currency banking
portfolios
In operating its currency banking business, the Bank acts as a
market-maker in certain of its currency deposit liabilities. As a
result of this activity, the Bank incurs realised profits and losses
on these liabilities.
In accordance with the Bank’s risk management policies, the
market risk inherent in this activity is managed on an overall
fair value basis, combining all the relevant assets, liabilities and
derivatives in its currency banking portfolios. The realised and
unrealised profits or losses on currency deposit liabilities are
thus largely offset by realised and unrealised losses or profits
on the related currency banking assets and derivatives, or on
other currency deposit liabilities.
To reduce the accounting inconsistency that would otherwise
arise from recognising realised and unrealised gains and losses
on different bases, the Bank classifies the relevant assets,
liabilities and derivatives in its currency banking portfolios as
held at fair value through profit and loss.

BIS 87th Annual Report

10. Securities purchased under resale
agreements
Securities purchased under resale agreements (“reverse
repurchase agreements”) are recognised as collateralised loan
transactions by which the Bank lends cash and receives an
irrevocable commitment from the counterparty to return the
cash, plus interest, at a specified date in the future. As part of
these agreements, the Bank receives collateral in the form of
securities to which it has full legal title, but must return
equivalent securities to the counterparty at the end of the
agreement, subject to the counterparty’s repayment of the
cash. As the Bank does not acquire the risks or rewards
associated with ownership of these collateral securities, they are
not recognised as assets in the Bank’s balance sheet.
The collateralised loans relating to securities purchased under
resale agreements are currency assets. The accounting
treatment is determined by whether the transaction involves
currency assets held at fair value through profit and loss
(Section 11 below) or currency investment assets available for
sale (Section 13 below).

11. Currency assets classified at fair value
through profit and loss

After initial measurement, the currency deposit liabilities are
revalued to fair value, with all realised and unrealised movements
in fair value included under “Net valuation movement”.

13. Currency investment assets available for sale
Currency assets include treasury bills, securities purchased
under resale agreements, loans and advances, and government
and other securities.
The Bank’s currency investment assets are classified as available
for sale investments and are initially included in the balance
sheet on a trade date basis. The accrual of interest and
amortisation of premiums paid and discounts received are
included in the profit and loss account under “Interest income”
on an effective interest rate basis.
After trade date, the currency investment assets are revalued to
fair value, with unrealised movements included in the securities
revaluation account, which is reported under the balance sheet
heading “Other equity accounts”. The movement in fair value is
included in the statement of comprehensive income under the
heading “Net movement on revaluation of available for sale
securities”. Realised profits on disposal are included in the profit
and loss account under “Net gain on sales of available for sale
securities”.

Currency assets include treasury bills, securities purchased
under resale agreements, loans and advances, and government
and other securities.
As described in Section 9 above, the Bank classifies all of the
relevant assets in its currency banking portfolios as held at fair
value through profit and loss. These currency assets are initially
included in the balance sheet on a trade date basis. The accrual
of interest and amortisation of premiums paid and discounts
received are included in the profit and loss account under
“Interest income” or “Interest expense” (negative interest) on an
effective interest rate basis. After initial measurement, the
currency assets are revalued to fair value, with all realised and
unrealised movements in fair value included under “Net valuation
movement”.

14. Gold and gold loans
Gold comprises gold bar assets held in custody at central banks
and sight accounts denominated in gold. Gold is considered by
the Bank to be a financial instrument.
Gold is included in the balance sheet at its weight in gold
(translated at the gold market price and USD exchange rate
into SDR). Purchases and sales of gold are accounted for on a
settlement date basis. Forward purchases or sales of gold are
treated as derivatives prior to the settlement date.
The treatment of realised and unrealised gains or losses on
gold is described in Section 15 below.

12. Currency deposit liabilities classified at fair
value through profit and loss
All currency deposit liabilities, with the exception of sight and
notice deposit account liabilities, are classified as held at fair
value through profit and loss.

Gold loans comprise fixed-term gold loans. Gold loans are
included in the balance sheet on a trade date basis at their
weight in gold (translated at the gold market price and USD
exchange rate into SDR) plus accrued interest.
Accrued interest on gold loans is included in the profit and loss
account under “Interest income” on an effective interest rate
basis.

These currency deposit liabilities are initially included in the
balance sheet on a trade date basis. The accrual of interest to
be paid and amortisation of premiums received and discounts
paid are included under the profit and loss account heading
“Interest expense” or “Interest income” (negative interest) on an
effective interest rate basis.

BIS 87th Annual Report

187

15. Realised and unrealised gains or losses on
gold
The treatment of realised and unrealised gains or losses on
gold depends on the accounting treatment as described below:

Allocated (or “earmarked”) gold deposits provide depositors
with a claim for delivery of the specific gold bars deposited by
the customer with the Bank on a custody basis. Beneficial
ownership and risk remain with the customer. As such, allocated
gold deposit liabilities and the related gold bar assets are not
included on the Bank’s balance sheet. They are disclosed as offbalance sheet items (see note 26, “Off-balance sheet items”).

A. Banking portfolios, comprising gold deposits and
related gold banking assets
Gold derivatives included in the portfolios are held at fair value
through profit and loss. Gains or losses on derivative transactions
in gold are included in the profit and loss account under “Net
foreign exchange movement” as net transaction gains or losses.
Gains or losses on the retranslation of the net position in gold
in the banking portfolios are included under “Net foreign
exchange movement” as net translation gains or losses.

B. Investment portfolios, comprising gold investment
assets
The Bank’s own holdings of gold are accounted for as available
for sale assets.
Unrealised gains or losses on the Bank’s gold investment assets
over their deemed cost are taken to the gold revaluation
account in equity, which is reported under the balance sheet
heading “Other equity accounts”. The movement in fair value is
included in the statement of comprehensive income under the
heading “Net movement on revaluation of gold investment
assets”.
For gold investment assets held on 31 March 2003 (when the
Bank changed its functional and presentation currency from the
gold franc to the SDR), the deemed cost is approximately
SDR 151 per ounce, based on the value of USD 208 per ounce
that was applied from 1979 to 2003 following a decision by the
Bank’s Board of Directors, translated at the 31 March 2003
exchange rate.
Realised gains or losses on disposal of gold investment assets
are included in the profit and loss account as “Net gain on sales
of gold investment assets”.

16. Gold deposits
Gold deposits comprise unallocated sight and fixed-term
deposits of gold from central banks.
Unallocated gold deposits provide customers with a general
claim on the Bank for delivery of gold of the same weight and
quality as that delivered by the customer to the Bank, but do
not provide the right to specific gold bars. Unallocated gold
deposits are included in the balance sheet on a trade date basis
at their weight in gold (translated at the gold market price and
USD exchange rate into SDR) plus accrued interest. Accrued
interest on gold deposits is included in the profit and loss
account under “Interest expense” on an effective interest rate
basis.

188

17. Securities sold under repurchase agreements
Securities sold under repurchase agreements (“repurchase
agreements”) are recognised as collateralised deposit transactions
by which the Bank receives cash and provides an irrevocable
commitment to return the cash, plus interest, at a specified
date in the future. As part of these agreements, the Bank
transfers legal title of collateral securities to the counterparty.
At the end of the contract, the counterparty must return
equivalent securities to the Bank, subject to the Bank’s repayment
of the cash. As the Bank retains the risks and rewards associated
with ownership of these securities, they continue to be recognised
as assets in the Bank’s balance sheet.
Where the repurchase agreement is associated with currency
assets available for sale, the collateralised deposit transaction is
accounted for as a financial liability measured at amortised cost.
Where the repurchase agreement is associated with the
management of currency assets held at fair value through profit
and loss, the collateralised deposit transaction is classified as a
financial instrument held at fair value through profit and loss.
The collateralised deposits relating to securities sold under
repurchase agreements are initially included in the balance
sheet on a trade date basis. The accrual of interest is included
in the profit and loss account under “Interest expense” or
“Interest income” (negative interest) on an effective interest
rate basis. After initial measurement, the transactions classified
as held at fair value through profit and loss are revalued to fair
value with all unrealised movements in fair value included
under “Net valuation movement.”

18. Securities lending
The Bank participates in securities lending transactions in which
it lends debt securities in exchange for a fee. The transactions
are conducted under standard agreements employed by
financial market participants. The securities which have been
transferred are not de-recognised from the balance sheet since
the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred, even if
the borrower has the right to sell or re-pledge the securities.
Such Bank-owned securities transferred to a borrower are
presented on the balance sheet as part of “Government and
other securities” and “Treasury bills”. Note 3 provides further
details.

BIS 87th Annual Report

19. Derivatives

21. Impairment of financial assets

Derivatives are used either to manage the Bank’s market risk or
for trading purposes. They are accounted for as financial
instruments held at fair value through profit and loss.

Financial assets, other than those held at fair value through
profit and loss, are assessed for indications of impairment at
each balance sheet date. A financial asset is impaired when
there is objective evidence that the estimated future cash flows
of the asset have been reduced as a result of one or more
events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset.
Evidence of impairment could include significant financial
difficulty, default, or probable bankruptcy / financial reorganisation
of the counterparty or issuer.

Derivatives are initially included in the balance sheet on a trade
date basis. Where applicable, the accrual of interest and
amortisation of premiums and discounts are included in the
profit and loss account under “Interest income” on an effective
interest rate basis.
After trade date, derivatives are revalued to fair value, with all
realised and unrealised movements in value included under
“Net valuation movement”.
Derivatives are included as either assets or liabilities, depending
on whether the contract has a positive or a negative fair value
for the Bank.
Where a derivative contract is embedded within a host contract
which is not accounted for as held at fair value through profit
and loss, it is separated from the host contract for accounting
purposes and treated as though it were a standalone derivative
as described above.

Impairment losses are recognised to the extent that a decline in
fair value below amortised cost is considered significant or
prolonged. Impairment of currency assets is included in the
profit and loss account under “Net valuation movement”, with
impairment of gold loans included under “Interest income”. If
the amount of the impairment loss decreases in a subsequent
period, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed
through profit and loss to the extent that the carrying amount
of the investment does not exceed that which it would have
been had the impairment not been recognised.

22. Accounts receivable and accounts payable

20. Valuation policy
The Bank’s classification of each financial instrument determines
those instruments’ valuation basis and accounting treatment.
The majority of the financial instruments on the balance sheet
are included at fair value. The Bank defines fair value as the exit
price of an orderly transaction between market participants on
the measurement date.
The Bank considers published price quotations in active markets
as the best evidence of fair value. Where no published price
quotations exist, the Bank determines fair values using a valuation
technique appropriate to the particular financial instrument.
Such valuation techniques may involve using market prices of
recent arm’s length market transactions in similar instruments
or may make use of financial models. Where financial models
are used, the Bank aims at making maximum use of observable
market inputs as appropriate, and relies as little as possible on
its own estimates. Such valuation models comprise discounted
cash flow analyses and option pricing models.
The Bank values its positions at their exit price, so that assets
are valued at the bid price and liabilities at the offer price.
Derivative financial instruments are valued on a bid-offer basis,
with valuation reserves, where necessary, included in derivative
financial liabilities. Financial assets and liabilities that are not
valued at fair value are included in the balance sheet at
amortised cost.

BIS 87th Annual Report

Accounts receivable and accounts payable are principally very
short-term amounts relating to the settlement of financial
transactions. They are recognised on a trade date basis and
subsequently accounted for at amortised cost until their
settlement.

23. Land, buildings and equipment
The cost of the Bank’s buildings and equipment is capitalised
and depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated
useful lives of the assets concerned, as follows:

•
•
•
•

Buildings – 50 years
Building installations and machinery – 15 years
Information technology equipment – up to 4 years
Other equipment – 4 to 10 years

The Bank’s land is not depreciated. The Bank undertakes an
annual review of impairment of land, buildings and equipment.
Where the carrying amount of an asset is greater than its
estimated recoverable amount, the asset is written down to the
lower value.

189

24. Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Bank has a present legal or
constructive obligation as a result of events arising before the
balance sheet date and it is probable that economic resources
will be required to settle the obligation, provided that a reliable
estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Best
estimates and assumptions are used when determining the
amount to be recognised as a provision.

25. Taxation
The Bank’s special legal status in Switzerland is set out
principally in its Headquarters Agreement with the Swiss
Federal Council. Under the terms of this document, the Bank is
exempted from virtually all direct and indirect taxes at both
federal and local government level in Switzerland.
Similar agreements exist with the government of the People’s
Republic of China for the Asian Office in Hong Kong SAR and
with the Mexican government for the Americas Office.
However, income and gains received by the Bank may be
subject to tax imposed in the country of origin. Such income
and gains are recognised on a gross basis, with the corresponding
tax recognised as an expense.

26. Post-employment benefit obligations
The Bank operates three post-employment benefit arrangements,
respectively, for staff pensions, Directors’ pensions, and health
and accident insurance for current and former staff members.
An independent actuarial valuation is performed annually for
each arrangement.

The amount charged to the profit and loss account represents
the sum of the current service cost of the benefits accruing for
the year under the scheme, and interest at the discount rate on
the net of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of
the fund assets. Past service costs from plan amendments are
immediately recognised through profit or loss. Gains and losses
arising from re-measurement of the obligations, such as
experience adjustments (where the actual outcome is different
from the actuarial assumptions previously made) and changes
in actuarial assumptions are charged to other comprehensive
income in the year in which the re-measurement is applied.
They are not subsequently included in profit and loss in future
years.

B. Directors’ pensions and post-employment health
and accident benefits
The liability, defined benefit obligation, amount charged to the
profit and loss account, and gains and losses arising from
re-measurement in respect of the Bank’s other post-employment
benefit arrangements are calculated on a similar basis to that
used for the staff pension fund.

27. Statement of cash flows
The Bank’s statement of cash flows is prepared using an indirect
method. It is based on the movements in the Bank’s balance
sheet, adjusted for changes in financial transactions awaiting
settlement.
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and sight and notice
accounts with banks, which are very short-term financial assets
that typically have notice periods of three days or less.

A. Staff pensions
The liability in respect of the staff pension fund is based on the
present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair
value of the fund assets, both at the balance sheet date. The
defined benefit obligation is calculated using the projected unit
credit method. The present value of the defined benefit
obligation is determined from the estimated future cash
outflows. The rate used to discount the cash flows is determined
by the Bank based on the market yield of highly rated corporate
debt securities in Swiss francs which have a duration
approximating that of the related liability.

3. Currency assets
Currency assets comprise the following products:
Treasury bills are short-term debt securities issued by governments on a discount basis.
Securities purchased under resale agreements (“reverse repurchase agreements”) are recognised as collateralised loan transactions. Interest
receivable on the transaction is fixed at the start of the agreement. During the term of the agreement, the Bank monitors the fair value of
the loan and related collateral securities, and may call for additional collateral (or be required to return collateral) based on movements in
market value.
Loans and advances comprise fixed-term loans to commercial banks, advances and notice accounts. Advances relate to committed and
uncommitted standby facilities which the Bank provides for its customers. Notice accounts are very short-term financial assets, typically
having a notice period of three days or less.
Government and other securities are debt securities issued by governments, international institutions, other public sector institutions,
commercial banks and corporates. They include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, fixed and floating rate bonds, covered bonds and
asset-backed securities.

BIS 87th Annual Report

4. Derivative financial instruments
The main types of derivative instruments used by the Bank for economic hedging and trading purposes are as follows:
Currency and gold options are contractual agreements under which the seller grants the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to either
buy (call option) or sell (put option), by or on a set date, a specific amount of a currency or gold at a predetermined price. In consideration,
the seller receives a premium from the purchaser.
Currency and gold swaps, cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps are contractual agreements to exchange cash flows related to
currencies, gold or interest rates (for example, fixed rate for floating rate). Cross-currency interest rate swaps involve the exchange of cash
flows related to a combination of interest rates and foreign exchange rates. Except for certain currency and gold swaps and cross-currency
interest rate swaps, no exchange of principal takes place.
Currency and gold forwards are contractual agreements involving the exchange of foreign currencies or gold at a future date. This includes
undelivered spot transactions.
Forward rate agreements are interest rate forward contracts that result in cash settlement at a future date for the difference between a
contracted rate of interest and the prevailing market rate.
Futures contracts include bond and interest rate futures, which represent contractual agreements to receive or pay a net amount based on
changes in bond prices or interest rates at a future date. Futures contracts are settled daily with the exchange. Associated margin payments
are settled by cash or marketable securities.
Swaptions are contractual agreements under which the seller grants the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to enter into a currency
or interest rate swap at a predetermined price by or on a set date. In consideration, the seller receives a premium from the purchaser.
The Bank recognises all derivatives transacted in its name, including those for which the economic benefit lies with a third party. In such
circumstances, the Bank recognises both the original derivative contract and an exactly offsetting derivative contract with the beneficial party.

BIS 87th Annual Report

8. Currency deposits
Currency deposits comprise the following products:
Sight and notice deposit accounts are very short-term financial liabilities, typically having a notice period of three days or less.
Medium-Term Instruments (MTIs) are fixed rate investments at the Bank issued with initial maturities of between one and 10 years.
Callable MTIs (CMTIs) are MTIs that are callable at the option of the Bank at an exercise price of par. At 31 March 2017, one CMTI had a
call date in December 2017. The other CMTIs at 31 March 2017 and all CMTIs at 2016 had options which had expired by the reporting date.
The balance sheet total for CMTIs includes the fair value of the embedded interest rate option.
FIXBIS are fixed rate investments at the Bank for any maturities between one week and one year.
FRIBIS are floating rate investments at the Bank with maturities of one year or longer for which the interest rate is reset in line with prevailing
market conditions.
Fixed-term deposits are fixed rate investments at the Bank, typically with an initial maturity of less than one year.
Dual Currency Deposits (DCDs) are fixed-term deposits that are repayable on the maturity date either in the original currency or at a fixed
amount in a different currency at the option of the Bank. The balance sheet total for DCDs includes the fair value of the embedded foreign
exchange option. These deposits all mature between April 2017 and June 2017 (2016: in April 2016 and May 2016).
The Bank acts as the sole market-maker in certain of its currency deposit liabilities and has undertaken to repay some of these financial
instruments at fair value, in whole or in part, at one to two business days’ notice.
The amount the Bank is contractually obliged to pay at maturity in respect of its total currency deposits, including interest accrued to
31 March 2017, is SDR 194,499.0 million (2016: SDR 178,433.9 million).
Sight and notice deposit accounts are included on an amortised cost basis, while all other deposits are included at their fair value.

12. Post-employment benefit obligations
The Bank operates three post-employment arrangements:
1. A defined benefit pension arrangement for its staff in the event of retirement, disability or death. Under this arrangement, benefits accrue
according to years of participation and pensionable remuneration. These benefits are paid out of a fund, without separate legal personality.
Contributions are made to this fund by the Bank and by staff. The fund is the beneficial owner of assets on which it receives a return. These
assets are administered by the Bank for the sole benefit of participants in the arrangement. Except as shown in this note and as described
in note 4, “Derivative financial instruments”, these assets are not recognised as assets of the Bank. The Bank remains ultimately liable for all
benefits due under the arrangement.
2. An unfunded defined benefit arrangement for its Directors, whose entitlement is based on a minimum service period of 49 months.
3. An unfunded post-employment health and accident benefit arrangement for its staff and their dependants. Employees who leave the
Bank after becoming eligible for early retirement benefits from the pension arrangement are eligible for post-employment health and
accident benefits.
All three arrangements operate in Swiss francs and are valued annually by an independent actuary. During 2017/18, the Bank expects to
make contributions of SDR 33.7 million to its post-employment arrangements.

I. Sensitivity analysis of significant actuarial assumptions
The Bank is exposed to risks from these obligations and arrangements including investment risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk,
longevity risk and salary risk.
Investment risk is the risk that plan assets will not generate returns at the expected level.
Interest rate risk is the exposure of the post-employment benefit obligations to adverse movements in interest rates, including credit
spreads. A decrease in interest rates will increase the present value of these obligations. However, in the case of the staff pension arrangement
this may be offset, either fully or partly, by an increase in value of the interest bearing securities held by the fund.
Foreign exchange risk is the exposure of the post-employment benefit obligations to adverse movements in exchange rates between the
Swiss franc, which is the operating currency of the post-employment benefit arrangements, and the SDR, which is the functional currency
of the Bank.
Longevity risk is the risk that actual outcomes differ from actuarial estimates of life expectancy.
Salary risk is the risk that higher than expected salary rises increase the cost of providing a salary-related pension.

14. Statutory reserves
The Bank’s Statutes provide for application of the Bank’s annual net profit, by the Annual General Meeting at the proposal of the Board of
Directors, to three specific reserve funds: the legal reserve fund, the general reserve fund and the special dividend reserve fund; the
remainder of the net profit after payment of any dividend is generally allocated to the free reserve fund.
Legal reserve fund. This fund is currently fully funded at 10% of the Bank’s paid-up capital.
General reserve fund. After payment of any dividend, 5% of the remainder of the Bank’s annual net profit currently must be allocated to the
general reserve fund.
Special dividend reserve fund. A portion of the remainder of the annual net profit may be allocated to the special dividend reserve fund,
which shall be available, in case of need, for paying the whole or any part of a declared dividend. Dividends are normally paid out of the
Bank’s net profit.
Free reserve fund. After the above allocations have been made, any remaining unallocated net profit is generally transferred to the free
reserve fund.
Receipts from the subscription of the Bank’s shares are allocated to the legal reserve fund as necessary to keep it fully funded, with the
remainder being credited to the general reserve fund.
The free reserve fund, general reserve fund and legal reserve fund are available, in that order, to meet any losses incurred by the Bank. In
the event of liquidation of the Bank, the balances of the reserve funds (after the discharge of the liabilities of the Bank and the costs of
liquidation) would be divided among the Bank’s shareholders.
The table below analyses the movements in the Bank’s statutory reserves over the last two years:

The average number of full-time equivalent employees during the financial year ended 31 March 2017 was 574 (2016: 573). In addition, at
31 March 2017, the Bank was the legal employer of 75 staff members (2016: 67) working in the secretariats of the Financial Stability Board
(FSB), the International Association of Deposit Insurers (IADI) and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS).
The Bank makes direct contributions, which include salary and post-employment costs and other related expenses, towards the operational
costs of the FSB, IADI and the IAIS, and these amounts are shown under “Direct contributions to hosted organisations”. The Bank also
provides logistical, administrative and staffing-related support for these organisations, the cost of which is included within the Bank’s regular
administrative expense categories.

The Bank’s dividend policy requires that the dividend be set at a sustainable level which should vary over time in a predictable fashion. The
policy also requires that the dividend reflect the Bank’s capital needs and its prevailing financial circumstances, with a payout ratio of
between 20% and 30% in most years.
In line with the Bank’s dividend policy, it is proposed to declare a normal dividend for 2016/17 of SDR 225 per share, SDR 10 per share
higher than for the previous year. The medium-term guidance of the dividend policy allows for the possibility that a supplementary dividend
could also be paid in years where profits are high, and the Bank’s financial circumstances allow. A supplementary dividend of SDR 75 per
share is also proposed for the 2016/17 financial year. Therefore, the total proposed dividend for 2016/17 is SDR 300 per share.
The proposed dividend for 2017 represents a payout ratio of 20% of net profit (2016: 29%).

Gold bars held under earmark arrangements comprise specific gold bars which have been deposited with the Bank on a custody basis. They
are included at their weight in gold (translated at the gold market price and the USD exchange rate into SDR). At 31 March 2017, gold bars
held under earmark amounted to 397 tonnes of gold (2016: 443 tonnes).
Portfolio management mandates include BIS Investment Pools (BISIPs) and dedicated mandates.
The BISIPs are a range of open-ended investment funds created by the Bank and managed using entities that do not have a separate legal
personality from the Bank. The Bank has an agency relationship with the BISIPs, such that the assets of the BISIPs are held in the name of
the BIS, but the economic benefit lies with central bank customers. The Bank does not invest for its own account in the BISIPs.
Dedicated mandates are portfolios which are managed by the Bank in accordance with investment guidelines set by the customer. They are
held for the financial benefit of the customer.
For both the BISIPs and the dedicated mandates, the Bank is remunerated by a management fee which is included under “Net fee and
commission income” in the profit and loss account.

27. Commitments
The Bank provides a number of committed standby facilities for its customers on a collateralised or uncollateralised basis. At 31 March 2017,
SDR 2,451.4 million of the outstanding commitments were collateralised (2016: SDR 3,121.6 million) and SDR 220.9 million were
uncollateralised (2016: SDR 212.9 million). As at 31 March 2017, total outstanding commitments amounted to SDR 2,672.3 million (2016:
SDR 3,334.5 million).
The BIS is committed to supporting the operations of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), the International Association of Deposit Insurers
(IADI) and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS). In each case, the Bank has a separate agreement specifying the terms
of support and commitment. The Bank is the legal employer of FSB, IADI and IAIS staff, with the regular ongoing staff costs borne by each
association. The commitment by the BIS to IADI is subject to an annual budgetary decision of the Board. The agreement with the FSB
currently ends in January 2023. The agreement with the IAIS currently ends in 2019.

28. Fair value hierarchy
The Bank categorises its financial instrument fair value measurements using a hierarchy that reflects the observability of inputs used in
measuring that value. A valuation level is assigned according to the least observable input that is significant to the fair value measurement
in its entirety. The fair value hierarchy used by the Bank comprises the following levels:
Level 1 – Instruments valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical financial instruments.
Level 2 – Instruments valued with valuation techniques using inputs which are observable for the financial instrument either directly (ie as
a price) or indirectly (ie derived from prices for similar financial instruments). This includes observable interest rates, spreads and volatilities.
Level 3 – Instruments valued using valuation techniques where the inputs are not observable in financial markets.
At 31 March 2017, the Bank had no financial instruments categorised as level 3 (31 March 2016: nil).

A. Transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy
Of the assets categorised as level 1 at 31 March 2017, SDR 935.3 million related to assets that were categorised as level 2 at 31 March 2016. Of
the assets categorised as level 2 at 31 March 2017, SDR 1,132.1 million related to assets that had been categorised as level 1 at 31 March 2016.
The transfer of assets between levels 1 and 2 reflected specific market conditions existing at the reporting dates that affected the observability
of the market prices as defined above. No liabilities were transferred between fair value hierarchy levels.

B. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value level 3
During the financial years ended 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016, the Bank did not classify any assets or liabilities as level 3 in the fair
value hierarchy.

C. Financial instruments not measured at fair value
In accordance with its accounting policies, the Bank does not account for certain financial instruments at fair value. Using the same valuation
techniques as used for fair valued financial instruments, the Bank estimates that the fair values of these financial instruments would be
materially the same as the carrying values shown in these financial statements for both 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016. If these
instruments were included in the fair value hierarchy, the valuation of “Gold loans” and “Securities sold under repurchase agreements” would
be considered level 2. All other amortised cost financial instruments would be considered level 1.

214

BIS 87th Annual Report

D. Impact of changes in the Bank’s creditworthiness
The fair value of the Bank’s liabilities may be affected by any change in its creditworthiness. If the Bank’s creditworthiness deteriorated, the
value of its liabilities should decrease, and the change in value would be reflected as a valuation movement in the profit and loss account.
The Bank regularly assesses its creditworthiness as part of its risk management processes. The Bank’s assessment of its creditworthiness did
not indicate a change which could have had an impact on the fair value of the Bank’s liabilities during the period under review.

E. The valuation of financial assets and liabilities
Certain of the Bank’s financial assets and financial liabilities are valued using valuation techniques which require estimation of appropriate
valuation parameters. Changes in estimates of these parameters could significantly affect the reported fair values. The valuation impact of
a 1 basis point change in interest rate assumptions of key financial instruments is shown in the table below:

or senior officials of the Bank during the financial year are included in the table above as other outflows.
In addition, the Bank operates a blocked personal deposit account for certain staff members who were previously members of the Bank’s
savings fund, which closed on 1 April 2003. The terms of these blocked accounts are such that staff members cannot make further deposits
or withdrawals and the balances are paid out when they leave the Bank. The accounts bear interest at a rate determined by the Bank based
on the rate offered by the Swiss National Bank on its staff accounts plus 1%. The total balance of blocked accounts at 31 March 2017 was
SDR 10.6 million (2016: SDR 12.9 million). They are reported under the balance sheet heading “Currency deposits”.

B. Related party customers
The BIS provides banking services to its customers, which are predominantly central banks, monetary authorities and international financial
institutions. In fulfilling this role, the Bank, in the normal course of business, enters into transactions with customers which are related parties
(as defined above). These transactions include making advances, and taking currency and gold deposits. It is the Bank’s policy to enter into
transactions with related party customers on similar terms and conditions to transactions with other, non-related party customers. The
following tables show balances relating to these transactions, which are representative of the general level of business undertaken with
related party customers during the year.

Capital adequacy

1. Capital adequacy frameworks
As an international financial institution that is overseen by a Board composed of Governors of major central banks and that has no national
supervisor, the Bank is committed to maintaining its superior credit quality and financial strength, in particular in situations of financial
stress.
The Bank assesses its capital adequacy on a continuous basis throughout the year. It operates an annual capital planning process that
focuses on two elements: an economic capital framework and a financial leverage framework. The disclosures in this section relating to
credit, market, operational and liquidity risk are based on the Bank’s own assessment of capital adequacy derived in accordance with these
two BIS frameworks.
Regulatory capital ratios are not used as indicators of BIS capital adequacy because key aspects of the business model for the BIS banking
activities are not adequately captured. In the main, these relate to the high level of solvency targeted by the Bank as well as the way
regulatory capital ratios reflect portfolio concentrations and interest rate risk in the banking book.
To facilitate comparability, the Bank has implemented a framework that is consistent with the revised International Convergence of Capital
Measurement and Capital Standards (Basel II framework) issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) in June 2006.
Following that framework, the Bank discloses a Tier 1 capital ratio (Pillar 1), risk-weighted assets and more detailed related information. In
addition, the Bank calculates for reference a Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio, leverage ratio and liquidity coverage ratio taking account
of banking supervisory recommendations related to Basel III.
The Bank maintains a capital position substantially in excess of the regulatory minimum requirement in order to ensure its superior credit
quality.

2. Economic capital
The Bank’s economic capital methodology relates its risk-taking capacity to the amount of economic capital needed to absorb potential
losses arising from its exposures. The risk-taking capacity is defined as allocatable economic capital that is derived following a prudent
assessment of the components of the Bank’s equity, which are set out in the following table:

Allocatable economic capital is determined following a prudent evaluation of the Bank’s equity components for their loss absorption
capacity and sustainability. The components of capital with long-term risk-bearing capacity are the Bank’s Tier 1 capital and the sustainable
portion of the securities and gold revaluation accounts (“sustainable supplementary capital”). Only this “allocatable capital” is available for
allocation to the various categories of risk. The portion of revaluation accounts that is considered more transitory in nature is assigned to
the “capital filter” together with the profit accrued during the financial period.

Allocatable capital

As part of the annual capital planning process, Management allocates economic capital to risk categories within the amount of allocatable
capital. As a first step, capital is assigned to an “economic capital cushion” that provides an additional margin of safety and is sufficient to
sustain a potential material loss without the need to reduce the capital allocation to individual risk categories or to liquidate any holdings
of assets. The level of the economic capital cushion is determined based on stress tests that explore extreme but still plausible default events.
Allocations are then made to each category of financial risk (ie credit, market and “other risks”) as well as operational risk. “Other risks” are
risks that have been identified but that are not taken into account in the economic capital utilisation calculations, and include model risk
and residual basis risk. Reflecting the high level of solvency targeted by the Bank, the economic capital framework measures economic
capital to a 99.995% confidence level assuming a one-year horizon, except for FX settlement risk (included in the utilisation for credit risk)
and “other risks”. The amount of economic capital set aside for FX settlement risk and other risks is based on an assessment by Management.
The Bank’s economic capital framework is subject to regular review and calibration.
The following table summarises the Bank’s economic capital allocation and utilisation for credit risk, market risk, operational risk and other
risks:

3. Financial leverage
The Bank complements its capital adequacy assessment with a prudently managed financial leverage framework. The Bank monitors its
financial leverage using a ratio that compares the BIS adjusted common equity with its total exposure. However, to reflect the scope and
nature of its banking activities, the definition of the BIS adjusted common equity limits the recognition of revaluation accounts to the
proportion of the gold and securities revaluation accounts that is considered sustainable (“sustainable supplementary capital”). Further, the
exposure measure is supplemented by the inclusion of committed and uncommitted facilities, and pension fund assets.

The Bank also calculates a leverage ratio that is consistent with Basel III recommendations. The Bank’s Basel III leverage ratio differs from
the BIS leverage ratio in using Common Equity Tier 1 as its capital measure instead of BIS adjusted common equity as defined above. The
calculation of Common Equity Tier 1 capital is included in section 4B. At 31 March 2017, the Bank’s Basel III leverage ratio stood at 7.4%
(2016: 7.6%).

222

BIS 87th Annual Report

4. Capital ratios
The economic capital framework and the financial leverage framework described above are the main tools used for assessing the Bank’s
capital adequacy. Risk-weighted assets, minimum capital requirements and capital ratios are disclosed to facilitate comparability. Guidance
issued by the BCBS includes several approaches for calculating risk-weighted assets and the corresponding minimum capital requirements.
In principle, the minimum capital requirements are determined by taking 8% of the risk-weighted assets.
For credit risk, the Bank has adopted the advanced internal ratings-based approach for the majority of its exposures. Under this approach,
the risk weighting for a transaction is determined by the relevant Basel II risk weight function using the Bank’s own estimates for key inputs.
Expected loss is calculated for credit risk exposures subject to the advanced internal ratings-based approach. The expected loss is calculated
at the balance sheet date taking into account any impairment provision which is reflected in the Bank’s financial statements. The Bank had
no impaired financial assets at 31 March 2017 (2016: nil). In accordance with the requirements of the Basel frameworks, the expected loss
is compared with the impairment provision and any shortfall is deducted from the Bank’s Tier 1 capital. For securitisation exposures and
relevant other assets, the Bank has adopted the standardised approach. Under this approach, risk weightings are mapped to exposure types.
Risk-weighted assets for market risk are derived following an internal models approach. For operational risk, the advanced measurement
approach is used. Both these approaches rely on value-at-risk (VaR) methodologies.
More details on the assumptions underlying the calculations are provided in the sections on credit risk, market risk and operational risk.

Risk management

1. Risks faced by the Bank
The Bank supports its customers, predominantly central banks, monetary authorities and international financial institutions, in the
management of their reserves and related financial activities.
Banking activities form an essential element of meeting the Bank’s objectives and ensure its financial strength and independence. The BIS
engages in banking activities that are customer-related as well as activities that are related to the investment of its equity, each of which
may give rise to financial risk comprising credit risk, market risk and liquidity risk. The Bank is also exposed to operational risk.
Within the risk frameworks defined by the Board of Directors, the Management of the Bank has established risk management policies
designed to ensure that risks are identified, appropriately measured and controlled as well as monitored and reported.

2. Risk management approach and organisation
The Bank maintains superior credit quality and adopts a prudent approach to financial risk-taking, by:

•
•
•
•

maintaining an exceptionally strong capital position;

•

maintaining a high level of liquidity.

investing its assets predominantly in high credit quality financial instruments;
seeking to diversify its assets across a range of sectors;
adopting a conservative approach to its tactical market risk-taking and carefully managing market risk associated with the Bank’s strategic
positions, which include its gold holdings; and

A. Organisation
Under Article 39 of the Bank’s Statutes, the General Manager is responsible to the Board for the management of the Bank, and is assisted
by the Deputy General Manager. The Deputy General Manager is responsible for the Bank’s independent risk management and compliance
functions. The General Manager and the Deputy General Manager are supported by senior management advisory committees.
The key advisory committees are the Executive Committee, the Finance Committee and the Compliance and Operational Risk Committee.
The first two committees are chaired by the General Manager and the third by the Deputy General Manager, and all include other senior
members of the Bank’s Management. The Executive Committee advises the General Manager primarily on the Bank’s strategic planning and
the allocation of resources, as well as on decisions related to the broad financial objectives for the banking activities and strategic operational
risk management issues. The Finance Committee advises the General Manager on the financial management and policy issues related to
the banking business, including the allocation of economic capital to risk categories. The Compliance and Operational Risk Committee,
chaired by the Deputy General Manager, provides a forum for considering important compliance and operational risk matters, ensures the
coordination of compliance matters and operational risk management throughout the Bank and informs or advises the Executive Committee
as appropriate.
The risk management functions for financial risks and operational risks are performed by the Risk Management unit. The Head of Risk
Management reports to the Deputy General Manager. The Head of the Operational Risk Management unit within Risk Management has
reporting lines to the Deputy General Manager and the Head of Risk Management.
The Bank’s compliance function is performed by the Compliance unit. The objective of this function is to assist Management in ensuring
that all activities of the BIS and its staff are conducted in accordance with compliance laws, rules and standards. The Chief Compliance
Officer reports to the Deputy General Manager and also has a right of direct access to the Audit Committee on compliance matters. The
Audit Committee is an advisory committee to the Board of Directors.
The Finance unit and the Legal Service complement the Bank’s risk management. The Finance unit operates a valuation control function,
produces the Bank’s financial statements and controls the Bank’s expenditure by setting and monitoring the annual budget. The objective
of the valuation control function is to ensure that the Bank’s valuations comply with its valuation policy and procedures. The Finance unit
reports to the Deputy General Manager and the Secretary General.

226

BIS 87th Annual Report

The Legal Service provides legal advice and support covering a wide range of issues relating to the Bank’s activities. The Legal Service
reports to the General Manager.
The Internal Audit function evaluates and improves the effectiveness of risk management, control, and governance systems and processes.
Internal Audit provides an independent, objective assurance function, and advises on best practice. Internal Audit has reporting lines to the
General Manager and the Deputy General Manager, and to the Audit Committee.

B. Risk monitoring and reporting
The Bank’s financial and operational risk profile, position and performance are monitored on an ongoing basis by the relevant units.
Financial risk and compliance reports aimed at various management levels are provided regularly to enable Management to adequately
assess the Bank’s risk profile and financial condition.
Management reports financial and risk information to the Board of Directors on a monthly and a quarterly basis. Furthermore, the Audit
Committee receives regular reports from Internal Audit, and the Compliance, Finance and Operational Risk Management units. The Banking
and Risk Management Committee, another advisory committee to the Board, receives regular reports from the Risk Management unit. The
preparation of reports is subject to comprehensive policies and procedures, thus ensuring strong controls.

C. Risk methodologies
The Bank revalues virtually all of its financial instruments to fair value on a daily basis and reviews its valuations monthly, taking into account
necessary adjustments for impairment. It uses a comprehensive range of quantitative methodologies for valuing financial instruments and
for measuring risk to its net profit and equity. The Bank reassesses its quantitative methodologies in the light of its changing risk environment
and evolving best practice.
The Bank’s model validation policy defines the roles and responsibilities and processes related to the implementation of new or materially
changed risk and valuation models.
A key methodology used by the Bank to measure and manage risk is the calculation of economic capital based on value-at-risk (VaR)
techniques. VaR expresses the statistical estimate of the maximum potential loss on the current positions of the Bank measured to a
specified level of confidence and a specified time horizon. VaR models depend on statistical assumptions and the quality of available market
data and, while forward-looking, they extrapolate from past events. VaR models may underestimate potential losses if changes in risk factors
fail to align with the distribution assumptions. VaR figures do not provide any information on losses that may occur beyond the assumed
confidence level.
The Bank’s economic capital framework covers credit risk, market risk, operational risk and other risks. As part of the annual capital planning
process, the Bank allocates economic capital to the above risk categories commensurate with principles set by the Board and taking account
of the business strategy. Reflecting the high level of solvency targeted by the Bank, the economic capital framework measures economic
capital to a 99.995% confidence level assuming a one-year holding period. An additional amount of economic capital is set aside for FX
settlement risk (included in the utilisation for credit risk) and “other risks” based on Management’s assessment of risks which are not
reflected in the economic capital calculations. Moreover, capital is also allocated to an “economic capital cushion” that is based on stress
tests that explore extreme but still plausible default events. The economic capital cushion provides an additional margin of safety to sustain
a potential material loss without the need to reduce the capital allocated to individual risk categories or to liquidate any holdings of assets.
The management of the Bank’s capital adequacy is complemented by a comprehensive stress testing framework, and a prudent financial
leverage framework. The stress testing framework supplements the Bank’s risk assessment, including its VaR and economic capital calculations
for financial risk. The Bank’s key market risk factors and credit exposures are stress-tested. The stress testing includes the analysis of severe
historical and adverse hypothetical macroeconomic scenarios, as well as sensitivity tests of extreme but still plausible movements of the key
risk factors identified. The Bank also performs stress tests related to liquidity risk. The financial leverage framework focuses on a ratio that
sets the BIS adjusted common equity in relation to its total balance sheet exposure.

BIS 87th Annual Report

227

3. Credit risk
Credit risk arises because a counterparty may fail to meet its obligations in accordance with the agreed contractual terms and conditions.
A financial asset is considered past due when a counterparty fails to make a payment on the contractual due date.
The Bank manages credit risk within a framework and policies set by the Board of Directors and Management. These are complemented by
more detailed guidelines and procedures at the level of the independent risk management function.

A. Credit risk assessment
Credit risk is continuously controlled at both a counterparty and an aggregated level. The independent risk management function performs
individual counterparty credit assessments following a well defined internal rating process. As part of this process, counterparty financial
statements and market information are analysed. The rating methodologies depend on the nature of the counterparty. Based on the internal
rating and specific counterparty features, the Bank sets a series of credit limits covering individual counterparties and countries. Internal
ratings are assigned to all counterparties. In principle, the ratings and related limits are reviewed at least annually. The main assessment
criterion in these reviews is the ability of the counterparties to meet interest and principal repayment obligations in a timely manner.
Credit risk limits at the counterparty level are approved by the Bank’s Management and fit within a framework set by the Board of Directors.
On an aggregated level, credit risk, including default and country transfer risk, is measured, monitored and controlled based on the Bank’s
economic capital calculation for credit risk. To calculate economic capital for credit risk, the Bank uses a portfolio VaR model. Management
limits the Bank’s overall exposure to credit risk by allocating an amount of economic capital to credit risk.

B. Default risk
The following tables show the exposure of the Bank to default risk, without taking into account any collateral held or other credit
enhancements available to the Bank. Credit risk is mitigated through the use of collateral and legally enforceable netting or setoff
agreements. The corresponding assets and liabilities are not offset on the balance sheet.
The exposures set out in the tables below are based on the carrying value of the assets on the balance sheet as categorised by sector,
geographical region and credit quality. The carrying value is the fair value of the financial instruments, except in the case of very short-term
financial instruments (sight and notice accounts) and gold. Commitments are reported at their notional amounts. Gold and gold loans
exclude gold bar assets held in custody, and accounts receivable do not include unsettled liabilities issued, because these items do not
represent credit exposures of the Bank.
The vast majority of the Bank’s assets are invested in securities issued by governments and financial institutions rated A– or above by at
least one of the major external credit assessment institutions. Limitations on the number of high-quality counterparties in these sectors
mean that the Bank is exposed to single-name concentration risk.
The Bank conducts an annual review for impairment at the date of each balance sheet. At 31 March 2017, the Bank did not have any
financial assets that were considered to be impaired (2016: nil). At 31 March 2017, no financial assets were considered past due (2016: nil).
No credit loss was recognised in the current period (2016: nil).

C. Credit risk mitigation

Netting
Netting agreements give the Bank a legally enforceable right to net transactions with counterparties under potential future conditions,
notably an event of default. Such master netting or similar agreements apply to counterparties with which the Bank conducts most of its
derivative transactions, as well as to counterparties used for repurchase and reverse repurchase agreement transactions. Where required,
netting is applied when determining the amount of collateral to be requested or provided, but the Bank does not settle assets and liabilities
on a net basis during the normal course of business. As such, the amounts shown on the Bank’s balance sheet are the gross amounts.

Collateral
The Bank mitigates credit risk by requiring counterparties to provide collateral. The Bank receives collateral in respect of most derivative
contracts and reverse repurchase agreements and for advances made under collateralised facility agreements. During the term of these
transactions, further collateral may be called or collateral may be released based on the movements in value of both the underlying
instrument and the collateral that has been received. The Bank is required to provide collateral in respect of repurchase agreements.
For derivative contracts and reverse repurchase agreements, the Bank accepts as collateral high-quality sovereign, state agency and
supranational securities and, in a limited number of cases, cash. For advances made under collateralised facility agreements, collateral
accepted includes currency deposits with the Bank, units in the BIS Investment Pools and gold.
Under the terms of its collateral arrangements, the Bank is permitted to sell (“re-hypothecate”) collateral received on derivative contracts
and reverse repurchase agreements, but upon expiry of the transaction must return equivalent financial instruments to the counterparty. At
31 March 2017, the Bank had lent out SDR 0.1 million of the collateral it held (2016: nil).
The fair value of collateral held which the Bank had the right to sell was:

Financial assets and liabilities subject to netting or collateralisation
The tables below show the categories of assets and liabilities which are either subject to collateralisation, or for which netting agreements
would apply under potential future conditions such as the event of default of a counterparty.
The amount of collateral required is usually based on valuations performed on the previous business day, whereas the Bank’s balance sheet
reflects the valuations of the reporting date. Due to this timing difference, the valuation of collateral can be higher than the valuation of
the underlying contract in the Bank’s balance sheet. The amount of the collateral obtained is also impacted by thresholds, minimum transfer
amounts and valuation adjustments (“haircuts”) specified in the contracts. In these tables, the mitigating effect of collateral has been limited
to the balance sheet value of the underlying net asset.

D. Economic capital for credit risk
The Bank determines economic capital for credit risk (except for FX settlement risk, which is included in the utilisation for credit risk) using
a VaR methodology on the basis of a portfolio VaR model, assuming a one-year time horizon and a 99.995% confidence level. The amount
of economic capital set aside for FX settlement risk reflected in the Bank’s economic capital calculations is based on an assessment by
Management.

E. Minimum capital requirements for credit risk

Exposure to sovereigns, banks and corporates
For the calculation of risk-weighted assets for exposures to sovereigns, banks and corporates, the Bank has adopted an approach that is
consistent with the advanced internal ratings-based approach.
As a general rule, under this approach risk-weighted assets are determined by multiplying the credit risk exposures with risk weights derived
from the relevant Basel II risk weight function using the Bank’s own estimates for key inputs. These estimates for key inputs are also relevant
to the Bank’s economic capital calculation for credit risk.
The credit risk exposure for a transaction or position is referred to as the exposure at default (EAD). The Bank determines the EAD as the
notional amount of on- and off-balance sheet credit exposures, except for securities and derivative contracts. The EAD for derivatives is
calculated using an approach consistent with the internal models method proposed under the Basel II framework. In line with this methodology,
the Bank calculates effective expected positive exposures that are then multiplied by a factor alpha as set out in the framework.
Key inputs to the risk weight function are a counterparty’s estimated one-year probability of default (PD) as well as the estimated loss-givendefault (LGD) and maturity for each transaction.
Due to the high credit quality of the Bank’s investments and the conservative credit risk management process at the BIS, the Bank is not in
a position to estimate PDs and LGDs based on its own default experience. The Bank calibrates each counterparty PD estimate through a
mapping of internal rating grades to external credit assessments taking external default data into account. Similarly, LGD estimates are
derived from external data. Where appropriate, these estimates are adjusted to reflect the risk-reducing effects of collateral obtained giving
consideration to market price volatility, re-margining and revaluation frequency. The recognition of the risk-reducing effects of collateral
obtained for derivative contracts, reverse repurchase agreements and collateralised advances is accounted for in calculating the EAD.
The table below details the calculation of risk-weighted assets. The exposures are measured taking netting and collateral benefits into
account. The total amount of exposures reported in the table as at 31 March 2017 includes SDR 142.2 million for interest rate contracts
(2016: SDR 118.9 million) and SDR 435.0 million for FX and gold contracts (2016: SDR 283.5 million). In line with the Basel II framework, the
minimum capital requirement is determined as 8% of risk-weighted assets.

Securitisation exposures
The Bank invests in highly rated securitisation exposures based on traditional, ie non-synthetic, securitisation structures. Given the scope of
the Bank’s activities, risk-weighted assets under the Basel II framework are determined according to the standardised approach for
securitisation. Under this approach, external credit assessments of the securities are used to determine the relevant risk weights. External
credit assessment institutions used for this purpose are Moody’s Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings. Risk-weighted assets
are then derived as the product of the market values of the exposures and the associated risk weights. In line with the Basel II framework,
the minimum capital requirement is determined as 8% of risk-weighted assets.
The following table shows the Bank’s investments in securitisation analysed by type of securitised assets:

4. Market risk
The Bank is exposed to market risk through adverse movements in market prices. The main components of the Bank’s market risk are gold
price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk. The Bank measures market risk and calculates economic capital based on a VaR
methodology using a Monte Carlo simulation technique. Risk factor volatilities and correlations are estimated, subject to an exponential
weighting scheme, over a six-year observation period. Furthermore, the Bank computes sensitivities to certain market risk factors.
In line with the Bank’s objective of maintaining its superior credit quality, economic capital is measured at the 99.995% confidence level
assuming a one-year holding period. The Bank calculates the economic capital utilisation for market risk on the basis of a stressed market
data set. The Bank’s Management manages market risk economic capital usage within a framework set by the Board of Directors. VaR limits
are supplemented by operating limits.
To ensure that models provide a reliable measure of potential losses over the one-year time horizon, the Bank has established a comprehensive
regular backtesting framework, comparing daily performance with corresponding VaR estimates. The results are analysed and reported to
Management.
The Bank also supplements its market risk measurement based on VaR modelling and related economic capital calculations with a series of
stress tests. These include severe historical scenarios, adverse hypothetical macroeconomic scenarios and sensitivity tests of gold price,
interest rate and foreign exchange rate movements.

236

BIS 87th Annual Report

A. Gold price risk
Gold price risk is the exposure of the Bank’s financial condition to adverse movements in the price of gold.
The Bank is exposed to gold price risk principally through its holdings of gold investment assets. These gold investment assets are held in
custody or placed on deposit with commercial banks. At 31 March 2017, the Bank’s net gold investment assets were 103 tonnes with a value
of SDR 3,048.5 million (2016: 104 tonnes, SDR 2,944.6 million), approximately 16% of its equity (2016: 16%). The Bank sometimes also has
small exposures to gold price risk arising from its banking activities with central and commercial banks. Gold price risk is measured within
the Bank’s VaR methodology, including its economic capital framework and stress tests.

B. Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the exposure of the Bank’s financial condition to adverse movements in interest rates including credit spreads. The Bank
is exposed to interest rate risk through the interest-bearing assets relating to the management of its equity held in its investment portfolios
and investments relating to its banking portfolios. The investment portfolios are managed using a fixed-duration benchmark of bonds.
The Bank measures and monitors interest rate risk using a VaR methodology and sensitivity analyses taking into account movements in
relevant money market rates, government bond yields, swap rates and credit spreads.
The following tables show the impact on the Bank’s equity of a 1% upward shift in the relevant yield curve per time band:

C. Foreign exchange risk
The Bank’s functional currency, the SDR, is a composite currency comprising fixed amounts of USD, EUR, JPY, GBP and Renminbi. Currency
risk is the exposure of the Bank’s financial condition to adverse movements in exchange rates. The Bank is exposed to foreign exchange risk
primarily through the assets relating to the management of its equity. The Bank is also exposed to foreign exchange risk through managing
its customer deposits and through acting as an intermediary in foreign exchange transactions. The Bank reduces its foreign exchange
exposures by matching the relevant assets to the constituent currencies of the SDR on a regular basis, and by limiting currency exposures
arising from customer deposits and foreign exchange transaction intermediation.
The following tables show the Bank’s assets and liabilities by currency and gold exposure. The net foreign exchange and gold position in
these tables therefore includes the Bank’s gold investments. To determine the Bank’s net foreign exchange exposure, the gold amounts need
to be removed. The SDR-neutral position is then deducted from the net foreign exchange position excluding gold to arrive at the net
currency exposure of the Bank on an SDR-neutral basis.

D. Economic capital for market risk
The Bank measures market risk based on a VaR methodology using a Monte Carlo simulation technique taking correlations between risk
factors into account. Economic capital for market risk is also calculated following this methodology measured to the 99.995% confidence
level and assuming a one-year holding period. The Bank calculates the economic capital utilisation for market risk on the basis of a stressed
market data set. The stressed data set is subject to regular review and calibrated to take account of the Bank’s key market risk exposures
and market risk drivers.
The Bank measures its gold price risk relative to changes in the USD value of gold. The foreign exchange risk component, resulting from
changes in the USD exchange rate versus the SDR, is included in the measurement of foreign exchange risk. The following table shows the
key figures of the Bank’s exposure to market risk in terms of economic capital utilisation over the past two financial years:

E. Minimum capital requirements for market risk
For the calculation of minimum capital requirements for market risk under the Basel II framework, the Bank has adopted a banking book
approach consistent with the scope and nature of its business activities. Consequently, market risk-weighted assets are determined for gold
price risk and foreign exchange risk, but not for interest rate risk. The related minimum capital requirement is derived using the VaR-based
internal models method. Under this method, VaR calculations are performed using the Bank’s VaR methodology, assuming a 99% confidence
level and a 10-day holding period.
The actual minimum capital requirement is derived as the higher of the VaR on the calculation date and the average of the daily VaR
measures on each of the preceding 60 business days (including the calculation date) subject to a multiplication factor of three plus a
potential add-on depending on backtesting results. For the period under consideration, the number of backtesting outliers observed
remained within the range where no add-on is required. The following table summarises the market risk development relevant to the
calculation of minimum capital requirements and the related risk-weighted assets over the reporting period.

5. Operational risk
Operational risk is defined by the Bank as the risk of financial loss, or damage to the Bank’s reputation, or both, resulting from one or more
risk causes, as outlined below:

•

Human factors: insufficient personnel, lack of requisite knowledge, skills or experience, inadequate training and development, inadequate
supervision, loss of key personnel, inadequate succession planning, or lack of integrity or ethical standards.

•

Failed or inadequate processes: a process is poorly designed or unsuitable, or is not properly documented, understood, implemented,
followed or enforced.

•
•

Failed or inadequate systems: a system is poorly designed, unsuitable or unavailable, or does not operate as intended.
External events: the occurrence of an event having an adverse impact on the Bank but outside its control.

Operational risk includes legal risk, but excludes strategic risk.
The Bank’s operational risk management framework, policies and procedures comprise the management and measurement of operational
risk, including the determination of the relevant key parameters and inputs, business continuity planning and the monitoring of key risk
indicators.
The Bank has established a procedure of immediate reporting for operational risk-related incidents. The Operational Risk Management unit
develops action plans with the respective units and follows up on their implementation on a regular basis.
For the measurement of operational risk economic capital and operational risk-weighted assets, the Bank has adopted a VaR approach using
a Monte Carlo simulation technique that is consistent with the advanced measurement approach proposed under the Basel II framework.
In line with the assumptions of the Basel II framework, the quantification of operational risk does not take reputational risk into account.
Internal and external loss data, scenario estimates and control self-assessments to reflect changes in the business and control environment
of the Bank are key inputs in the calculations. In quantifying its operational risk, the Bank does not take potential protection it may obtain
from insurance into account.

A. Economic capital for operational risk
Consistent with the parameters used in the calculation of economic capital for financial risk, the Bank measures economic capital for
operational risk to the 99.995% confidence level assuming a one-year holding period. The following table shows the key figures of the
Bank’s exposure to operational risk in terms of economic capital utilisation over the past two financial years:

6. Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises when the Bank may not be able to meet expected or unexpected current or future cash flows and collateral needs
without affecting its daily operations or its financial condition.
The Bank’s currency and gold deposits, principally from central banks and international institutions, comprise 92% (2016: 89%) of its total
liabilities. At 31 March 2017, currency and gold deposits originated from 169 depositors (2016: 167 depositors). Within these deposits, there
are significant individual customer concentrations, with four customers each contributing in excess of 5% of the total on a settlement date
basis (2016: five customers).
Outstanding balances in the currency and gold deposits from central banks, international organisations and other public institutions are the
key drivers of the size of the Bank’s balance sheet. The Bank is exposed to funding liquidity risk mainly because of the short-term nature of
its deposits and because it undertakes to repurchase at fair value certain of its currency deposit instruments at one or two business days’
notice. In line with the Bank’s objective to maintain a high level of liquidity, it has developed a liquidity management framework, including
a ratio, based on conservative assumptions for estimating the liquidity available and the liquidity required.

A. Maturity profile of cash flows
The following tables show the maturity profile of cash flows for assets and liabilities. The amounts disclosed are the undiscounted cash flows
to which the Bank is committed. Options are included in the table at fair value and are shown in the “Up to 1 month” category.

B. Liquidity ratio
The Bank has adopted a liquidity risk framework taking into account regulatory guidance issued by the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision related to the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR). The framework is based on a liquidity ratio that compares the Bank’s available
liquidity with a liquidity requirement over a one-month time horizon assuming a stress scenario. In line with the Basel III liquidity framework,
the underlying stress scenario combines an idiosyncratic and a market crisis. However, the liquidity ratio differs in construction from the LCR
to reflect the nature and scope of the BIS banking activities − in particular, the short-term nature of the Bank’s assets and liabilities. Within
the Bank’s liquidity framework, the Board of Directors has set a limit for the Bank’s liquidity ratio which requires the liquidity available to be
at least 100% of the potential liquidity requirement.
The following table provides information on the development of the Bank’s liquidity ratio for the last two years:

151.0%

Average
140.0%

High
164.2%

Low
112.6%

At 31 March
140.2%

The liquidity available is determined as the cash inflow from financial instruments over a one-month horizon, along with potential additional
liquidity which could be generated from the disposal of highly liquid securities, or by entering into sale and repurchase agreements for a
part of the Bank’s remaining unencumbered high-quality liquid securities. In calculating the amount of potential additional liquidity, an
assessment is performed to identify securities which are of high credit quality and highly liquid. This is followed by a projection of the
amounts that could reasonably be generated through selling these securities or entering into repurchase transactions.
The Bank determines the liquidity required as the sum of the cash outflow from financial instruments over a one-month horizon, the
estimated early withdrawal of currency deposits, and the estimated drawings of undrawn facilities. As regards currency deposits, it is assumed
that all deposits that mature within the time horizon are not rolled over and that a proportion of non-maturing currency deposits is
withdrawn from the Bank prior to contractual maturity. At 31 March 2017, the estimated outflow of currency deposits in response to the
stress scenario amounted to 44.6% (2016: 49.8%) of the total stock of currency deposits. Moreover, it is assumed that undrawn facilities
committed by the Bank would be fully drawn by customers, along with a proportion of undrawn uncommitted facilities.

For reference, the Bank also calculates an LCR following the principles set out in the guidance issued by the BCBS. At 31 March 2017, the
Bank’s LCR stood at 198.2% (2016: 208.5%).

Independent auditor’s report
To the Board of Directors and to the General Meeting
of the Bank for International Settlements, Basel

Report on the audit of the financial statements
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of the Bank for International Settlements, which comprise the
statement of financial position as at 31 March 2017, the statement of comprehensive income, statement
of changes in equity and statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial
statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.
In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial
position of the Bank for International Settlements as at 31 March 2017 and of its financial performance
and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the accounting principles described in the
financial statements and the Statutes of the Bank.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities
under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial
statements section of our report. We are independent of the Bank for International Settlements in
accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional
Accountants (IESBA Code) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the
financial statements in Switzerland, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance
with these requirements and the IESBA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Responsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the financial statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in
accordance with the accounting principles described in the financial statements and the Statutes of the
Bank, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Bank for
International Settlement’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related
to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to
liquidate the Bank for International Settlement or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but
to do so.
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Bank for International Settlement’s
financial reporting process.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an
audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.

248

BIS 87th Annual Report

Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate,
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of
these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain
professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
•

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to
fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not
detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error,
as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of
internal control.

•

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Bank for International Settlement’s internal control.

•

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by management.

•

Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting
and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events
or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Bank for International Settlement’s ability to
continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to
draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if
such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit
evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may
cause the Bank for International Settlements to cease to continue as a going concern.

•

Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the
disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events
in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in
internal control that we identify during our audit.
